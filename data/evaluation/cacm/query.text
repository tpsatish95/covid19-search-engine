 I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,
possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment.  I would
rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations,
as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem.  Remote procedure
calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.
.I 5

 I'd like papers on design and implementation of editing interfaces,
window-managers, command interpreters, etc.  The essential issues are
human interface design, with views on improvements to user efficiency,
effectiveness and satisfaction.

 Interested in articles on robotics, motion planning particularly the
geometric and combinatorial aspects.  We are not interested in the
dynamics of arm motion.

 I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition
in digital image processing.  Applications include finding approximations
to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An
article on the subject is H.C. Andrews and C.L. Patterson "Outer product
expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical
Monthly, vol. 82.
.I 32

 I'd like to find articles describing graph algorithms that are based on
the eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) of the
ajacency matrix for the graph.  I'm especially interested in any heuristic
algorithms for graph coloring and graph isomorphism using this method.
.I 33
.W
 Articles about the sensitivity of the eigenvalue decomposition of real
matrices, in particular, zero-one matrices.  I'm especially interested in
the separation of eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.

SIAM J. Numerical Analysis, vol. 7, no. 1 (1970); G.W. Stewart, "Error
bounds for approximate invariant subspaces of closed linear operators",

.I 35

 Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency
(e.g. what is the type of a process?  when is a synchronization attempt 
between two processes "type correct"?  in a message-passing system is there
any notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the sender
of the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as some
particular type)
.I 36
.W
 What is the type of a module?	(I don't want the entire literature on
Abstract Data Types here, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to avoid it.
I'm interested in questions about how one can check that a module "matches"
contexts in which it is used.)
.I 37
.W
 What does type compatibility mean in languages that allow programmer
defined types?  (You might want to restrict this to "extensible" languages
that allow definition of abstract data types or programmer-supplied
definitions of operators like *, +.)

 List all articles dealing with data types in the following languages:
Pascal, CLU, Alphard, Russell, Ada, ALGOL 68, EL1.  List any other languages
