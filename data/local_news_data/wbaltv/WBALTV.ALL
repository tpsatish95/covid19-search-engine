Annapolis Styrofoam ban to begin in September
.W
The prohibition on expanded polystyrene foam food service products is expected to begin in Annapolis.

The prohibition on expanded polystyrene, or EPS, foam food service products is expected to begin in Annapolis. These products, commonly referred to by the trademarked name Styrofoam, are prohibited for use and sale at food service businesses and grocery and convenience stores in the city of Annapolis as of Sept. 1.Earlier this year, the city mailed letters to all food service businesses and grocers to begin using up the product in order to be in compliance. The grace period ran from Oct. 22, 2018, to Sept. 1. After Sept. 1, businesses using EPS foam for food service will be fined $100 for the first offense and $200 for subsequent violations.This measure is an important step toward protecting lands,  streams and rivers and the Chesapeake Bay according to the Annapolis Office of Environmental Policy. EPS foam is not recyclable and, once discarded, persists in the environment. It is not biodegradable.  Instead, EPS breaks down into small pieces dangerous to fish and wildlife according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Anne Arundel County and the state of Maryland have passed similar bans with future effective dates. EPS foam is banned in the following products: cups, bowls, plates, takeout containers, clamshells and trays. The ban impacts restaurants (full, fast and self-service), grocery stores, vending trucks, food carts, institutional cafeterias and other businesses that sell or provide food for consumption on- or off-premise. Businesses may use containers composed of compostable materials, paper, plant (sugarcane, rice, bamboo), as well as aluminum and glass.             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

Do you know what's in CBD products? I-Team tests them out in lab
.W
CBD is now legal with no prescription necessary, but it's also largely unregulated, which means consumers don't always know what they're getting.

CBD is now legal with no prescription necessary, but it's also largely unregulated, which means consumers don't always know what they're getting.CBD is derived from cannabis or hemp, but it contains very little or no THC so it does not make you high. Some people said it helps with a wide range of ailments from pain to anxiety."Everyone is just trying to jump on the bandwagon. You have grocery stores, gas stations, liquor stores and corner stores that are selling this stuff," said Nicholas Patrick, owner of Embrace CBD Wellness Center in Glen Burnie.Many retailers are selling CBD products, but no one is regulating them. "That's absolutely true. At this current moment, there are no (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) guidelines, no FDA restrictions. They have a very loose enforcement policy. So, when you're buying CBD, you could be taking a potentially harmful product," Patrick said.Patrick said all of his products are tested by third-party labs, and customers can see a lab report and a certificate of analysis showing what is in the product.  The 11 News I-Team decided to test some CBD products, purchased elsewhere. They included eight oils and seven gummy packets, purchased from both brick-and-mortar stores and internet retailers.  The I-Team covered the product name, labeled the items and took them to Atlantic Test Labs in Millersville, which is independently accredited for testing products containing CBD and also approved by the state of Maryland for medical cannabis testing. "These are samples that are supplied by WBAL-TV. They're from suppliers around the country. They were all submitted blindly with expected concentrations. We're going to verify that analytically," said Scott Robertson, of Atlantic Test Labs.Atlantic Test Labs scientists Robertson and Amanda Horodyski checked for things like the amount of CBD in the product and the presence of harmful elements such as heavy metals, pesticides or mold. They also checked for THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. A THC content of 0.3 percent or less is legal in Maryland. None of the samples contained heavy metals, pesticides or mold and no THC was detected above the legal limit. Most of the gummies tested contained amounts of CBD inconsistent with package labels."Three gummies were significantly lower than their label claims. One of them was zero, it did not have any CBD at all," Robertson said.The product the scientists said had no CBD was the Jolly Green Oil CBD Edible Party Pack. When the I-Team contacted the manufacturer, a woman who would only identify herself as a manager named "Janet" sent the I-Team a photo of the back of the product and said: "Every product that leaves our factory is stamped with a holographic scannable QR code to prove that it is an authentic product we manufactured."  There was no such code on the bag the I-Team purchased."Therefore, I am still unable to verify that this is our product. In the next few weeks, we are launching printed bags as well to avoid any fraudulent products being produced," Janet said.  A third-party lab on Jolly Green Oil's website shows potency in line with the label claim.  Atlantic Test Labs stands by the results it found. So how do you know you're getting a good product? The consumer really needs to do their homework."The consumer needs to be really aware that they're not getting a product that has been thoroughly tested unless they verify that it has been," Robertson said. That can be difficult. Most of the products the I-Team purchased and tested did not come with a lab report or did not provide a complete analysis."So you want to look for those pesticides, heavy metals, micro-contamination and especially the THC content in it as well," Horodyski said.Patrick said the industry is in desperate need of regulation. "I'm hoping that the FDA steps in soon and does what they have to do to hold these CBD companies accountable to what they're putting inside of their product. There's a lot of hemp being grown, and God knows what's in the soil where that hemp is being grown," Patrick said.An FDA spokesperson said the agency held hearings about CBD regulation last May and plans to have a status update by early fall.

Two new male cheetahs are debuting at the Maryland Zoo.Brothers Bud and Davis arrived in March from the Lee G. Simmons Conservation Park and Wildlife Safari in Ashland, Nebraska. The 4-year-old pair completed their mandatory quarantine and are making their debut to the public in the African Journey area of the zoo.Cheetah, the world's fastest land mammal, are also the most endangered cat in Africa. Historically native to Africa and Asia from South Africa to India, cheetah can now only be found in parts of eastern, central and southwestern Africa, as well as a small portion of Iran.Cheetah are facing extinction due to habitat loss, the illegal wildlife trade and human-wildlife conflict.

Certain lumber quarantined in Baltimore after thousand cankers disease detected

Select lumber is being quarantined in Baltimore City and part of Baltimore County after thousand cankers disease was detected in a Baltimore industrial area.

Select lumber is being quarantined in Baltimore City and part of Baltimore County after thousand cankers disease was detected in a Baltimore industrial area.The Maryland Department of Agriculture enacted a quarantine Wednesday, effective immediately, that makes it illegal for anyone to move any walnut material and hardwood firewood out of a 185 square mile area that includes all of Baltimore City and the southeast corner of Baltimore County.The quarantine is designed to prevent the spread of thousand cankers disease, and restricts movement out of the quarantined area of all walnut material without a certificate of inspection for this pest. This includes nursery stock, budwood, scionwood, green lumber and firewood. It also covers other walnut material that is living, dead, cut or fallen, including stumps, roots, branches, mulch and composted and un-composted chips. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing between species of hardwood firewood, all hardwood firewood is considered quarantined.Nuts, processed lumber and finished wood products without bark are exempt from the quarantine.Walnut trees become diseased when walnut twig beetles, which carry the fungus, tunnel beneath walnut bark, causing small cankers to form. The beetles, dark brown and about the size of a poppy seed, are extremely difficult to detect. As more beetles attack, cankers increase, slowly starving the tree of nutrients, killing it within 10 years of initial infestation.Early symptoms include the yellowing of leaves and foliage-thinning of the tree’s upper crown. As the disease progresses, larger limbs die, followed by the trunk.An existing quarantine is also in effect in Cecil County.Thousand cankers disease is a disease complex native to the western United States that primarily affects black walnut and is the result of the combined activity of a fungus and the walnut twig beetle.People who suspect they have seen thousand cankers disease should contact their local county extension office or MDA’s Plant Protection section at ppwm.mda@maryland.gov or 410-841-5920.

Some neighborhoods in Baltimore struggle to find access to healthy food. People in the Govans neighborhood, with the help of Loyola University, are community champions making a difference.At 3 p.m. on Wednesdays, the Govans Towne Farmers Market in the 5100 block of York Road is bustling with activity. Florence Washington takes the bus to get there."I like the fresh food. It's helping me with my lunch and dinner," Washington said. "It's hard to get to the store. Like me, I use a walker -- all I got to do is come out the building and come right here," said resident Loretta Hurte.Ten years ago, Loyola University and partners in the York Road corridor looked at how they could address the community's needs."One of the things that bubbled to the top was increasing food access. They don't have a grocery store in the area, have a high percentage of seniors and folks without access to vehicles," said Erin O'Keefef, of Loyola University.A year later, the Govans Towne Farmers Market was born. Tee Hardy is a longtime resident."Our closest grocery store is 13 blocks that way, 22 blocks that way and 11 blocks that way. Most you're gonna get is a chicken box," Hardy said.Customers can use their benefits to buy groceries. Benefits from both the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and its Women, Infants and Children program are accepted. "This is one of the places that allows us to get fresh fruits and vegetables every Wednesday. Loyola also provides the fresh crate program," Hardy said.Loyola buys produce at cost and sells it to corner stores on York Road. It delivers year-round. Khawar Jamil said his family food market is grateful to take part."So easy for customers to come and get fresh food, helping my business, plus the community," said Jamil said. "Every other day we have a fresh delivery coming in."Because of this program, you can get a basket full of food for $10.The Gedco Cares Food Pantry gives customers coupons to use for produce at participating corner stores. These programs help people on fixed incomes, and those who have limited access to get around to thrive. ​             BALTIMORE

Sandra the orangutan, freed from a zoo after being granted 'personhood,' settles into her new home

A 33-year-old orangutan who was granted "legal personhood" in Argentina has been relocated to a new home in Florida.

A 33-year-old orangutan who was granted "legal personhood" in Argentina has been relocated to a new home in Wauchula, Florida.Patti Ragan, director of the Center for Great Apes, where Sandra the orangutan is now living, told CNN she has been "inquisitive, calm, engaged and interested in her new surroundings" since her arrival Tuesday."She was shy when she first arrived, but once she saw the swings, toys, and grassy areas in her new home, she went out to explore," Ragan said in a press release.The orangutan captured the world's attention when she was at the center of a 2015 Argentina court case.After living in captivity for 20 years at the Buenos Aires Zoo, Sandra was declared a "nonhuman being" by Judge Elena Liberatori, an unprecedented ruling that gave the orangutan basic rights including life, freedom and a premise of "no harm" either physically or psychologically.But there was one problem: There were no orangutan sanctuaries in Argentina, so Liberatori asked the Center for Great Apes to take in Sandra, as it is the only accredited sanctuary for orangutans in the Americas.Related video: Heartwarming video of a mama orangutan and her baby being rescued and given a new home:Sandra was sent to the Sedgwick County Zoo in Kansas for a monthlong quarantine before arriving at the center in Florida, where she was promised lifetime care.There are 22 orangutans, including Sandra, and 31 chimpanzees at the center. The apes were rescued from circuses, stage shows, roadside attractions, labs and the exotic pet trade, the Center for Great Apes said."Her fame will help to bring more awareness of how very special and sentient great apes are, as well as the terrible threats facing their species in the wild in Borneo and Sumatra," Ragan told CNN. "Habitat destruction caused by logging, mining, and palm oil farming is causing the loss of hundreds of orangutans just as smart and lovely as Sandra."The zoo, meanwhile, was closed down in 2016 and is now being converted into an Ecoparque, a facility for Argentine native wildlife that will open in 2023.

From cherry pies to turkeys and mashed potatoes, two sisters are on a mission to make sure families in need have the Thanksgiving dinners they deserve.For the third year in a row, Alex Fischer, 9, and her sister Caroline, 6, are raising money to provide meals for North Carolina families that can't afford the traditional holiday feast.A small service project turns into a big tradition"We started this as a service project in 2017 for the family to do in the holidays," the girls' mom, Lisa Fischer, told CNN. "When I initially suggested we donated one box of food, Alex said that wasn't enough and that we should do 10 boxes."Fischer pointed out to her daughter how much a full Thanksgiving meal would cost. She explained that paying for 10 meals would not be something the family could do without financial help.Determined to get the 10 boxes of food, the girls decided to open up a lemonade and baked goods stand to raise funds.It didn't take long for family, friends and even strangers to reach out to help, so the Fischer family set up a GoFundMe page."The first year, we raised enough money for 100 boxes of food," Fischer said.Since the first year went so well, they decided to make it a tradition.Surpassing expectationsLast year, the girls raised enough money for 130 boxes of food and 50 turkeys. And as of this Friday, the girls have surpassed their expectations. They have raised $2,896 for their 2019 Thanksgiving mission, which would allow them to provide 108 boxes filled with Thanksgiving meal staples and 108 turkeys."The girls are always excited when they see their friends, teachers and neighbors show up to their lemonade stand, but they are too young to understand how much attention they're actually getting," Fischer said. "They just know this means a lot of people will be able to have Thanksgiving dinner," she added.The Fischers usually start gathering funds at the end of September. They go as a family to their local grocery store and buy all the food needed. Then they take the supplies to the Charlotte Rescue Mission's headquarters, a nonprofit that provides services for people struggling with addiction, which holds an annual Thanksgiving food drive."We are hoping to recruit some help from the neighbors to pack the boxes this year, rent out a truck and deliver the food by Nov. 23," Fischer explained.The spirit of the holidays is all about showing gratitude for your good fortune, and the Fischer family is thankful they have the support to give to families in need.

Fake grocery store trucks were smuggling migrants, Mexico says
.W
"(It) was camouflage to transport migrants," Mexico's president said.

Mexican officials said Monday they have uncovered an industrial-scale migrant smuggling ring using tractor-trailer rigs disguised as freight deliveries for major companies.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said authorities found a tractor-trailer disguised with the logo of a major grocery store chain. But instead of groceries, it was carrying about 150 migrants."The (grocery) company has filed a complaint, because it was fake, it was camouflage to transport migrants," Lopez Obrador said.In June, Mexico detected five freight trucks carrying 925 migrants, almost all of them from Central America. Some of those trucks bore the logos of well-known firms, though it was not clear if those trucks were also fakes or had been used illegally by drivers without the companies' knowledge.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said four or five of the freight trucks found in June belonged to the same independent trucking company, based in central Mexico.Ebrard said the company operated trucks equipped with air-conditioning units, but those weren't turned on when carrying migrants."The risk they are putting people in, half of them are minors," Ebrard said. "They are locking them in trailers to cross the entire country. They leave them there for hours, they could die of asphyxia."It led officials to believe it was just a matter of time before migrants would die aboard the overcrowded vehicles."The biggest concern is that there is going to be a tragedy, that is what we don't want," said Lopez Obrador.

Plastic bag ban proposed in Baltimore City
.W
The Baltimore City Council will discuss new legislation that would ban plastic bags in stores and impose a tax on other varieties.

The Baltimore City Council will discuss new legislation that would ban plastic bags in stores and impose a tax on other varieties.Councilman Bill Henry will introduced the Comprehensive Bag Reduction Bill Monday, which bans all plastic bags at the point of sale. Other bags, such as paper bags and compostable bags, will be subject to a checkout bag surcharge of 5 cents. The surcharge would be imposed in the store, at pickup or upon delivery. Retailers would keep 1 cents of the fee to help pay for the additional paper bag cost, and 4 cents would go to the city to purchase and distribute free reusable bags for residents."There were concerns that without that fee, you wouldn't' get any actual behavior modifications towards reusuable bag use, that all that would happen is people would take paper bags instead of taking plastic bags," Henry said.Henry said the legislation is about making Baltimore cleaner, safer and more sustainable.The legislation would also repeal the plastic bag reduction program, which is a voluntary program for stores that have food licenses to register and maintain records on their bag usage.Dining-in is a big part of the business at Holy Frioles in Hampden, but when customers do carry food out, it's usually in a plastic bag. "They're just the cheapest, most efficient option. When we have the opportunity, we do buy the corn-material bags, but they can be difficult to keep in stock, like, they're not always at the restaurant depot when we go," said Nick Jankowski, general manager at Holy Frioles.Consumers are on both sides of the debate."I'm against it because I just don't even see how it's going to work. If you think about the self -checkouts in the store, how are they going to get paper in there and plastic out of there? It's just going to be a logistical nightmare. I don't see it working and I don't know exactly what the benefit is going to be," said Robert Ahlfedlt."I think it's easy to grab (reusable) bags and keep them in your car, I just don't because (plastic ones) are always available. So it's kind of nice to be forced to make the decision," said Hadassah Mendez.In May, the Baltimore City Council passed a ban on polystyrene products. The bill bans expanded polystyrene, or EPS, foam food containers, often confused with Styrofoam, from being used by restaurants, grocery stores and other food providers. The bill also bans the retail sale of these products. The bill passed 34-13, with bipartisan support.Maryland is the first state to ban foam food containers.This is the ninth time the council has tried to pass some form of a plastic bag ban. The bill now heads to a committee.​             BALTIMORE

Lexington Market vendors, patrons find new food stamp rules limiting
.W
Changes to the federal food stamp program have hit some vendors' bottom lines as they can no longer accept EBT cards for certain items, leaving the vendors and some patrons frustrated.

Changes to the federal food stamp program have hit some vendors' bottom lines as they can no longer accept EBT cards for certain items, leaving the vendors and some patrons frustrated.For people like Anthony Pasley, shopping at Lexington Market is a way of life."I've been shopping here, my grandmother, it has been a tradition to come here to Lexington Market and get everything you want," Pasley said.Pasley is disabled and can't get to any other grocery stores. He uses food stamps and recently hasn't been able to get everything he needs."I can buy fish, I can buy greens, some fruit, chicken, eggs, but I like lunchmeat every now and then. I want some lunchmeat to make a sandwich, and they're telling me I can't do it," Pasley said.The owner of Mary Mervis Delicatessen, Elliot Bodner, said new regulations don't allow patrons to use an EBT card to buy processed meat, baked goods or certain other items."In the big stores, the chain stores -- Wegmans, Giant, Safeway -- you can buy anything in the market you want and pay with food stamps. Why? Because they have one register area for the entire market. We are independent merchants, so because of that, they say we don't qualify," Bodner said.Vendors who sell raw meat or produce can still accept food stamps, but several merchants are seeing a big dip in sales."We are 50-percent down from the sales we had," one vendor said. "My manager was here for 22 years. I had to let her go. (I) had another fellow, counter cook, 17 years. (I) can't afford to keep him. It has hurt my business so bad," Bodner said. "They're trying to put the little guy out of business, basically."Several lawmakers from Maryland sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking them to investigate the change in food stamp eligibility. The vendors and patrons hope changes come before it's too late. "It's just sad, it's sad. What has this man or us done to anybody to stop us from getting a sandwich? Just a cold sandwich," Pasley said.The USDA sent 11 News a statement, saying, "Lexington Market includes a variety of vendors.  These vendors are currently undergoing SNAP reauthorization, as required at least once every five years, to determine their continued eligibility to participate in SNAP.  Some of those vendors sell eligible staple foods and must simply submit information and complete their reauthorization process.  Others may operate primarily as ineligible restaurants providing largely hot and prepared food items, or bakeries that sell only accessory items.  Each vendor is being or will be assessed carefully to determine whether they meet or continue to meet SNAP eligibility criteria based on law and regulation."             BALTIMORE

'It just blows us away': Humane society finds homes for 250 animals one week before hurricane
.W
"It just blows us away. These are people who may have to evacuate themselves, and they're taking a pet with them."

No one should have to brave a hurricane alone. Luckily for the animal residents of the Jacksonville Humane Society, they'll spend Hurricane Dorian in new foster homes.In less than a week, about 250 dogs and cats were moved out of the shelter and into the homes of temporary foster families called Storm Troopers. They'll take care of the pets until at least Friday, once Dorian has dissipated, the shelter said."It just blows us away," CEO Denise Deisler told CNN. "These are people who may have to evacuate themselves, and they're taking a pet with them."By Monday, the shelter had gotten all of its animals out except for two dogs quarantined for biting, some nursing cats and their kittens and a few medical patients. They'll all ride out the storm with the shelter's skeleton crew, Deisler said.These urgent housing pushes are nothing new for the Jacksonville shelter, she said."There have been so many hurricanes," she said. "We've gotten an awful lot of practice."While the shelter is solid and safe, the howling wind and slapping rain that will likely accompany Dorian could frighten and rile up the animals. When they're in a home with dedicated foster parents and don't have to compete with hundreds of other pets for attention, they'll feel safer and calmer, she said.And even if Jacksonville dodges the brunt of the storm, neighboring shelters might be less lucky. If the shelter is mostly empty, staff can rescue animals from other shelters at capacity.While the fosters' status as Storm Troopers is temporary, Deisler said she's hopeful fostering will turn into a permanent gig for many pet parents."Really, we hope that they'll fall in love while they're out in homes and they never come back," she said. "All they need to do is give us a call."             JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

Plastic bag ban debate focuses on pollution, business

A bill to ban plastic bags in Baltimore City has been more than a decade in the making -- and debate Tuesday focused on pollution and business.

A bill to ban plastic bags in Baltimore City has been more than a decade in the making -- and debate Tuesday focused on pollution and business.The measure, which was introduced in 2006, is moving a step closer to a final decision as City Council members heard public testimony Tuesday morning over whether it will cut pollution or drive business away."There are thousands of unwanted plastic bags littering the streets of my city and our great state. They lie in our gutters, ending up in the Chesapeake Bay," said the Rev. Cheryl Bryant, a resident and community organizer. "Nobody wants these bags."The idea is to get rid of single-use plastic bags at a retailer's point of sale in order to cut plastic pollution and change behavior.The Baltimore City Health Department, the Baltimore City Department of Public Works and the National Aquarium spoke in support of the measure."By eliminating standard plastic grocery bags, Baltimore will reduce the number of bags littering neighborhoods and local waterways," said Jennifer Driban, with the National Aquarium.The proposal calls for steep penalties for noncompliance.The quasi-public Baltimore Development Corp., retailers and restaurants oppose the measure.Detractors said the bill is a financial blow the city cannot afford, "particularly grocery stores who we have spent a very long time trying to retain and attract to the city," said Kristin Dawson, with the Baltimore Development Corp.Opponents are concerned about logistics and cross-contamination."Consumers flat out don't want to put those items -- like a suit -- in a bag they use to carry their onions and meat around," said Cailey Locklair, with the Maryland Retailers Association."Putting our product in a bag that somebody brought in the store, I'm not comfortable with that because of all the health reasons," said Maria Vaccaro, with Vaccaro's.The next step will be a work session, during which, council members said, will be a chance to iron out language and consider amendments.

Fayette St. is home to the seal rehabilitation facility, and the animals that are kept there often need special care.The center has two suites that allow rescue workers to quarantine sick animals, if needed, allowing the staff to rescue even more animals."It is really a behind-the-scenes facility, so they're seeing our staff work on things that aren't on display, aren't on exhibit at the main aquarium but are really important and vital to the work of the aquarium -- food preparation, quarantine, making sure that animals are healthy and safe to go out into our long-term populations," said Kate Shaffer, rehabilitation manager of animal rescue.Since opening the new center about a year ago, the aquarium has rehabilitated and released five seals.Visitors must be at least 8 years old, and all visitors under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a paying adult.

The Maryland Zoo is welcoming 21-year-old Alex the chimpanzee, joining The Maryland Zoo troop from the Potawatomi Zoo in South Bend, Indiana.Alex arrived in early April based on a recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan and recently completed a standard 30-day quarantine. During the quarantine period, Alex was able to see and hear the other chimpanzees in Chimpanzee Forest.Last week, he began one-on-one introductions and he will be slowly introduced to the troop of 11, including three other males and eight females ranging in age from 12- to 47-years-old."Alex came from a very small troop in Indiana. He lived there with two females," Pam Carter, Chimpanzee Forest Area Manager at the zoo, said in a statement. "Since The Maryland Zoo has a much larger, dynamic troop, his introduction process will be strategic and unhurried. We monitor behaviors and reactions very closely. Our hope is that over time he'll grow confident and comfortable around everyone and settle into the troop."Chimpanzees (P. troglodytes) are classified as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. One of the greatest threats to wild chimpanzees is loss of their African forest habitat due to commercial logging, agriculture and fires. Poaching and disease also put the wild population at risk.             BALTIMORE (The Maryland Zoo)

California bans hotels from using tiny plastic bottles filled with shampoo, soap
.W
The law takes effect in 2023 for hotels with more than 50 rooms and 2024 for hotels with less than 50 rooms.

Hotels in the nation's most populous state will have to stop giving guests small plastic shampoo bottles under a new law set to take effect in 2023.Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday he had signed a law banning hotels from giving guests plastic bottles filled with shampoo, conditioner or soap. It takes effect in 2023 for hotels with more than 50 rooms and in 2024 for hotels with less than 50 rooms.Violators could be fined $500 for a first offense and $2,000 for subsequent violations.The law follows similar actions by some of the world's largest hotel chains. Marriott International has said it plans to stop using small plastic bottles in its hotel rooms by December 2020. IHG, which owns Holiday Inn, Kimpton and other brands, said it will eliminate about 200 million small bottles by 2021.Last year, Walt Disney Co. said it would get rid of small plastic shampoo bottles at its resorts and cruise ships.The law comes as California officials are trying to reduce the amount of plastic waste. The state already bans grocery stores from giving customers single-use plastic bags without charging a fee. Last year, former Gov. Jerry Brown passed a law allowing restaurants to hand out plastic straws only upon request.The Personal Care Products Council opposed the legislation, arguing it would hurt personal care product manufacturers.Related video: Holiday Inn to get rid of mini-shampoo bottles by 2021                        Hotels in the nation's most populous state will have to stop giving guests small plastic shampoo bottles under a new law set to take effect in 2023.

Advertisement                       Violators could be fined $500 for a first offense and $2,000 for subsequent violations. The law follows similar actions by some of the world's largest hotel chains. Marriott International has said it plans to stop using small plastic bottles in its hotel rooms by December 2020. IHG, which owns Holiday Inn, Kimpton and other brands, said it will eliminate about 200 million small bottles by 2021. Last year, Walt Disney Co. said it would get rid of small plastic shampoo bottles at its resorts and cruise ships. The law comes as California officials are trying to reduce the amount of plastic waste. The state already bans grocery stores from giving customers single-use plastic bags without charging a fee. Last year, former Gov. Jerry Brown passed a law allowing restaurants to hand out plastic straws only upon request. The Personal Care Products Council opposed the legislation, arguing it would hurt personal care product manufacturers. Related video: Holiday Inn to get rid of mini-shampoo bottles by 2021

"This avo was about the size of my 12-year-old son's head," mother says.

The only thing extra about the avocado at the Pokini household is the size.The Hawaiian family landed themselves in the Guinness Book of World Records after growing an avocado weighing 5.6 pounds, setting a record for the world's heaviest.The previous record was held by a 5.5-pound avocado, according to Guinness, and was grown by Felicidad Pasalo in Hilo, Hawaii, in January 2018.Juliane Pokini told CNN that the family got the seed from her brother-in-law, Dickie Marciel, who had taken it from his parents' avocado tree in Kailua, Oahu.From flowering to harvest, Pokini said it took roughly 10 months for the avocado to reach its maximum weight."While it was still in the pot it was pulled out twice by our son; we didn't think it would survive but it did," she said. "When we planted it in the ground, we never did anything to it except for some trimming every now and then."Pokini said the process for applying with Guinness took a lot of patience, but so did growing the fruit.After a three-month waiting period, Guinness accepted the Pokinis' application. After that, they had to send evidence of the record they were trying to beat."For us it was having experts and witnesses available at the time of weighing the avocado, along with a certified scale," Pokini said. "We also had to have everyone fill out a witness statement, along with videotaping."Once the evidence was sent in, they waited another three months to hear back."This avo was about the size of my 12-year-old son's head," Pokini told CNN affiliate KGMB.After documenting its size, the family used the massive avocado to make a whole ot of guacamole. They were able to make enough to feed about 20 people — typically 10 avocados are needed to serve that many people.It's not uncommon to find larger-than-life avocados, if you know where to look.In 2018, some of the world's largest avocados weighed just under 4 pounds and were grown in Australia. They are given the name, "Avozillas," because they are about five times bigger than a regular one.

Season's first flu cases confirmed in Maryland
.W
Maryland health officials said the season's first flu cases have been confirmed.

Maryland health officials said the season's first flu cases have been confirmed.The Maryland Department of Health announced Tuesday that there are 11 laboratory-confirmed cases identified since Sept. 1.The majority of the cases so far have been subtyped as influenza A (H3N2), with a few classified as influenza B. The vaccine protects against both influenza A and B, health officials said in a statement."We don't know yet whether flu activity this early indicates a particularly bad season on the horizon," Maryland Health Secretary Robert R. Neall said in a statement. "Still, we can't emphasize strongly enough -- get your flu shot now. Don’t put it off. The vaccine is widely available at grocery stores, pharmacies and local health clinics, in addition to your doctor's office."Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that may lead to serious complications, hospitalization and death. Although most influenza cases are mild and people recover with little to no complications, influenza can pose a serious risk for children younger than 5 years, adults older than 65 years, pregnant women and individuals with compromised immune systems.During last year's influenza season, 3,274 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 82 influenza-associated deaths were reported to the MDH, including four deaths of individuals under the age of 18.The influenza virus spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing, as well as through contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces and objects. Common symptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, coughing and sore throat. Symptoms usually begin one to four days after being exposed."The best way to protect yourself and your family is to get a flu shot. Getting vaccinated every year is important because the strains change over time," Deputy Secretary for Public Health Fran Phillips said in a statement. "Also, keep in mind that it takes about two weeks after being vaccinated before the body's full immune response kicks in."The influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. It is especially important for individuals who are at high risk for influenza-related complications including:Children 6 months through 5 years old;People over 50 years old;Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders;People who are immunocompromised;Women who are or will become pregnant during the flu season;Children and adolescents who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;People who are extremely obese (body mass index more than 40 for adults).If you think you have the flu:Contact your health care provider to help manage symptoms or complicationsGet rest and drink plenty of fluidsCover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughingUse alcohol-based hand sanitizers and wash your hands oftenStay home from work or school to avoid spreading the fluCDC: Prevent seasonal fluMDH FluWatch             BALTIMORE

Police: Woman researched ‘what to do if your husband is upset you are pregnant’ prior to her death
.W
Beau Rothwell is jailed without bond on charges of second-degree murder and evidence tampering in the death of his wife, Jennifer.

A suburban St. Louis woman whose husband is charged in her death had looked up “what to do if your husband is upset you are pregnant" on her cellphone before she went missing last month, according to search warrants. The warrants outline the reasons detectives gave for searching the home of Jennifer and Beau Rothwell near the suburb of Creve Coeur. The couple’s cellphones, email accounts, Facebook accounts and Beau Rothwell’s SUV were also searched.Beau Rothwell, 28, is jailed without bond on charges of second-degree murder and evidence tampering in his wife's death. His lawyer previously declined to comment on the charges.Jennifer Rothwell's body was found about a week after she went missing about 45 miles northwest of her home. Detectives disclosed in warrants that Jennifer Rothwell, who was also 28, had been six weeks pregnant when she died. In the newly released search warrants, investigators say Beau Rothwell called 911 at 9:44 p.m. Nov. 12 to report his wife of four years missing, saying he last saw her that morning as she was leaving for her job as a chemical engineer. He told police that her co-workers told him she didn't show up for work that day and they were concerned. Police found her car parked near her home, with her cellphone inside. Beau Rothwell wouldn't let police search the home, car or cellphone, or take a DNA sample from him, according to investigators. He also requested an attorney, Detectives then searched a trash can placed at the curb of the home Nov. 13. In it, they found various cleaning supplies, including rubber gloves and paper towels, the warrants state. A receipt showed cleaning items had been purchased Nov. 11 from a grocery store.“This purchase was oddly at a time during a major snow event involving dangerous driving conditions, and was also contradictory to Beau Rothwell’s statement that he was home with his wife all night,” an investigator wrote in the documents.Police said they also found signs that violent acts had been committed inside the home. Detectives described an “overwhelming” smell of bleach and other cleaners inside the home as well as several “large areas of red stain” at the base of the basement steps. DNA tests confirmed that the blood found in the home was Jennifer Rothwell’s.There was also damage to drywall in the basement, which had samples of human hair, the warrants state.The blood-stained areas were wet with detergent and had a circulating fan blowing air over the area, and the basement windows were open despite temperatures that were in the 30s.Beau and Jennifer Rothwell received chemical engineering degrees from the University of Missouri-Columbia in 2013. They married in 2015 in St. Louis County.             CREVE COEUR, Mo.

Someone ate a $120,000 banana that an artist had taped to a wall
.W
The artwork featured a banana bought in a grocery store, and a single piece of duct tape.

An artist duct-taped a banana to a wall and priced it at $120,000 last week.The work, by Maurizio Cattelan, was ripe for the picking -- and on Saturday, it was unceremoniously taken off the wall at the Art Basel Miami Beach and eaten by a performance artist, amid a crowd of stunned onlookers, some of whom posted videos of the incident."I really love this installation. It's very delicious," David Datuna wrote on Instagram, alongside a video showing the aftermath of his stunt.As people gathered and filmed the incident, a woman can be seen remonstrating with Datuna before asking for his name.Entitled "Comedian," the artwork comprised a banana bought in a Miami grocery store, and a single piece of duct tape. The gallery behind the sale, Galerie Perrotin, said there were three editions, and that two had already sold for around $120,000.Organizers had previously confirmed to CNN that the banana can be replaced if needed, as the artist's instructions for the work are "intentionally imprecise." But in a statement Sunday, the gallery announced that the installation had been removed altogether amid public safety concerns."Art Basel collaboratively worked with us to station guards and create uniform lines," it read. "However, the installation caused several uncontrollable crowd movements and the placement of the work on our booth compromised the safety of the artwork around us, including that of our neighbors."An Instagram account set up for the artwork also posted a video showing gallery founder Emmanuel Perrotin removing a banana from the wall and eating it himself."Maurizio, it's a good banana, I have to say," he is filmed saying.Prior to the reported sale, Perrotin told CNN the bananas are "a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor," adding that the artist turns mundane objects into "vehicles of both delight and critique."The artists did not provide potential buyers with instructions on what to do when the artwork starts to decompose.According to a press statement from Galerie Perrotin, the artist first came up with the idea a year ago."Back then, Cattelan was thinking of a sculpture that was shaped like a banana," it reads. "Every time he traveled, he brought a banana with him and hung it in his hotel room to find inspiration. He made several models: first in resin, then in bronze and in painted bronze (before) finally coming back to the initial idea of a real banana."Cattelan is known for sculptures that challenge popular culture. One of his artworks -- an 18-carat-gold toilet valued at around $6 million -- made headlines in September when it was ripped out of a wall and stolen from Bleinheim Palace in England.

Maryland State Police are still investigating a fiery crash that killed the president of a grocery store company and a 7-year-old boy.

Maryland State Police are still investigating a fiery crash that killed the president of a grocery store company and a 7-year-old boy. WBAL-TV 11 News is learning more about both victims: Andrew Klein, 65, was someone who understood that basic needs were critical for people, and Tripp Johnson, 7, had a zest for life.The beginning of a small tribute at the intersection of West Ring Factory Road and Route 24 in Bel Air. It honors the accident victims who died: Klein, the president of Klein's ShopRite and Tripp, a second-grader at William Paca/Old Post Road Elementary. Both were passengers in separate cars when a ShopRite tractor-trailer plowed into stopped traffic. Monday's crash also included 11 other vehicles. "Tripp hugged often. He laughed. Most of all, he made our days brighter," said Tammy Bolsey, principal of William Paca/Old Post Road Elementary. Bosley said Tripp was well liked and had a zest for life. Counselors and psychologists are working with grieving students and staff. "We did spend a lot of time with the younger students, where they had an opportunity to talk about all the ways they remember Tripp and celebrate the things they remembered about him most," said Bosler. Klein is being remembered as a unique person, a Harford County philanthropist engaged in all kinds of issues and communities. Those included Baltimore, where his family opened this ShopRite store in 2014, ending a food desert in the Howard Park neighborhood. "It's a huge loss for us and I don't know at this point  what the ramifications will be long-term," said Mary Hastler, CEO of the Harford County Public Library. "He really did touch so many lives and people. I don't think people really understood what he did to change where they lived or where they worked or the library -- or the schools. He was just everywhere."State police said finding the exact cause of the accident will take some time."According to our preliminary investigation, it does not seem that impairment was a factor in this crash," Maryland State Police spokesman Ron Snyder said. "It's an unfortunate confluence of events that ended in tragedy."The boy's mother, Meagan Fullylove, remains in a hospital in serious condition. The truck driver was not injured. Police say they are trying to do a thorough investigation and not rush to any conclusions about the accident.Information on Klein's funeral arrangements can be found here.

A piece of Baltimore culture is on display at a downtown museum and it's bringing back childhood memories for those who grew up there. The pictures depict the lives of arabbers, pulling their horse drawn carts through the streets selling produce.It's told through the lens of a man who grew up in the business."They would get up at the crack of dawn and start. They would buy bushels and bushels of veggies and fruit," said Jackie Copeland, executive director of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum.The pictures on the walls of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum brings back the sights and sounds of a Baltimore culture people remember from childhood."Within one or two images, they're like, 'I remember yelling strawberries or watermelon,'" Copeland said.Roland Freeman's Arabber's Life in Baltimore Streets exhibit is a collection of photographers taken in the 1970s and 1980s. He came from a family of arabbers, African-American men who, since the turn of the century, pull their horse drawn carriages through the streets selling produce."They were able to deliver food to people who can't get food, shut-ins who were sick and where there are no grocery stores. So they serve a purpose," Copeland said.Copeland said in it's heyday, there were more than a hundred arrabers. Now, only a handful remain."There is no other city that has the arrabers still. Although their numbers are dwindling, we're the only city in the country that has them," Copeland said.The exhibit was supposed to close at the end of March, but it's been so popular that it has been extended to the end of April/beginning of May.Freeman, who is now in his 80s, donated more than a hundred pictures, so there will be something new for those to see who have already been to visit."It teaches people what is unique about Baltimore -- one of the things that we need to treasure and preserve," Copeland said.​             BALTIMORE

Residents react to possible closing of Shoppers in Mondawmin Mall
.W
There is worry in communities in Baltimore City and County that Shoppers Food stores could soon be closing.

There is worry in communities in Baltimore City and County that Shoppers Food stores could soon be closing.The Washington Business Journal says that news was revealed in a conference call by the stores' owner earlier this month.If the Shoppers Food at Mondawmin closed, it would devastate the community. The store helps eliminate a food desert that once existed in the area and if it's sold and another chain does not take over, that desert could appear again."Basically, it's convenient because there's no other Shoppers Food shop or place around. Yeah, it would be a hardship," said shopper Ike Lawson."Well, honey, we ain't got too many where we live at anyway, and this is one of my closest areas every other two weeks to go shopping because I live off North Avenue, so we don't really have anything," said another shopper, Peggy Sheldon.According to The Washington Business Journal, during a recent earnings conference call, United Natural Foods Inc., which owns Shoppers, said it hoped to sell off the 36 remaining Baltimore-Washington area stores; 18 of those are in the Baltimore region."That would make people have to go to another store or market further away from here, right, exactly, yes or yeah, they would have to go further," said Shorty Jones.One area that would be hit hardest is the community around Mondawmin which has already seen the exit of Marshalls and Target.  If United Natural does sell off the Shoppers stores, customers tell 11 News they only hope another grocery store will move in. "A lot of people who live in the community can't get to other markets in a reasonable way will have to use these corner stores they overcharge so it would be detrimental to the community, said Charles Turner. United Natural Foods responded to 11 News saying, "There are no immediate plans for any Shoppers stores to close at this time. There is no timetable in place or any further updates."

Police: Another person was caught on camera licking ice cream in a store

"We believe it's a copy cat incident...He did it and he did want to create some notoriety for himself by posting it on Facebook and that's exactly what he did."

Louisiana police say a 36-year-old man was inspired by a viral video of a teenager licking a tub of Blue Bell ice cream to seek his own 15 minutes of fame.Assumption Parish Sheriff's deputies arrested Lenise Martin III on Saturday after receiving a tip from a grocery store in Belle Rose, Commander Lonny Cavalier told CNN.Someone recorded Martin pulling a carton of Blue Bell ice cream from a freezer, opening it, licking the frozen dessert and poking it with his finger before putting it back on the shelf, Cavalier said.Detectives found evidence that Martin posted the video on Facebook, suggesting that he was seeking attention for the alleged misdeed, Cavalier said.Martin is being held on charges of unlawful posting of criminal activity for notoriety and publicity and criminal mischief for allegedly tampering with property -- in this case, the ice cream, Cavalier said.He is in custody until a judge sets bond, Cavalier said. CNN was unable to reach Martin or known relatives under numbers listed for them.Martin showed detectives a receipt for the purchase of Blue Bell Ice Cream, suggesting that he bought the contaminated ice cream, Cavalier said. But the purchase doesn't absolve him of wrongdoing, Cavalier said, "Because at any rate it's a terrible thing to do.""Taking into consideration that he eventually purchased the same container is one thing," Cavalier said."However he puts it on Facebook to gain this notoriety and at the end of the day, it gives other people ideas that are not the best interest of public health," Cavalier said.Based on comments Martin allegedly made to detectives, the sheriff's office believes he was inspired by a video of a juvenile who opened a carton of ice cream at a Texas Walmart, licked it and put it back, Cavalier said."We believe it's a copy cat incident," Cavalier said."He did it and he did want to create some notoriety for himself by posting it on Facebook and that's exactly what he did."

Annapolis police arrested two teenagers after a private security guard was injured Tuesday in the crossfire of a shooting, police said.

Annapolis police arrested two teenagers after a private security guard was injured Tuesday in the crossfire of a shooting, police said.Police said officers were called around 9 p.m. to the 1700 block of Forest Drive on a report of a shooting in the parking lot outside a grocery store. Officers found a security guard with a graze wound to his chest from a bullet, police said. He was taken to a hospital with a non-life-threatening injury, police said."He was grazed by the bullet, it didn't strike him straight-on. So he suffered injuries to his chest," Annapolis Cpl. Amy Miguez said. "This was a man working in uniform. It could have just as easily been a police officer out there, and for no regard to his safety, this young man targeted him and shot him."Police said Nelson Poston, 15, of Annapolis, and Kareem Davis, 17, of Washington, were arrested Wednesday and charged as adults with attempted first-degree murder and other related charges.Police said detectives believe the suspects were together when they encountered a group of males and Poston took out a handgun and shot at them. It is not clear whether Davis or the other group had weapons, police said.Police said Poston and Davis started to flee. When they ran past the security guard, Poston turned in the guard's direction and fired at him, grazing his chest, police said.Police said they have recovered a handgun as the investigation continues."This morning, when we were doing the search warrants, we did three different search warrants, we were able to recover one handgun. It's not clear at this time whether it's the gun that was used in the shooting. We believe there may have been more weapons involved than just the one that Nelson had," Miguez said.Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Chuck Bealefeld at 443-986-5561 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 866-7LOCKUP.

A Maryland company is working to feed people in food deserts by collecting misshaped, oversized and surplus food.

A Maryland company is working to feed people in food deserts by collecting misshaped, oversized and surplus food.Every year, 40 percent of food goes to waste in the United States while 20 percent of Americans lack access to nutritious food to put on their table.The food being sorted in a Jessup warehouse was rejected from packers and wholesalers because of scarring or sizing. Some food was rejected simply because it was misshapen or too large.Hungry Harvest CEO Evan Lutz said other produce come from surplus."It was the rainiest season on record. We have a ton of surplus of tomatoes, zucchini and squash because farmers just simply grew too much and can't find a buyer for them. So we aggregate all of the produce in our warehouse in Jessup, Maryland, and deliver it to customers once a week," Lutz said.Since 2014, Hungry Harvest has rescued 9 million pounds of food and donated 800,000 pounds.Lutz invited U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen to see the operation and put together a Hungry Harvest box.Lutz sells his produce at reduced rates in Baltimore City's food deserts. People are able to buy the food with SNAP benefit cards, but Lutz hopes Van Hollen can help him bring Hungry Harvest to more people through a pilot program so people can receive SNAP benefits online."We order everything online, and I find it ridiculous that most vulnerable people in our society who want healthy food cannot order it online," Lutz said."That would both ensure greater convenience and make sure people who need food and greater nutrition are more easily getting it," Van Hollen said.For now, every Hungry Harvest box ordered closes a gap in food access.

Dear polar bears: Welcome home to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore
.W
The two newest arrivals at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore are settling into their home at the Polar Bear Watch.

The two newest arrivals at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore are settling into their home at the Polar Bear Watch.Despite being half-sisters, they've actually never met before, so there's some getting-to-know-you activities that have to happen over the next couple of weeks.People can't see the new polar bears yet because they're in quarantine getting used to their environment. Even though they are only almost 2 years old, the folks at the zoo said they're anything but little."Right now, they are between 380 and 440 pounds," assistant general curator Margaret Innes said.The pair, Neva and Amelia Gray, still have quite a bit of growing to do as the new kids on the block. They were born at the Columbus Zoo. For now, they're living their lives in Baltimore behind the scenes."I think the most fun thing about watching the bears is going to be seeing them interact with all the features that they're not familiar with. They will be exploring. They'll be very active, whereas older bears you might expect to be a little bit more sedentary," Innes said.Neva and Amelia Gray replace a zoo favorite: Anoki, 21, who left last month for a zoo in Rochester.The Polar Bear Watch became "baby watch" for a time with hopes of mating the famous Magnet, the zoo's lone male bear, with first Alaska, who died in 2013, and then Anoki. Magnet died in 2015.So are there eventual breeding plans for these two?"We will have to see as they get a little bit older and we take a look at the North American population; we will have to determine if they are going to stay here or there might be other  plans for us with bears at the Polar Bear Watch," Innes said.The bears are off exhibit until further notice, and then depending on how fast they start to get along will dictate when visitors will be able to see them, but look for sometime in November at the zoo.

A long-awaited study by the Maryland Stadium Authority recommends tearing down Pimlico Race Course and rebuilding a new one.

A long-awaited study by the Maryland Stadium Authority recommends tearing down Pimlico Race Course and rebuilding a new one.Pimlico Race Course Study phase twoPimlico Race Course Study phase two appendicesPimlico Race Course Study websiteIn addition to a new track, the proposal calls for retail, a grocery store, a hotel and townhouses -- and the price tag is hefty, at $423.7 million, but the return could be tremendous. Mayor Catherine Pugh said the new amenities would bring in more than $800 million in public and private investments.Pugh wholeheartedly endorses the redevelopment plan, saying in a statement, "MSA's proposal for Pimlico will help transform Park Heights, create thousands of jobs for residents and will result in more than $800 million in public and private investments."There was mixed reaction from residents."Keep the track, and they could build another grocery store for this neighborhood," said Verna Campbell, of Park Heights."I live around here. I'm not really a fan of that. A lot of people come around here during the Preakness and leave their trash and stuff like that," said Mike Davis, of Park Heights.Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said the $423.7 million price tag will not be all government spending."What the study says is, 'Why don't you look at private sector participation?' I see this as a collaboration between the public and private side," Franchot said.The MSA's plan calls for a plaza to serve the community year-round, not just during Preakness. The venue would include concerts, performing arts, festivals and open-air markets. It recommends building a multi-use clubhouse that would be open 51 weeks a year. It would offer social and civic events and after-school and summer programs.The Stronach Group, which owns Pimlico and Laurel race courses, issued a statement saying they want lawmakers to tackle "not only the financial requirements for a modern stadium that can host the Preakness Stakes, but how to best support the needs of the thoroughbred industry as a whole, sustainable, year-round horse-racing and training, an enhanced guest experience and greater fan engagement in Maryland."Pimlico workers hope they can keep their jobs."From my position, it's good because they can give more jobs there. I agree with that," said Fransico Magana, a Pimlico worker.A new race track might sound familiar to those who recall a 2004 plan to build a track and casino downtown at a cost of $415 million. The 180-acre site would have been bordered by Washington Boulevard and Interstate 95. The state would have bought the land, and private developers would have built the track, a high-end grandstand, restaurants and other amenities. The proposal, pitched by a Republican governor, didn't go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled State House.The MSA study recommends the city, the state, the Maryland Jockey Club and track owners enter into formal negotiations about the next steps.

Ravens, Maryland Food Bank team up to feed hungry during holidays
.W
Every day, the Maryland Food Bank distributes 102,000 meals to children and families who are hungry.

One in nine Marylanders don't know where their next meal is coming from, so in an effort to make them more comfortable during the holidays, the Baltimore Ravens have teamed up with the Maryland Food Bank to provide meals. Every day, the Maryland Food Bank distributes 102,000 meals to children and families who are hungry.It's a huge operation. Food comes in daily from partner organizations and donors. That food needs to get sorted so it can go out to the more than 1,000 partners that make sure people in 21 counties and Baltimore City get what they need.On Tuesday, members of the Ravens community team volunteered their time. "Being a large sports entity, we have an amazing platform, an elevated platform, to raise awareness about whatever the issue is, and food insecurities is one of those issues. I think we help motivate people to give back," Keenan Harrell, community relations coordinator for the Ravens.The Ravens kicked off the 23rd annual Ravens Family Food and Funds Drive for the month of November. They are asking people to donate money when they check out at a local Safeway grocery store or to bring canned goods and cash to the Ravens game this Sunday against the Bengals."We will have Maryland Food Bank volunteers, Safeway volunteers, at every gate with buckets to collect. We will have bins at each gate as well so bring whatever you've got," Harrell said.Members of the Baltimore Ravens All Community Team was at the Maryland Food Bank kitchen vacuum sealing prepared food that will later be frozen.The prepared meals prevent food from going to waste. "Financial donors are becoming more and more important because we, an organization our size, has tremendous buying power, so that dollar you spent at a retailer, (we) can actually buy three times as much you can buy from a retailer," said Carmen Del Guercia, president and CEO of the Maryland Food Bank. That's more food for families, as no one should ever have to be hungry.​             BALTIMORE

Good Samaritan rescues puppy found near dumpster battered, bleeding, officials say

BARCS treats 'Hootie' for multiple injuries

A nearly 5-week-old puppy is recovering from injuries after she was found near a dumpster in Baltimore, officials with the Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter said.On the morning of Oct. 12, a good Samaritan heard a little noise coming from near a dumpster at the intersection of Liberty Heights and Garrison and found Hootie alone, scared and bleeding from her head, BARCS officials said.Hootie was scooped up and brought to BARCS, where they treated her injuries. Through X-rays, officials said they saw that Hootie had three fractures to her head: her eye, her skull and her jaw. The injuries were caused by a large bite wound, officials said."We sent her to the emergency room. X-rays revealed that she has three fractures in her head, and for being so small, that's certainly not good," said Bailey Deacon, of BARCS.Because of Hootie's young age, she couldn't have her jaw wired shut, and her pain must be managed through medications and very careful care, officials said. She has a long road of recovery ahead of her.BARCS said it is unclear if Hootie was placed in the area near the dumpster or walked from somewhere else, but she was a public dropoff at their facility.Those at BARCS, who have seen it all when it comes to animal abuse, said the good thing in this case is that someone did the right thing, and saved a life."It was a concerned, good citizen who took the time out of their busy morning to help a puppy and drive it all the way down here to BARCS," Deacon said.All cases of abuse, neglect and abandonment are open investigations by Animal Control, BARCS officials said.As far as Hootie's recovery, it will be touch-and-go with her fractures, and because it appears she was bitten, she needs to be quarantined for four months before she can be adopted.There is a waiting list to adopt Hootie, but BARCS is still accepting applications. Anyone who would like to send a donation to help care for animals in BARCS' care can contribute here.             BALTIMORE

Officer fires at SUV in Rosedale after pursuit, police say
.W
A police pursuit in Rosedale ended when an officer fired at the suspect vehicle, Baltimore County police said.

A police pursuit in Rosedale ended Tuesday morning when an officer fired at the suspect vehicle, Baltimore County police said.Police said officers were called around 5 a.m. to a Walgreens in the 9600 block of Harford Road for a report of a theft. The caller stated that a man took items from the store and fled in a blue Chevrolet Tahoe, police said.Police said officers saw an SUV with stolen license plates leaving the location. They tried to stop the SUV, but the driver fled, police said.Police said the SUV collided with a police car on Philadelphia Road near 65th Street.The pursuit lasted about 15 minutes, ultimately leading to the 7400 block of Pulaski Highway, where there was a second collision. The officer got out of his car and approached the SUV. Police said the driver ignored several commands from the officer to get out of the SUV.The driver failed to stop and drove in the direction of officers, police said."The car starts to come back onto Pulaski Highway, where an officer is, headed directly in the direction of that officer. The car is coming at the officer. At this point, in fear of his life, he fired several times at this car," Baltimore County police Cpl. Shawn Vinson said."We were sitting here at 5 this morning and we heard a crash, and we looked around the corner and there were gunshots. I heard the gunshots," a witness said.The Baltimore County State's Attorney's Office showed to the media the body camera video of the shooting. In the video, the SUV is seen colliding with the police car twice. The officer got out of his car and yelled, "Stop the car, stop the car." The officer fired as many as two shots as the SUV pulled out and as many as nine shot as the SUV fled.  WBAL-TV 11 News I-Team lead investigative reporter Jayne Miller said it was not crystal clear that the SUV was aimed directly at the officer.The vehicle ended up about a quarter of a mile away near North Point Road, police said. The driver was not injured. A male passenger suffered a gunshot wound to his arm. He was being treated at a hospital and is expected to survive his injuries. The names of both suspects are not being released, pending charges, police said.Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger did not allow recording of the body worn video and did not release it publicly.Prosecutors said no conclusions have been reached and that the investigation continues.The officer who fired the shots is the same officer who, while off duty,  fatally shot a shoplifting suspect outside a Catonsville grocery store last year,  Police Officer 1st Class McCain. Prosecutors ruled the Catonsville shooting justified. He was also involved in a combat shooting in 2006 that did not result in a fatality, police said.

The road reopened around 11:30 a.m. A portion of Philadelphia Road was also closed.Check traffic conditions hereStay with WBALTV.com and 11 News for more on this developing story.

Strangers' suspicions rankle parents of mixed-race kids

Parents whose children have a different complexion say they regularly face suspicion and the assumption that they must be watching someone else's kids.

Amberkatherine DeCory carried photos of her daughter's birth certificate in her diaper bag in case she had to prove that the lighter-skinned girl was really hers. Cydnee Rafferty gives her husband a letter explaining that he has permission to travel with their 5-year-old biracial daughter.Families like theirs were not surprised when they heard that Cindy McCain had reported a woman to police for possible human trafficking because the widow of Sen. John McCain saw her at the airport with a toddler of a different ethnicity. Officers investigated and found no evidence of wrongdoing.Parents whose children have a different complexion say they regularly face suspicion and the assumption that they must be watching someone else's kids."This is a problem that, to be frank, well-meaning white people get themselves into," said Rafferty, who is African-American and whose husband is white. "They think, 'If it doesn't make sense to me it must not be right.'"After McCain's report, Rafferty posted to Twitter a selfie of her with her two children, ages 5 and 5 months."I know they don't look like me, but I assure you, I grew them in my belly," Rafferty wrote to McCain.Earlier this month, McCain claimed on Phoenix radio station KTAR that the woman was waiting for a man who bought the child to get off a plane and that her Jan. 30 report to police had stopped the trafficking. She urged people to speak up if they see anything odd."I came in from a trip I'd been on," McCain said. "I spotted — it looked odd — it was a woman of a different ethnicity than the child, this little toddler she had. Something didn't click with me. I tell people 'trust your gut.'"She said she spoke about her suspicions with police "and they went over and questioned her. And, by God, she was trafficking that kid."Phoenix Police Sgt. Armando Carbajal confirmed that McCain requested a welfare check on a child at the airport, but said officers found "no evidence of criminal conduct or child endangerment."McCain has declined interview requests and has not said if anything besides the difference in ethnicity led her to suspect trafficking. A spokesman for the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University said McCain was "only thinking about the possible ramifications of a criminal act, not the ethnicity of the possible trafficker."After police debunked her claim, McCain reiterated the importance of speaking up when something looks wrong."I apologize if anything else I have said on this matter distracts from 'if you see something, say something,'" she wrote on Twitter.Rafferty, a 38-year-old New Yorker, was surprised that McCain, who adopted a daughter from Bangladesh, would make the same something's-not-right assumption that mixed-race families grapple with constantly. It's not always summoning the police. Other, more common ways of calling out the differences sting too.For Rafferty, the questions are frustrating and offensive: "Whose baby is that?" from a woman in the grocery store. "Where's her beautiful golden skin and curly hair?" from a client at the office, who had a distinct idea of how a biracial child should look. "You're the ...?" followed by a pause for her to fill in the blank with "mom."And if she pushes a stroller on Manhattan's Upper West Side, everyone assumes she's the nanny. At the park, neither the mothers nor the caregivers know whether to embrace her in their camp.DeCory, a 38-year-old police officer outside Minneapolis who has African-American and Native American ancestry, said the anxiety between mom and baby is a constant challenge for mixed-race families that isn't talked about enough.She recalls being haunted by a terrifying vision she couldn't shake: Someone would question whether she was truly the mother of her daughter, and she wouldn't be able to prove it. She'd imagine her daughter, Mila, being placed between her and a white woman while someone in authority watched to see which way she crawled.Until her daughter could speak, DeCory carried her birth certificate and even a photo of her giving birth, just in case she had to prove that her light-haired, blue-eyed child was truly her own. As Mila has gotten older, her hair has darkened. She's now 11.DeCory didn't face the same anxieties with her other two children, who have darker skin closer to her own."I would get anxiety going out with her in public," DeCory said. "I was very reluctant to breastfeed her in public or do anything that would draw attention to me."
