Second Mount Airy nursing home resident dies from coronavirus; 77 test positive

A nursing home in Carroll County and a retirement community in Baltimore County are both impacted by the coronavirus.

A nursing home in Carroll County and a retirement community in Baltimore County are both impacted by the coronavirus.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||A coronavirus outbreak at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy led to the death of two men, one in his 90s and another over 80, both of whom had underlying medical issues. Carroll County health officials reported Monday an additional 11 positive coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases at the facility to 77. Eighteen of the facility's 95 residents tested negative. Sixteen patients have been hospitalized."But there are probably also folks who are afraid and may not be reporting to work because they're calling in and saying or self-reporting that they're sick because they're afraid to be in the facility," Carroll County Health Officer Ed Singer said Sunday.Carroll County health officials said the National Guard is deploying a medic unit to the facility to help assess all residents' conditions and to determine which residents need a higher level of care.Meanwhile, no outsiders are allowed to enter the senior living complex Oak Crest Village in Parkville unless they are essential visitors. Anyone given permission to enter must undergo a thorough screening. The ban on visitors and screenings are out of an abundance of caution.In a statement to 11 News, Erickson Living spokesman Dan Dunne wrote: "We have learned that one resident has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). At this time, we have no other reported cases among residents or employees but are closely monitoring those who live and work at our community so we can take immediate action if needed. The impacted resident is receiving appropriate care and treatment. Those who live and work on campus have been informed of this situation, and we are proceeding with the utmost caution."Sinai Hospital's infectious diseases director, Dr. Kjell Wiberg, talked with 11 News about the spread of the virus in a nursing home setting."Generally, (when) you're talking nursing home and assisted living (facilities), they are confined environments, so people generally spend time closer together than they would have done in their own home. So that's, I think, one of the reasons there are higher risks of getting (an) infection in that environment," Wiberg said.Wiberg is also taking some precautions, including cutting his outpatient visits by about 85%, and he's relying more on telemedicine.

Trump says quarantine of some states will not be necessary
.W
Earlier, President Trump had floated the idea of quarantining three states to counter the spread of COVID-19.

President Donald Trump has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a "strong travel advisory" to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.The move comes, he said on Twitter, after consulting with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, who will administer the plan "in consultation with the Federal Government."Trump said a quarantine, the idea of which he had floated earlier, "will not be necessary."Trump had said earlier in the day that he was considering a short-term quarantine of "hot spots" in parts of the tri-state area -- New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- where cases of coronavirus continue to rise."We're thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot. ... We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut," he told reporters as he departed the White House for Norfolk Naval Station to send off a Navy hospital ship to New York.Trump's suggestion comes after the United States this week became the epicenter of the global pandemic, with at least 111,000 reported Covid-19 cases across the country, and more than 52,000 of them in New York state alone. Officials forecast that the apex of the pandemic there is still 14 to 21 days away. But overwhelmed hospitals, in New York as well as across the US, working to treat coronavirus patients and curb the spread of the virus are facing a shortage of supplies and ventilators, a key piece of equipment."I'd rather not do it, but we may need it," said the president, who later tweeted that "decision will be made, one way or another, shortly." New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that he spoke with Trump on Saturday morning, but that the two had not discussed a quarantine."I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable," the Democratic governor said during in a news conference in Albany. "And from a medical point view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing.""But I can tell you, I don't even like the sound of it," he added.             CNN

It's apparently not the time to be counting carbs.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates ||H&S Bakery is ramping up production and distribution of its bread products -- and hiring more than 50 new workers -- to keep the shelves stocked at supermarkets across Greater Baltimore.Bread, along with milk, eggs, toilet paper and other typical snow day staples, have been disappearing from supermarkets as people hole up in their homes to steer clear of the spread of COVID-19.Maryland's restaurants and bars aren't open, except for carryout and delivery in some cases, so many people find themselves having to cook at home.Read the full story from our partners at the Baltimore Business Journal             BALTIMORE

Even for those of us with the happiest and most stable marriages, social distancing to combat the spread of coronavirus provides some serious challenges to our respective unions.

Even for those of us with the happiest and most stable marriages, social distancing to combat the spread of coronavirus provides some serious challenges to our respective unions.We're confined to small spaces with our significant others with little to no reprieve. We've got to balance work life and personal life, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Video above: 4 strategies to keep your cool during family quarantineThrow young kids (or even teens) into the mix and it can be a recipe for disaster — or, even worse, divorce.CNN spoke with several Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, clinical psychologists and married people about how to make sure your union isn't a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic.Communicate, communicate, communicateThe secret to any healthy relationship is communication.It's true under normal circumstances and in the time of coronavirus. For some, this might mean periodic huddles to deliver updates on what's coming next. For others, it could be a daily check-in that rates how each partner feels physically and internally.Michele Weiner-Davis, a marriage and family therapist in Boulder, Colorado, said it doesn't matter as much how couples communicate during a coronavirus shelter-in-place, but simply that they try to do so."The biggest challenges I've faced so far are the cases in which both spouses are looking at what's going on with different lenses — one person thinks the sky is falling and the other thinks people are making a big deal about it," said Weiner-Davis, who also has a busy teletherapy practice."When people have different perspectives, they have different ideas of what needs to be done, and the only way to work around that is to communicate."Embrace spaceMost spouses spend the bulk of every day apart — at least one partner leaves the house to go to work. Now, however, due to companies ordering employees to work from home and government-mandated lockdowns, both partners are required to spend almost all their time under the same roof.Particularly for couples who live in smaller homes, this scenario can make it feel like neither partner has much (or any) personal space.For this reason, many experts suggest acknowledging the importance of alone time. Alev Ates-Barlas, an LMFT in upstate New York, said she tries to teach members of a couple to identify whether they are individuals who need a partner to engage them in order to regulate their own emotions, or individuals who find comfort in regulating on their own."It is important that couples know where you fall in these two categories so that you don't end up assuming your need for regulation is actually your partner's need," she said."If you know your partner is an auto-regulator, then you shouldn't pursue them or engage them," Ates-Barlas said. "Once you regulate yourself, engaging in reflective listening can be a good way to eliminate causes for friction and use that as an opportunity for greater understanding and learning about one another."Put differently, Ates-Barlas said the best way to get through a tense situation with your partner during the next few weeks might be to put on headphones and meditate, or sit quietly in a corner.Sometimes, she said, "all you need is a quiet  of your house for five minutes."Related video: This 14-day plan will help you manage coronavirus stressKeep it lightIn the days following government pleas to engage in social distancing, you might have seen a Tweet from writer and editor Molly Tolsky suggesting that partners suddenly forced to work from home together should create an imaginary co-worker on which to blame disagreements."Pro-tip for couples suddenly working from home together," tweeted Tolsky. "Get yourselves an imaginary coworker to blame things on. In our apartment, Cheryl keeps leaving her dirty water cups all over the place and we really don't know what to do about her."Alexandra Fondren, a public relations professional in Northern California, took the advice to heart.Immediately, she and her husband started scapegoating "Cheryl" for all the things one of them did to annoy the other."I never realized Cheryl was such a chocoholic," Fondren wrote in a recent email, her tongue firmly planted in her cheek. "I've heard it's an easy affliction to hide, but the empty wrappers that are littered throughout the 'office' are illuminating, mainly because none of their contents were once offered to her co-workers."Other partners have found solace in sharing stories of work-related video conferencing gone wrong. Some have even embraced #CovidConfessions, a Friday night social media phenomenon through which people share truths about their lives they'd kept secret until the pandemic.Establish routinesNobody is quite familiar with the "new normal" of social distancing yet, and with news about the pandemic changing rapidly, every day brings with it a new reality.Amid this constant tumult, Lee Miller, a marriage and family therapist in West Los Angeles, said it's wise to create new routines to give life meaning and purpose beyond the mundane. Specifically, Miller said to assign roles for each day: who cooks, who cleans, who answers the phone, and so on."This is not even close to a typical situation, which means there are a number of different roles both partners are going to have to play while they're working through the current reality," she said.  "It's critically important to schedule time to sit down and talk about what your expectations are of each other during this time."In New York City, Carrie Ingoglia and her husband Ron Richards have devised a winning strategy to balance working at home in a 576-square-foot apartment and parenting 15-month-old twins.Richards tries to schedule work calls when the babies are likely to be napping. Ingoglia takes them for walks when Richards needs to focus. Both partners stop working completely during baby mealtimes. The grownups also regularly go out of their way to give each other positive encouragement."This isn't to say we don't bicker, because we do," said Ingoglia, a creative director. "But we know each other well enough to know a bickering moment is not a reflection of our commitment."Get therapyAll this advice is a good start. For more comprehensive assistance in dealing with difficult and potentially sensitive situations, it's always a good idea to seek a new relationship with a trained therapist.Holly Daniels, managing director of clinical affairs for the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, said regular therapy can help people work through even the most intense anxiety."Just having someone to talk to, someone who can help you work through some of these difficult issues, is invaluable," said Daniels, a therapist with a private practice in Los Angeles. "Now more than ever, therapists are becoming indispensable for giving people the tools they need to get through any situation."Thankfully, today it's easier than ever to connect with a therapist.As of March 17, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), said it would not impose penalties against covered providers for noncompliance with the HIPAA rules that relate to provision of telehealth services during this time.That means that a provider who needs to provide telehealth services to their patients during this time may use platforms that would otherwise not be HIPAA-compliant, such as Zoom, FaceTime or Skype. Many state governments made similar decrees.Focus on the little thingsIt's easy to become overwhelmed with existential dread in the face of this pandemic, which changes daily.This panicked state only further complicates your relationship with your partner. Instead of allowing yourself to be triggered, take a deep breath and focus on the little things — especially those you can appreciate with your spouse.Rob Bhatt, a writer in Seattle, says he and his wife, a mental health counselor, have done just this, embracing the extra time they get to spend together by living in a region that issued shelter-in-place orders earlier this month."We used to dine out more frequently; once this thing started, I have been making pizza from scratch," Bhatt said. "We used to watch the news over dinner, but now we turn off the TV and just talk."Bhatt continued: "Most of the time we just have these moments of gratitude for some very basic things we get to do together, and we hope that we'll all be able to get through this horrible thing sooner rather than later."Daniels, the therapist, added that sometimes even the simplest gestures can set the tone."Simply taking the time to stop, look at your partner and tell them, 'Thank you,' can make a huge difference," she said.If you feel unsafeOf course, there's another aspect to being stuck in the house with a spouse — one that can be gravely serious depending on the situation.If you have been a victim of domestic violence, no lockdown or quarantine is more important than your health.Police and other emergency response services are operating as normal, and if you are worried about personal safety be sure to call authorities immediately. The domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-7233, or go to The Hotline.

Residents in several Baltimore neighborhoods came up with a way to connect Tuesday night, even while practicing social distancing.

Residents in several Baltimore neighborhoods came up with a way to connect Tuesday night, even while practicing social distancing.The plan spread on Facebook neighborhood pages over the past day or so.The idea was to get on rooftops and have a good time, as a show of unity.Call it an isolation distraction or just a fun way to party at a distance, some residents in Patterson Park, Upper Fells Point and Canton came up with a way to share some love with their neighbors at the same time, but on their separate rooftops. "This is a good kind of escape from all the negative that's going on and bringing it back to the positive," said organizer Brittany North.North said she got the idea when she saw video of people on lockdown in Italy because of the coronavirus outbreak, gathering at windows and terraces every night -- singing and playing instruments. So she called on neighbors to get on their rooftops and stoops, still at a social distance but having fun and playing some music. "Because Baltimore has a lot of heart, I think it just represents how strong and connected we are, and even if we can't be around each other physically, we can at least from afar," North said.  "Without a moment to pause and be outside and be in the community and be surrounded by neighbors, we're all going to go a little crazy," said resident Abby Hopper. North picked the song "Dance My Pain Away," and although it got too chilly for many to stay out long, it's possible it will be the first of many. "A lot of people liked the idea of it. Longer term, the concept rings true to doing something together to be connected as a neighborhood, despite not being together physically," said Patrick Shea.Residents have also come up with what they're calling a "Virtual tip jar" to help out people in the service industry who aren't working right now.You can find a link to financially support workers here.

Department of Agriculture issues spotted laternfly quarantine for Cecil, Harford counties
.W
The Maryland Department of Agriculture issued a spotted lanternfly quarantine Monday for all of Cecil and Harford counties.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture issued a spotted lanternfly quarantine Monday for all of Cecil and Harford counties. The quarantine is effective immediately and will restrict the movement of regulated articles within the quarantine zone that contain the spotted lanternfly in any of its life stages, including egg masses, nymphs and adults, officials said.According to officials, examples of "regulated articles" include landscaping, remodeling or construction waste; packing materials like wood boxes or crates; plants and plant parts; vehicles; and other outdoor items.The quarantine has been issued in an effort to control the spread of this invasive insect to other parts of the state, officials said.Following a 2019 survey season from the department, Cecil and Harford counties were found to have established populations of spotted lanternfly. Businesses, municipalities and government agencies that require the movement of any regulated item within or from the quarantine zone must have a permits, officials said. A permit can be obtained by taking a free online training course through PennState Extension. Upon completion of the course and an online exam, individuals will receive a permit.Officials said all spotted lanternfly permits for Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware are transferable and valid throughout the region — meaning a permit from any of these states can be used in Maryland. Maryland is currently in the process of developing its own training and permitting system for spotted lanternfly.Residents living within the quarantine zone are encouraged to be vigilant in containing the spread of spotted lanternfly. The spotted lanternfly poses a major threat to the region’s agricultural industries as it feeds on over 70 different types of plants and crops, including grapes, hops, apples, peaches, oak, pine and others. Originally from Asia, the spotted lanternfly is nonnative to the U.S., and was first detected in Berks County, Pennsylvania in the fall of 2014. As a known hitchhiker, the spotted lanternfly has spread to 14 counties within Pennsylvania, and also has confirmed populations in Delaware, Virginia, and New Jersey.A map of the quarantine zone can be viewed here.If you suspect you have found a spotted lanternfly, snap a picture of it, collect it, put it in a plastic bag, freeze it, and report it to the Maryland Department of Agriculture at DontBug.MD@maryland.gov. Dead samples from any life stage can be sent to the Maryland Department of Agriculture Plant Protection and Weed Management Program at 50 Harry S. Truman Parkway, Annapolis, MD 21401.More information about the spotted lanternfly can be found on the department’s website. For questions related to the quarantine, permitting, or treatment, please contact that Plant Protection and Weed Management Program at 410-841-5920.             BALTIMORE

Due to growing concerns of the spread of the coronavirus, Morgan State University announced Thursday the suspension of all study abroad programs and international student travel for the remainder of the spring and summer. The university said the decision was made to reduce the risk of infection to the students.  || Maryland Health Department coronavirus information ||“The safety of our students is the most important thing, above all else. At present, the risk of contracting COVID-19 during international travel is not fully known, so we have taken the most prudent action possible,” said MSU President David Wilson. “We understand that this decision will be disappointing, especially given the university’s continuous support of global scholarship and discovery, but it was one that had to be made in light of the circumstances.”Morgan also initiated its Pandemic Disease Preparation Plan, which was updated to address the coronavirus.The plan is focused on several key areas such as planning and coordination; continuity of student learning and operations; infection control policies and procedures; and communications.

Coronavirus cases closes NCAA basketball viewing, cancels visiting team hotel stay

“I made it very clear to the hotel that it’s discrimination,” Yeshiva coach Elliot Steinmetz said.

Fans will be forced to watch the first two rounds of the NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Championship from behind a screen this weekend, following an announcement from Johns Hopkins University that it will close it's arena to spectators following three confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland."In light of Maryland's recently confirmed cases of COVID-19, and based on CDC guidance for large gatherings, we have determined that it is prudent to hold this tournament without spectators," the university wrote on its website.Also, the basketball coach of visiting team Yeshiva University told the Associated Press that their hotel stay had been canceled after a student at the Orthodox Jewish university tested positive for the virus.The Double Tree Hotel in Pikesville canceled the teams reservation, forcing them to books rooms in an alternate hotel.The Pikesville Double Tree Hotel is independently owned. Officials for the location said in a statement that the team was relocated to another hotel at no additional charge.“I made it very clear to the hotel that it’s discrimination,” Yeshiva coach Elliot Steinmetz said. "I basically said to them: ‘Do you have a checkbox on your website that says that you’ve been in an area with suspected coronavirus?’ And they said no. So I said: ‘Is it just for the guests of Yeshiva University?’ And they said yes. I told them that that’s called discrimination.”In response to the allegations of discrimination, the hotel released a statement, saying, "The DoubleTree by Hilton Baltimore North – Pikesville is aware that there has been an allegation of discrimination around this incident, presumably due to Yeshiva University’s majority Jewish population. This allegation is false and without any merit or basis. Our hotel maintains a strict non-discrimination policy and honors and welcomes people of all faiths regardless of religious affiliation. In fact, a significant portion of the hotel ownership is held by individuals of the Jewish faith. The sole consideration for the relocation was the safety and well-being of our guests and employees."The games will be streamed live on HopTV.

Not only is the coronavirus giving the national economy a headache, it seems it is now starting to take its toll on the local economy.

Not only is the coronavirus giving the national economy a headache, it seems it is now starting to take its toll on the local economy.WBAL-TV 11 News saw empty shelves in stores such as Target, as people stocked up on necessary items. This comes as airlines, the cruise industry and hotels see more cancellations."They’re not as bad as I thought, but it certainly looks like people are stocking up for supplies," said customer Jason Sharp. || Maryland Health Department coronavirus information || Just head to any big-box grocery store or drugstore these days, and you'll be hard-pressed to find simple items like hand sanitizer or even toilet paper."Empty a few soaps and just empty. A lot of stuff is gone," said customer Judy Hopson. It seems growing concerns over the coronavirus, after the announcement of three confirmed cases in Montgomery County, have people trying to stock up for what may be down the road."I think people are going a little bit overboard. It’s just like the flu. You know, it will pass, too," said customer Alane Foltz. While stores are struggling to keep things stocked, Royal Caribbean, which cruises out of Baltimore, announced a new policy letting people cancel up to 48 hours before their cruise, giving credit good through 2021.Major airlines at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport are reporting increased numbers of cancellations.The DoubleTree Hotel in Pikesville relocated reservations for the Yeshiva University men's basketball team, playing in the Division III tournament NCAA at Johns Hopkins University, after a student at the university's New York campus came down with the coronavirus. Yeshiva University later played in its tournament game on the Johns Hopkins University campus in front of no fans, a decision Johns Hopkins school officials say was out of precaution, and part of the CDC's guidelines for large gatherings.“The DoubleTree by Hilton Baltimore North – Pikesville today relocated reservations from Yeshiva University to another hotel, at no additional expense to the group.  We value each and every one of our guests, and safety is an utmost and top priority.  For the safety of our guests and employees, the management of the property followed the precautionary measures set by Yeshiva University, that has recently cancelled classes, as well as scheduled events, through Tuesday, March 10th.""The DoubleTree by Hilton Baltimore North – Pikesville is aware that there has been an allegation of discrimination around this incident, presumably due to Yeshiva University’s majority Jewish population. This allegation is false and without any merit or basis. Our hotel maintains a strict non-discrimination policy and honors and welcomes people of all faiths regardless of religious affiliation. In fact, a significant portion of the hotel ownership is held by individuals of the Jewish faith. The sole consideration for the relocation was the safety and well-being of our guests and employees.""While we regret the inconvenience that this may have caused Yeshiva University, we are pleased that our staff moved diligently to assist the group in securing alternative accommodations. We have only the greatest respect and admiration for Yeshiva University and hope that we will be given the opportunity to provide them with accommodations at our hotel in the future.” "Oh, I think this is going to have a massive impact, and I think the chances of an economic recession now are quite high," said economist Anirban Basu, of Sage Policy Group. Basu told 11 News as more cases of the coronavirus pop up, consumers will spend much less even on simple things such as eating out."Restaurants are seeing fewer people coming in. People are sheltering in. That’s just not good for business. Might be good for Netflix and viewership there, but it’s not good for the broader economy," Basu said.Basu told 11 News if a vaccine can be found or if researchers can find some sort of treatment, something like that could turn things around very quickly.

BWI-Marshall carrier: Coronavirus begins to affect air travel
.W
According to a major carrier out of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, coronavirus is starting to affect air travel in a negative way, with people canceling trips or just choosing not to fly at all.

According to a major carrier out of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, coronavirus is starting to affect air travel in a negative way, with people canceling trips or just choosing not to fly at all."You hear it on the news. I always wash my hands a lot and keep clean," said traveler Bob Pollokoff.Travelers at BWI-Marshall Thursday were cautious, but not too concerned about flying with coronavirus cases increasing around the country."The guidance says to wash your hands repeatedly and not touch your face and eyes and things like that, and I think it's pretty simple to follow. I'm not terribly concerned, (I'll) keep an eye on it, but I don't think it's anything to be worried about right now," said traveler Dylan Foster. || Maryland Health Department coronavirus information ||But it does appear, at least according to the latest SEC filing by Southwest Airlines, the dominant carrier at BWI-Marshall, that fears of traveling by air may be growing.While the first two months of 2020 were on par, the report said in part, "In recent days, the Company has experienced a significant decline in Customer demand, as well as an increase in trip cancellations, which is assumed to be attributable to concerns relating to reported cases of COVID-19.""There's definitely a concern and I think that since people are concerned, they should make sure that the first thing that they do is consult the CDC, that's definitely your authority and if you do have a travel advisor that you're working with, reach out to your travel advisor they're going to make sure that but you're covered," said travel advisor Dilworth Daley, of Daley Destinations.Daley, who books trips around the world, said he is starting to get more calls from concerned clients with upcoming trips.He said now more than ever, travel insurance, which is cheap, is key."In most cases, you may just lose the cost of the travel insurance because it's usually (that) I cancel for any reason, and of course the airlines themselves are going to be very minimal with penalties, so it's always your best interest to get travel insurance," Daley said.So far, Southwest has not canceled any of its domestic or international routes, and said it is taking extra precautions to keep its planes as clean as possible.

There are calls for city and state officials to do more to protect the elderly, poor and homeless in Baltimore from the coronavirus.Just a few hours ago, members of the People's Power Assembly gathered outside of City Hall with a long list of demands of city and state officials.The group's demands focus on the coronavirus, which has already prompted a state of emergency in Maryland. In the group's proposal, it outlines 16 points it wants authorities to address when it comes to protecting the city's most vulnerable, like the elderly, poor and homeless, from COVID-19.One of the points calls for full paid sick and child care leave for all low-wage workers impacted by the illness. The group is also calling for Baltimore City schools' students to get lunches delivered at home in case of any school closures prompted by the virus."What we have to understand is that what we are encountering, we have not come together as a community. Our elected officials have not brought us together and, I can't thank the group well enough, the People's Assembly, for not only coming together and having this event, but documenting the concerns that many of us are having," Dr. Marvin Cheatham, of the NAACP Baltimore, said.As of now in Maryland, 44 people have been tested for the coronavirus.

Gov. Larry Hogan said the two of the three patients who tested positive for the coronavirus had some interaction with the public.

Gov. Larry Hogan said two of the three patients who tested positive for coronavirus had some interaction with the public.According to Hogan, the three patients are a married couple in their 70s and a woman in her 50s. "I want to continue to assure Marylanders that our state is taking every precaution when it comes to the coronavirus and our highest priority is keeping our residents safe," Hogan said.|| Maryland Health Department coronavirus information ||Hogan declared a state of emergency Thursday for Maryland, after the three people tested positive for the coronavirus. On Friday, the Maryland state Senate unanimously passed Hogan's emergency legislation to free up to $50 million to help combat the virus. Officials confirmed that all three traveled on the M.S. Asara, an Egyptian cruise ship on the Nile River, but said it did not originate out of Baltimore. Those three patients are also connected to six confirmed coronavirus cases in Texas."This does appear to be the same cruise ship that the World Health Organization announced today has 12 workers who have been placed in quarantined for 14 days," Hogan said. Officials said five family members of the patients confirmed with the coronavirus will also be advised to undergo testing.  One patient attended a school event in the Philadelphia area. As a precaution, the Central Bucks Schools District closed five schools Friday. Another patient attended an event at the Village at Rockville retirement community Feb. 28. The Maryland Department of Health determined the time period of risk of exposure is from noon to 6 p.m."The facility there has a workforce staff that they will be looking after, monitoring to make sure that those health care workers do not develop symptoms. They also are very cooperative in making sure that residents that may have been exposed only at that one gathering, that one day, that one gathering, if those residents have any symptoms," said Fran Phillips, of the Maryland Department of Health.The MDH recommended that members of the public who attended the event should monitor themselves for symptoms of a respiratory infection, including fever, cold-like symptoms, cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, until March 13. Members of the public who have questions about this information are encouraged to call the Maryland Emergency Management Agency call center at 410-517-3720. The call center is available until midnight tonight and from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. || LINK: JHU DASHBOARD ||Adrienne Jones, speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, and Sen.

We have the best health professionals in the world and have complete confidence in the ability of the medical community and the state and local governments to work together to contain the effects of the COVID-19 virus."Maryland coronavirus in numbers: March 6Number of patients tested for COVID-19: 44Number of COVID-19 tests pending: 8 Number of negative COVID-19 tests: 33Number of positive COVID-19 tests: 3  Hogan said the number of cases being monitored for indirect contact stands at 374.On Tuesday, Hogan announced that the Maryland State Public Health Laboratory has been approved to test for the virus, meaning test results will no longer need to be sent to Atlanta and the wait for results will shorten."While we continue to hope for the best, we are actively preparing for the worst," Hogan said Wednesday.On Wednesday morning, Hogan said the Maryland Emergency Management Agency raised the state's activation level to enhanced in order to mobilize additional resources. He said the administration is also submitting a supplemental budget, which includes $10 million in an emergency coronavirus preparedness fund. Emergency legislation was also submitted to allow for the ability to transfer available resources from the rainy day fund for costs stemming from the state's coronavirus response efforts.Hogan talked last week about how the state is addressing the coronavirus threat and how residents should prepare. The governor and state health officials made it clear that Maryland is currently considered a "low-level risk." Hogan said there is no immediate health threat in Maryland but that the state is taking every precaution to address the coronavirus.Archbishop William Lori ordered clergy to suspend the sign of peace at Masses and stop offering consecrated wine, the Archdiocese of Baltimore announced Tuesday."Parishioners should forgo shaking hands during the sign of peace and instead greet their neighbor with a bow and the words 'peace be with you,'" the archdiocese posted online.President Donald Trump said the focus regarding the spread of the virus is on trying to develop a vaccine, but that process could take as long as a year. The president visited the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda on Tuesday afternoon. He visited the vaccine research center, where he participated in a roundtable briefing.Many people are asking how to prepare for the virus and avoid getting sick. The Howard County Health Department will address concerns from the public in a series of free community presentations, the last of  which will be at 2 p.m. March 10 at the Miller Library. The classes are free, but residents have to register to attend.Sinai Hospital PreparednessHospitals in Maryland are prepared and said everyone needs to take precautions to keep from getting sick with any respiratory illness."I think we all need to be prepared because it's just a matter of time before it spreads from other parts of the country," said Dr. Kjell Wiberg, an infectious disease specialist at Sinai Hospital.Prepared, but not panicked. Wiberg said the coronavirus spreads like any other respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu, by people coming in contact with infected droplets."The problem with the coronavirus is that because nobody has immunity against it, it tends to make us sicker at this point," Wiberg said.To prevent getting any virus, the same rules of good hygiene apply. Wash your hands or use sanitizer frequently; don't cough into your hand, use your elbow; and if you're sick, stay home. Be careful of hidden areas that harbor germs, such as doorknobs, gas pumps and cellphones."If I don't remember when I washed my hands the last time and I've been touching things, I use alcohol sanitizer if I have nothing else to use," Wiberg said.Wiberg also said face masks won't help protect you from getting sick but will protect others from your germs.Sinai Hospital had to move its masks behind the information desk because people were grabbing handfuls from the entrance, and it's keeping tabs on the coronavirus."We've stepped up our hospital incident command center. This allows us to develop a coordinated communication plan, and we're able to effectively communicate with all our hospitals, our outpatient and our ambulatory areas," said Martha Hill, Sinai's emergency preparedness coordinator.On a daily basis, hospital staff are taking normal precautions for any respiratory illness, including face masks and eye protection. They also have a protocol and isolation rooms for any possible cases."First, we would identify those symptoms in the patient, and then immediately, we would mask that patient and move them to an airborne isolation room," said Hill.Wiberg said many viruses die off as the weather gets warmer, but since coronavirus is so new, doctors aren't sure that will happen.Johns Hopkins InvolvementJohns Hopkins is at the forefront of gathering data and information about the coronavirus. Its scientists created an interactive map showing how the virus is spreading in real time.They are also looking at how prepared the nation is for this international crisis.During a webinar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, experts said the United States is No. 1 in five of six categories for preparedness -- prevention, early detection and reporting, rapid response and mitigation, sufficient and robust health system, and compliance with international norms.The study, co-led by Jennifer Nuzzo, said the U.S. has work to do with respect to health care access."I fear if the cost of health care is a deterrent, then that could create a bad situation where people either remain at home or in their community potentially infecting others," Nuzzo said.The scientists said it's also important to expand testing so we can know how much of the virus is out there, for how long and how quickly it's moving. With testing, a rise in new cases is predicted."Those new cases may expand very quickly. They were always there; it's not that we are having an explosion in the community. It's that we're finding the cases that are there," said Tara Sell, of Johns Hopkins.             BALTIMORE

Two more cases of coronavirus have been identified in Maryland by state officials.

Gov. Larry Hogan announced Sunday that state officials have identified two additional positive cases of the novel coronavirus in the state of Maryland. The state now has five total confirmed cases, and 62 negative tests for COVID-19.The two new positive cases are a woman, a Harford County resident in her 80s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas and is currently hospitalized and a man, a Montgomery County resident in his 60s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas and was briefly hospitalized.In both cases, there appear to be no major concerns over exposure risk to the community and there is no connection to the previous positive cases.“Our state health department team has been working seamlessly with local health departments, and our emergency management teams are engaged with our local and federal partners to limit the spread of COVID-19,” said Hogan. “We continue to hope for the best, and actively plan for the worst.

At that time, he will be joined by House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson to sign emergency legislation granting the governor the authority to use the state's rainy day fund to mobilize additional resources.“We continue to monitor the rapidly changing situation with COVID-19,” said MDH Deputy Secretary for Public Health Fran Phillips. “As we learn more, Marylanders are encouraged to practice everyday actions to promote good health and to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory viruses — wash your hands thoroughly, cover your cough, and avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home from work and school if you’re not feeling well. People over 60 should stay home as much as possible, and follow CDC guidance regarding travel.”Maryland is currently operating under a state of emergency, and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency has elevated its state response activation level.

Hogan confirms 2 new cases of coronavirus in Maryland
.W
With two more confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland on Sunday, the total is now five.

There are two more confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland, bringing the total number in the state to five. One of the new cases is an 86-year-old woman in Harford County. The other is a man in Montgomery County in his 60s. In both cases, they traveled overseas. Where they went has not been released. According to the governor's press office, the woman remains in the hospital and the man had a brief stay in the hospital.  The University of Maryland Medical System Incident Command Center issued a statement, saying, in part, that the patient  "after testing positive continues to be appropriately treated in isolation until such time that clinical guidelines indicate that they are able to be released from our care." Gov. Larry Hogan said the state is prepared to test as many as 1,000 people. He told Meet the Press that he expects even more kits to become available. “At this point, we have the necessary resources, I think we're about to double the number of test kits we have, but this is obviously an issue that(Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Dr. (Anthony) Fauci talked about, that we have been hearing a lot about. Ramping this up as the crisis escalates is a concern among all the governors," Hogan said.Hogan said there is no major concerns about an exposure risk to the community, nor a connection to the previous cases. Experts warn the elderly with an underlying condition are at risk.   "It's our responsibility to protect the vulnerable. When I say protect, I mean right now, not wait until things get worse. No large crowds, no long trips and above all, don't get on a cruise ship," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Hogan has released $10 million from his supplemental budget to address the virus. Maryland lawmakers passed an emergency bill allowing him to tap into $50 million more from the state's rainy day fund. The governor told Meet the Press his declaration of a State of Emergency provides flexibility."It allows us to tap into a lot of resources we otherwise couldn't do," Hogan said.             BALTIMORE

Harford County officials identified one of the latest patients who tested positive for COVID-19 as an 86-year-old woman who returned from overseas.

Harford County officials identified one of the latest patients who tested positive for COVID-19 as an 86-year-old woman who returned from overseas.Officials said she not only got her symptoms six days after returning, but that her initial symptoms were loss of appetite and fatigue, not respiratory issues.Still, health officials said there is no reason to be alarmed.|| Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coronavirus || "Right now, it is important for everyone to stay calm and stay informed," said Harford County County Executive Barry Glassman. Glassman explained to residents in his county to keep calm after an 86-year-old woman came down with coronavirus after returning home from overseas."There appears to be no major exposure to the community as this person went straight from the airport to home, did not exhibit symptoms until approximately six days after returning to the country," said Harford County health officer Dr. Russell W. Moy.Harford County health officials said the woman eventually became fatigued and lost her appetite, so she went to the hospital."During this entire time, the patient states that she did not leave her house, did not come into contact with people except for her immediate family who have shown no symptoms and who are being asked to self-isolate and self-monitor for 14 days," Moy said.Harford County school officials have had a chance to review the case and said things will remain as is for now."We do not, let me say that again, we do not have plans to close schools or cancel activities at this time," said Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.In the meantime, Glassman said his health department will continue to monitor things with the state, also saying right now, no major county events will be canceled."There are no changes reported since yesterday and at this time, we do not have any recommendations for schedule changes or community closures based on this case," said Glassman.WBAL-TV 11 News were told the elderly woman is resting well at an unnamed hospital.Health officials in Harford County are reminding people to get latest information on COVID-19 -- click here for more information.

Out-of-state travel for state employees canceled amid coronovirus outbreak

Gov. Larry Hogan says he has cancelled all out of state travel for all state employees and is telling all state agencies to prepare all employees for telework in order to stop the spread of this new disease.

Gov. Larry Hogan said he has canceled all out-of-state travel for all state employees and is telling all state agencies to prepare all employees for telework in order to stop the spread of this new disease.On day five of Maryland's coronavirus state of emergency, Hogan signed emergency legislation into law.The coronavirus spending bill passed unanimously through the statehouse, a green light for the governor to tap up to $50 million from the rainy day fund to pay for the state's coronavirus response."Given the rapidly evolving nature of this threat to public health, it is critical we have the flexibility to immediately access these resources," Hogan said.Hogan with an update on the coronavirus: Maryland's two new positive cases connected to travel in Turkey, Thailand and Egypt, and that 12 Marylanders are among the thousands stranded on board the Grand Princess cruise ship, docked off the coast of California."We have been told the 12 Marylanders on the cruise are not apparently exhibiting symptoms and we are working closely with our federal partners," said Hogan.The governor's update came shortly after his afternoon inside the White House situation room, meeting with the Vice President Mike Pence and federal officials in a teleconference with the nation's governors.Also Monday, Hogan said while it's too early to talk mandatory quarantines and school closings, it's also too early to cross it out completely."The facts are changing not only daily, but almost hourly up to the minute, and so as of right now, that's not an issue but wouldn't rule it out as something that could potentially happen in the future," said Hogan on CNN.This was Hogan's second situation room teleconference with his counterparts nationwide.Hogan is the current chair of the National Governor's Association, and expressed hope that federal officials and all the governors will soon be on the same page in terms of facts and information.

Wall Street took another beating Monday, as the Dow Jones had its worst point drop ever, but a local financial analyst warns consumers to not get too wrapped up in the bad news.Investors were already worried about COVID-19, the coronavirus, then the growing oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia jumped into the mix.The analyst 11 News spoke with is urging consumers to be educated and patient.The Dow Jones closed the day with a loss of 2,000 points and oil prices dropped 25% in one day. But even with all that, financial consultant and managing director of UBS in Hunt Valley Jonathan Murray said: "It's a good thing that stocks dropped 2,000 points today."Murray is focusing on the positive."Because stocks are now much cheaper than they were on Friday and so if you're a long-term investor, you want to buy low when stock prices are down and ultimately when you're getting ready to retire and cash in your chips -- sell high," he said.So, he said now is the time to buy if you can, not only stocks but real estate. Murray said:Interest rates have hit historic lows -- that means mortgage rates are coming down.So, look into refinancing if you own a house. If not, and you've been considering, it's a good time to buy one.Also, expect lower gas prices.But as we all watch the market response, Murray suggests checking in with financial advisers about any exposure you have to energy stocks. With the numbers seen Monday, he predicts some energy companies will go out of business.He also has concerns about retirees."Older people who don't have income coming in, they're retired, who are 100% in stocks and if a lot of those stocks were in the energy sector, I would worry about those folks. That's going to be a tough situation," Murray said.

State lawmakers are taking up emergency legislation to make access to health care easier during the coronavirus outbreak.

State lawmakers are taking up emergency legislation to make access to health care easier during the coronavirus outbreak. The measure also prohibits price gouging and firing workers who are quarantined.The legislation is viewed as another proactive step to protect residents and make it easier to get treatment, if necessary. Sen. Clarence Lam is one of the bill sponsors."We are seeing rising cases of COVID-19 throughout the state. I think the Legislature needs to take some proactive steps to empower the governor with the tools that he needs to properly respond to this public health crisis," Lam said. The bill would reduce costs and barriers to tests and coronavirus-related health care and co-pays would be waived. It would improve access to telehealth services and would limit exposure to health care workers and the public. It also would provide better access to a vaccine when it becomes available. It would prohibit price gouging and workers under isolation or quarantine would not lose their jobs."I think what is being proposed makes sense," said Sen. Delores KelleyThe emergency bill goes before the finance committee Wednesday. Kelley is the chairperson."We are looking forward to seeing what people think and hope that we will be coming out with something that makes sense. We don't know if we will make it through the session before a state of crisis, so we've got to think ahead," Kelley said.If needed, the proposed emergency legislation will remain in effect until April 30, 2021.​             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

TU: Classes canceled this week, preparing for possible remote teaching after spring break
.W
Towson University announced Tuesday the cancellation of all university classes for the remainder of week to prepare for potential remote teaching, learning and working after spring break during the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Towson University officials announced that they would be canceling classes for the rest of the week ahead of spring break next week, at all of its campuses.This is all being done out of an abundance of caution as there have been no confirmed cases on campus of COVID-19, the coronavirus."I think it’s a really good decision. I think it’s getting out of hand. I think everyone leaving for spring break and then coming back might not be a great idea for campus," said Towson student Alli Gigliotti.Students at Towson University reacted to the news after university officials announced that due to concerns over coronavirus, classes will be canceled the rest of the week ahead of spring break."We are also worried about it, so I think it is a good idea to get people to go home, just, like, let the campus relax and do its own thing," said Towson student Jada Stephens.University officials are also asking students to take all essential belongings from their residence halls or workspaces in case access is restricted to campus for at least two weeks after spring break."I’m real happy about the decision. I’m happy no class, but I’m worried that this is a real thing and I don’t want anybody getting infected and put us in danger," said Towson student Robert Herron.Students are also being asked to prepare for possibly moving all teaching and learning online after spring break."I have classes in the mass communications building so I had a class there this morning and I didn’t really feel comfortable even going to that so I’m glad they kind of didn’t make that decision for us," said Towson student Miranda Mowery.Several days ago, the university suspended all international travel and recalled students and staff who were abroad.Also, effective immediately all university-sponsored events and gatherings, including events sponsored by any registered student organizations, have been suspended through March 22.Towson University's main campus will be open even if in-person classes are restricted after spring break.But right now, the plans are to come back as normal after spring break, but that could change should things get worse.Last Friday, Towson announced the suspension of all spring break and summer 2020 study abroad programs.

Due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Johns Hopkins University will transition to remote instruction for all classroom-based academic programs.

Due to the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Johns Hopkins University said it will transition to remote instruction for all classroom-based academic programs.In a statement sent Tuesday, JHU said it is encouraging undergraduate students not to return to campus from spring break next week and to plan to remain home through at least April 12."Remote undergraduate instruction will begin March 23. With the exception of clinical and laboratory-based programs or the equivalent, graduate instruction will also move course delivery to a remote format as quickly as possible," the university said. The university confirmed there are members of the JHU community, including several students, in the process of being tested for coronavirus. Officials are awaiting the results of those testsUniversity officials said they will continue to closely monitor the situation.The university continued in its statement: "Other than these changes, the university remains fully open.

They've identified and contacted those people, though they wouldn't say how many are now being monitored as a result.Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said to expect large, nonessential, county-sponsored events to be postponed or canceled. Officials are still working out what that would look like.Anne Arundel County Public Schools Superintendent George Arlotto said schools are open and sports are still on and said they have a plan to maintain operations, instruction and meal delivery in the event of long-term closures. Plans include two weeks of lessons taught online and on  television in order to reach every student at every grade level. Arlotto announced immediate cancellation of all school-system related large-scale public events and all school field trips that are not part of the core mission of school system instruction.Spring athletic contests will be allowed to continue, though games, matches and meets will take place without spectators, officials said.No additional positive cases have been confirmed in Maryland because of the Montana visitor.

An outbreak of viral pneumonia that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 has now sickened thousands.

Posted on January 30, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.An outbreak of viral pneumonia that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 has now sickened thousands, and led to more than 100 deaths. Although much is still unknown, scientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which temporarily goes by the name 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. As the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We’ve written about several bogus claims about the new coronavirus, and will continue to debunk stories as they surface.Here, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus.When did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause?Scientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. After a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated 2019-nCoV as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began.Coronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope.Most coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. But in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012.According to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths.The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus — and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses — but is considered a new pathogen.What are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease?The virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. A report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for 2019-nCoV infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. Some people also report fatigue, and in at least one case, a person has been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms.Many of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases, so unless a person has been to Wuhan, China — or been in contact with someone who has — the illness is unlikely to be due to the new coronavirus. Lab tests based on the virus’ genetic sequence can confirm infection. As of Jan. 30, 171 people have died, out of 8,235 confirmed cases worldwide. That suggests, very roughly, a case fatality rate of around 2-3%. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email.These figures, however, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, Fisman said, since the disease course is still underway for many patients. It’s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be around 1%.According to the WHO, as of Jan. 28, about 20% of confirmed cases have been severe. Clinical guidance from the WHO suggests the most serious concerns for patients are the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and sepsis, both of which can be fatal.Initial reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill, deaths are largely confined to older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and liver cirrhosis.There nevertheless has been one report of a 36-year-old man with no known health concerns who died.How is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?While the new virus almost certainly was first transmitted to people from an animal, it’s clear from how the pathogen has spread that the virus can be passed from person to person.Scientists aren’t yet sure how that’s happening, but they suspect it is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through saliva droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread.The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be 2 to 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. China has suggested that it is possible for people to be contagious during this period, but the CDC does not yet have evidence for that. Fisman noted that the timing of some of the German cases also suggests potential asymptomatic transmission, but he said more data is needed to know for sure.It’s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate 2019-nCoV’s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible.Using a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world.“Despite the diversity of approaches taken there’s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,” said Fisman.An early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.All of the estimates are preliminary, and limited by the available data, which is changing by the day. While the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it’s important to recognize that these values don’t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. As Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission — and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases.“Planning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,” Majumder said in a tweet. “Because of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.”Where have cases been reported?As of Jan. 30, there have been 8,235 confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, and more than half in Hubei province, which is home to Wuhan. Many other Chinese cities have recorded dozens of cases, including more than 100 in Shanghai and Beijing.Numerous other Asian countries, such as Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam, have reported at least two cases.The U.S. has confirmed five cases, current as of Jan. 29, and Canada has three. The first cases in Europe were reported in France on Jan. 24.Given the speed of the outbreak, these tallies will soon be out of date, but updates are available in a visualization tool put together by Johns Hopkins University that pulls information from the WHO, the CDC and Chinese sources.The CDC has also launched its own state and global maps to show the location of confirmed cases. What information do we have about the U.S. cases?The CDC announced the first American case on Jan. 21 in a man in his 30s who returned home to Washington state after a trip to Wuhan and then fell ill. He is reportedly in satisfactory condition and remains in isolation at a hospital north of Seattle as of Jan. 27. The CDC confirmed a second case on Jan. 24 in a Chicago woman. The woman, who is in her 60s, also had recently been to Wuhan; she is stable and is hospitalized largely to prevent disease spread.Both patients did not have symptoms until they were already in the U.S.Three more cases were announced on Jan. 26: one in Arizona, in an Arizona State University student, and two in California, including one in Orange County and another in a Wuhan resident flying through Los Angeles International Airport.The CDC announced on Jan. 30 the first instance of person-to-person transmission of the virus, in this case, from the Chicago woman to her husband, who had not traveled to Wuhan. This case is not yet reflected in the total case counts.Health officials suspect that there will be more American cases over time, although the CDC considers the immediate risk to Americans to be low.Where did the virus come from?Scientists do not yet know the origin of the virus, but coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses, meaning they can transfer from animals to humans.Both the SARS and MERS coronaviruses are thought to have started in bats, and then made the jump into humans through other animals — civets and racoon dogs, in the case of SARS, and camels in the case of MERS.For 2019-nCoV, experts also suspect the virus originated in bats, although that has not yet been demonstrated. An unpublished analysis of several viral genomes from patients indicates the virus is about 80% similar to SARS, but shares even more similarity — 96% — to a SARS-like bat virus.“It very likely suggests the virus  from bats,” Yize Li, a researcher working on coronaviruses in the Weiss lab at the University of Pennsylvania, told us.But even if bats are the so-called reservoir for the virus, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a bat transmitted the virus directly to a human. As with SARS and MERS, there could be an as-yet unidentified intermediate host.“We believe that an intermediate host might be involved, but we don’t know for sure and we don’t know what animal,” said Kristian Andersen, a professor of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, in an email.Scientists also have been comparing viral sequences from numerous patients to begin to understand when the virus first emerged and how the outbreak first unfolded. An analysis from Andersen, for instance, found that the data is “highly suggestive” of a single introduction into the human population, followed by human-to-human transfer.Another assessment from the University of Edinburgh’s Andrew Rambaut, based on the viral genomes from 42 patients, estimates the virus popped up in late November.What is China doing to combat the outbreak, and how is the rest of the world responding?China closed the seafood market in Wuhan that is suspected of spreading the virus on Jan. 1. The government proceeded to cordon off the entire city about three weeks later, just before the Lunar New Year, cancelling air and train travel in or out of Wuhan, and shutting down all public transit within the city. The transportation lockdown has since been extended to other cities in the same province, affecting an estimated 56 million people. Such quarantine efforts of this magnitude are unprecedented, and it remains to be seen how effective they are at limiting the spread of the virus. The mayor of Wuhan acknowledged that as many as 5 million people left Wuhan before the lockdown was put into effect, which may have undercut much of its value. Some experts have also suggested that the strategy could backfire, if the travel restrictions make it more difficult to deliver supplies.On Jan. 26, China also banned the sale of wild animals until the outbreak resolves.Several neighboring countries, including Malaysia and Mongolia, have begun limiting travel from China, while others, including the U.S., have started to evacuate citizens from Wuhan. Hong Kong has announced it will be halting rail transit from mainland China, and slashing the number of flights in half. On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency, or what is officially known as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, or PHEIC. The decision alerts nations to the gravity of the situation, and was made, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, primarily because of what could happen outside of China. “Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it,” he said.For its part, the CDC began screening travelers flying in from Wuhan for signs of infection at U.S. airports on Jan. 17, and is in the process of testing people for suspected cases of the disease. As of Jan.  29, the agency said that it had identified a total of 165 suspected cases across 36 states, including 5 confirmed cases and 68 negative ones.On Jan. 27, the CDC also issued a level 3 travel alert, its highest, advising travelers to avoid “all nonessential travel” to China. Previously, the agency had only advised people to avoid traveling to Wuhan or Hubei province.What is the outlook for the outbreak?It is still too early to tell how the outbreak will unfold, including how long it might last, how widespread the virus will become and the ultimate death toll.But while the Wuhan coronavirus is very concerning globally, for almost all Americans, seasonal influenza is a greater health risk. As Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who was actively involved in responding to the SARS epidemic, told the Washington Post, flu claims 30,000 to 40,000 American lives every year. “It is very unlikely,” he said, “that this will ever reach the level that we annually lose to flu.” The CDC estimates there were more than 34,000 flu-related deaths in the U.S. in the 2018-19 flu season.As we have written before, there is no 2019-nCoV vaccine yet available for people to use. A lab in Hong Kong announced on Jan. 28 that they had already developed one, but that it would still take months to test the vaccine on animals, and an additional year to do clinical trials before it would be ready to use.Other researchers around the world, including those in the U.S., are also racing to create a vaccine, but the timetables are the same. Even with fast-tracking, it’s almost certain no vaccine will be ready for another year, which likely means this outbreak will conclude without the benefit of one.According to the CDC, the best way to prevent coronavirus infection is to do all the things that one usually should do to avoid respiratory viruses, including washing your hands with soap, avoiding touching your face and avoiding those who are sick.There is no need for people in the U.S. to wear face masks unless someone is infected with 2019-nCoV, or a health care worker is treating someone who is infected. Physicians and other providers, however, should use specialized respirators, which can actually filter out most of the viral particles. The basic surgical masks aren’t worthless — for those in crowded areas of China, they’re a good idea because they will limit some exposure  — but they’re not especially protective.

As of Jan.  29, the agency  said  that it had identified a total of 165 suspected cases across 36 states, including 5 confirmed cases and 68 negative ones. On Jan. 27, the CDC also  issued  a level 3 travel  alert , its highest, advising travelers to avoid “all nonessential travel” to China. Previously, the agency had only advised people to avoid traveling to  Wuhan  or  Hubei province . What is the outlook for the outbreak? It is still  too early  to tell how the outbreak will unfold, including how long it might last, how widespread the virus will become and the ultimate death toll.                     But while the Wuhan coronavirus is very concerning globally, for almost all Americans, seasonal influenza is a greater health risk. As  Ian Lipkin , an epidemiologist at Columbia University who was actively involved in responding to the SARS epidemic,  told  the  Washington Post,  flu claims 30,000 to 40,000 American lives every year. “It is very unlikely,” he said, “that this will ever reach the level that we annually lose to flu.” The CDC  estimates  there were more than 34,000 flu-related deaths in the U.S. in the 2018-19 flu season. As we have written  before , there is no 2019-nCoV vaccine yet available for people to use. A lab in Hong Kong  announced  on Jan. 28 that they had already developed one, but that it would still take months to test the vaccine on animals, and an additional year to do clinical trials before it would be ready to use. Other researchers around the world, including  those  in the U.S., are also racing to create a vaccine, but the timetables are the same. Even with fast-tracking, it’s almost certain no vaccine will be ready for another year, which  likely  means this outbreak will conclude without the benefit of one. According to the CDC, the best way to  prevent  coronavirus infection is to do all the things that one usually should do to avoid respiratory viruses, including washing your hands with soap, avoiding touching your face and avoiding those who are sick.                                                                                                            Do masks offer protection from coronavirus?                          There is  no need  for people in the U.S. to wear face masks unless someone is infected with 2019-nCoV, or a health care worker is treating someone who is infected. Physicians and other providers, however, should use specialized respirators, which can actually filter out most of the viral particles. The basic surgical masks aren’t worthless — for those in crowded areas of China, they’re a good idea because they will limit some exposure  — but they’re not especially protective.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski to retire
.W
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, announced Monday that she will not run for-re-election.

Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a tough and dogged daughter of working class Baltimore who rose to become the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress, said she had one question as she weighed seeking a sixth term: "Do I spend my time raising money, or do I spend my time raising hell?"Watch: Deborah Weiner's exclusive interview with Sen. MikulskiWatch: Sen. Mikulski's press conference in its entiretyMore: Read Sen. Mikulski's full statement | Marylanders reactMore: Potential candidates in 2016More: Sen. Mikulski through the years in photosThe 78-year-old Maryland Democrat, who led the powerful Appropriations Committee, announced Monday that she'd decided on the latter approach and would not seek re-election next year when her fifth term ends."I don't want to spend my time campaigning for me. I want to campaign for the people," she said at a news conference in Fells Point, the now-trendy waterfront neighborhood where her parents had a grocery store and her immigrant grandparents ran a bakery. It's also where Mikulski got her first taste of politics leading an effort to stop an expressway from coming through.Her announcement opens the way for what could be a raucous fight next year to replace her in Maryland's first open Senate seat in a decade. Potential candidates include former governors - Democrat Martin O'Malley and Republican Bob Ehrlich - and current House members, among them Republican Andy Harris and Democrats Chris Van Hollen, Donna Edwards and Elijah Cummings. Democratic Rep. John Delaney, a wealthy former businessman, made the first move, announcing over Twitter that he would explore the race.More: Who could vie to replace Mikulski | Watch Kate Amara's reportAlthough Maryland voters lean heavily Democratic, especially in presidential election years, the state elected a Republican governor last fall and Republicans insist they will compete hard in the Senate race.The pugnacious Mikulski, who stands less than five feet tall, has for years been a force to be reckoned with on Capitol Hill, barreling through the halls while gruffly ordering people aside en route to committee hearings and news conferences.She is not one for social niceties and her prickly personality does not always endear, yet she won the devotion of Maryland voters as she advocated forcefully for her constituents, from Chesapeake Bay watermen to NASA scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center. She has won re-election easily in the past and was expected to do so again if she sought another term next year.A strong liberal voice for women, seniors, and the environment, Mikulski became the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress in 2012. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and has served in the Senate since 1987.When Mikulski was first elected there was only one other woman in the Senate; now there are 20. For years she has been a mentor and role model to other female senators, Republican and Democrat, and is even credited with getting rid of the chamber's requirement that women wear skirts on the Senate floor."When Sen. Mikulski decided that she was going to wear pants while casting her votes, it was the rule that had to change, not her," said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a protege. "She fought for us before we even got here, walked into rooms women had not been welcome in before, and made sure to keep her foot stuck in the door."President Barack Obama lauded Mikulski in a statement as an institution and an inspiration."Senator Mikulski is more than just a legendary senator for the people of Maryland. She's an institution in the United States Senate," the president said. "Barbara is the longest-serving woman in Congress, and her leadership serves as an inspiration to millions of women and girls across the globe to stand up and lead."Mikulski said Monday that when her term has ended, "I will know that I will have given it my best shot.""I want the people of Maryland to know there's nothing gloomy about this announcement," she added. "There's no health problem. I'm not frustrated with the Senate."She becomes the second Senate Democratic woman to announce her retirement this year, following Barbara Boxer of California."My last day in the Senate will be when I walk down the aisle with the next Democratic senator from Maryland.  I will walk down that aisle as Sen. Sarbanes did with me.  It'll be me, Sen. Ben Cardin and Paul Sarbanes. We'll have the new senator's back. I hope it will be a Democrat. We'll shake hands and turn it over to the next generation," Mikulski exclusively told 11 News reporter Deborah Weiner.In a 2014 interview, Mikulski said her approach as chair of the Appropriations panel was "to focus with civility and courtesy. Old school values. Don't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press."Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described Mikulski at the time as forceful and results-oriented. "I think she's terrific," he said.She spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties, learning their needs and end goals. After a short tenure as chairman, she now is the top Democrat on the panel after Republicans captured control of the Senate in last November's elections.Mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women. She sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill in an April 2014 floor showdown."When I hear all these phony reasons, some are mean and some are meaningless, I do get emotional," Mikulski said of arguments against the legislation. "I get angry. I get outraged. I get volcanic."Mobile users tap here for photos             BALTIMORE

Hogan, state leaders announce school closures, new steps amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan and other Maryland officials announced Thursday new actions against coronavirus after the first case of community transmitted coronovirus was confirmed in the state.

During Gov. Larry Hogan's news conference Thursday, the Maryland State Superintendent announced all public schools will close for two weeks starting Monday.Maryland public schools and Catholic schools will be closed March 16 until Friday, March 27.State Superintendent Karen Salmon explained why she's taking such drastic measures."It is crucial that we take immediate measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in school communities around the state. During the time of school closures all public school buildings and school buses will be cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of the virus upon the return of students and staff return to school," said Salmon.Families are being pressed to make plans over the weekend. For those looking ahead to spring break, there will be even more changes."Additionally, I am recommending that days previously scheduled for spring break be used for makeup days of the school closure. Administrators, faculty, staff, parents and guardians should begin to immediately prepare for and put into place for the continuity during a prolonged period of school closures," said Salmon.President of the Maryland State Education Association Cheryl Bost said the following in a statement: “We appreciate the leadership of Gov. Hogan and legislators to put the health and safety of students and all Marylanders at the forefront. We encourage all Marylanders to take appropriate precautions and help the less fortunate among us during the challenging weeks ahead."Expect some school systems to send home learning packets on Friday, while others will be told how to find lessons online.On top of those concerns, plans are being made to feed children who are accustomed to receiving free breakfast, lunch and in some cases dinner.Parents and students react to sudden closure of schools. Watch video below Archbishop William Lori said in a statement: “In light of the order today by Gov. Larry Hogan that all public schools be closed for the next two weeks, I have similarly instructed that all archdiocesan schools be closed during the same time period, March 16-27, 2020 and that all school-sponsored activities be cancelled during that same timeframe. In addition, I have instructed all parishes of the Archdiocese of Baltimore to comply with the Governor’s order by limiting attendance at all Masses and parish-sponsored events, regardless of location, to no more than 250 people until further notice.”"Earlier today, the Archbishop created a task force to guide all Archdiocesan decisions related to the COVID-19 virus, to be led by Auxiliary Bishop Adam J. Parker, and distributed detailed guidance to all parishes on liturgical safeguards, parish events and meetings, travel, and other related concerns. In addition, Archdiocesan schools have been making preparations for the offering of distance learning and out-of-school instruction."New Phase in Coronavirus crisisHogan and other state leaders announced more sweeping changes to slow the spread of coronavirus in Maryland.Hogan declared a new phase in this crisis. The state is going from containment to a mitigating approach.He outlined some extraordinary steps; they include calling up the Maryland National Guard.There will be no mass gatherings of 250 people or more. This includes religious as well.He is closing the cruise ship terminal. He is even delegating some of his official duties to Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford so he can focus on the coronavirus crisis. "For Marylanders, the actions that I have announced today will be disruptive to our everyday lives. and they may sound extreme and they may sound frightening. But they could be the difference in saving lives and helping keep people safe. They do not mean however that daily life as we know it should come to a halt," said Hogan State House leaders are meeting at this hour discussing next steps. Earlier Thursday, they canceled receptions, rallies and organized state house tours. Bills will be heard by sponsor only. The public can still submit testimony electronically.​             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

Amid coronavirus outbreak, state legislators want to end 2020 session early
.W
Many legislators 11 News spoke to said under the circumstances surrounding the coronavirus, they would like the 2020 session to end early.

The State House resembles a ghost town Friday night as only essential employees and lawmakers are there. The coronavirus has just about everyone worried and talking about whether the session should end early.Worry is now framing the session. Legislators want to get their work done quickly, and that includes passing the budget and emergency legislation dealing with the virus.The coronavirus is making legislators in Annapolis uneasy. Presiding officers are addressing those fears at the start of each session."The moment there is a sense of true danger and fear or something that would cause a significant concern, we will not hesitate to make decisive decisions," said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City. Many legislators 11 News spoke to said under the circumstances, they would like the 2020 session to end early. "Let's get the budget passed. Let's focus on the issues that we need to pass to get us on the other side of this fiscal year so that we come back, whether it be through a special session or next year," Sen. J.B. Jennings, Republican and minority leader.The House will soon send the budget to Gov. Larry Hogan's desk. The budget is the only constitutionally required bill that requires legislative approval each year. The spending plan contains the $10 million the governor wants to help with the state's response to the coronavirus. The money goes to the Health Department which is capable of testing 100 people a day."We have on hand over 800, the capability to do over 800. We have now ordered another thousand cases from the CDC," said Deputy Health Secretary Fran Phillips. Both the House and Senate will soon pass emergency coronavirus legislation: It reduces costs because co-pays are waived and barriers to tests It improves access to telehealthProvides better access to a vaccine when it becomes available, Prohibits price gouging and workers under isolation or quarantine cannot lose their jobs because of that."I think the Legislature needs to take some proactive steps to empower the governor with the tools that he needs to property respond to this public health crisis," said bill sponsor Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties.In a rare move, both the House and Senate will convene over the entire weekend. They'll take up the budget, the virus emergency legislation and the Kirwan education bill.             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

The Maryland Food Bank is trying to reach more people who live in food deserts by taking its pantry on the road.Its new Mobile Market is getting set to roll out on the Eastern Shore. From cabbage to potatoes to meat, the Maryland Food Bank's Mobile Market is packed with food for hungry residents. The organization brought the vehicle to WBALTV-11 for a look before it headed out to communities on the Eastern Shore."On the Eastern Shore we are very rural, so there are many areas that are challenged by geography, surrounded by farmland and water, where households are challenged with things such as lack of transportation or geography not having a grocery store within 30 miles of access to them. The Mobile Market will allow us to get into communities and really hit clients where they are," said regional program Director Jennifer Small.According to the Maryland Food Bank, one in nine families on the Eastern Shore is challenged by food insecurities.Along with nutritious food, food bank officials said it will also distribute recipes and provide other health information.The Mobile Market is made possible thanks to Perdue Farms.The Mobile Market will go to 12 different communities on the Eastern Shore, initially, but ultimately they hope to duplicate this in communities throughout the state."Hunger is statewide. It's just not on the Eastern Shore. We're able to implement this on the Eastern Shore because of Purdue Farms, but the goal is to be able to have an opportunity to put this into every area, because we know we have to target hunger statewide," Small said.​             BALTIMORE

Baltimore City is taking an extra step to prevent the spread of coronavirus cases.According to Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, all city-permitted events of more than 250 people are canceled at least through the end of March.Starting Friday, city senior centers will be closed except to provide boxed lunches through the end of the month."The goal of this guidance is to protect people attending and working at an event, as well as safeguard individuals from the community from potential exposure to COVID-19," Young said. "We also are seeking to reduce the potential for community transition , decrease the risk of introduction of COVID-19  to communities as well decrease the potential spread of the virus."Evictions in Baltimore City are halted while schools are closed due to the growing virus.Young reached out to Baltimore City Sheriff John W.

Gov. Larry Hogan enacts an emergency order to expand child care access for critical personnel while Maryland schools are closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

Gov. Larry Hogan enacted an emergency order to expand child care access for critical personnel while Maryland schools are closed during the coronavirus outbreak. ||READ THE FULL EMEREGENCY ORDER||On Saturday, Hogan announced the order will ensure child care services are available for providers of health care, emergency medical services and law enforcement personnel while schools are closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “Our state has taken major and unprecedented actions to protect the health, the safety, and the welfare of the people of Maryland,” said Hogan. “As we continue to operate under a state of emergency, we are committed to doing everything in our power to maintain our essential services, including child care, especially for those who are on the front lines helping us combat this public health threat.”On Thursday, state Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon announced that plans would be developed to ensure that the children of emergency services personnel have access to childcare throughout during a prolonged period of school closure. ||Timeline: Coronavirus in Maryland||Enhanced Guidelines for Child Care ProgramsSalmon issued enhanced guidelines for child care programs and day care facilities to follow to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Child care programs must take extraordinary precautions beyond what is normally recommended to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including:Mandating social distancing and keeping children in small groups (no more than 10 children clustered in an activity): absolutely no large group activities.Instructing staff to monitor for symptoms, and stay home if they are sick.Instructing parents/guardians to keep children home if they or any member of the household exhibits symptoms.Mandating frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing one’s nose. Teachers should help young children do the same. If hands are visibly dirty, use soap and water to clean hands.Providing children with soap and water to wash hands; adults may use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but this is very toxic to children.Advising persons to avoid touching their face (especially eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands).Increasing the early childhood program’s cleaning and disinfection routine to multiple times per day, while being careful with children in the near vicinity. Emphasizing cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. Covering coughs or sneezes with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash and cleaning hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer (if soap and water are not readily available).Providing adequate supplies for good hygiene, including clean and functional handwashing stations, soap, paper towels, and alcohol‐based hand sanitizer.Restricting field trips.Restricting outside visitors and volunteersSpecial processes beyond routine cleaning are not necessary nor recommended to slow the spread of respiratory illness. Programs should follow standard procedures for cleaning as recommended below by the Environmental Protection Agency. Typically, this means daily sanitizing surfaces and objects that are touched often, such as bathrooms, water coolers, desks, countertops, doorknobs, computer keyboards, hands‐on learning items, faucet handles, phones and toys.

When he went to break up the group, his left shoulder inadvertently brushed Abdullah's shoulder."Mr. Abdullah then states, 'The word is excuse me' and spits in Sgt. Simpson's face," the charging documents state.Charging documents state Simpson then tried to arrest Abdullah and things turned physical. Simpson was punched in the face and kicked. Then, the documents state, Burgess "assisted in assaulting Sgt. Simpson and trying to help Mr. Abdullah get away by pulling his arms and causing Sgt. Simpson to be drug across the concrete.""It talks about the lawlessness and it talks about the brazenness of the criminal offenders who have no respect for the law and no respect for authority," Harrison said.Simpson wasn't seriously hurt.The charging documents state that Abdullah said during the incident that he had trouble breathing. He was treated at the scene by a medic unit and declined to go to a hospital.A juvenile was also arrested over the weekend. Police said they are still looking for more people who were involved.             BALTIMORE

Maryland session to adjourn Wednesday amid State of Emergency
.W
Maryland legislators announced Sunday afternoon that the Maryland General Assembly with adjourn on Wednesday while coronavirus concerns grow.

Under the self-imposed deadline, lawmakers have until Wednesday to complete work on everything from the budget to education reform.  An early, but temporary finish line, the 2020 session officially ends April 6, but the coronavirus changed that timetable. Lawmakers will adjourn March 18 and resume the last week in May.  “We will be essentially condensing the last month of session into three days with a third of the staff.  This is going to require us to focus on the most important and prioritized policies,” Senate President Bill Ferguson said.Topping the list of priorities is passing the state's $47.9 billion budget. The spending plan is the only action that lawmakers are constitutionally required to complete during the legislative session. The Senate still needs to cast a final vote on a school construction bill. The plan provides $2.2 billion in funding for projects across the state.  The House and Senate still need to agree to changes made to the $4 billion Kirwan Education Bill. A Senate amendment, rejected earlier by the House, would reduce per-student spending to the rate of inflation, if by December state revenue drops 7.5% below estimates announced in March. This is being considered because of concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus.“This is a critical time in our state's government and a fragile moment in our effort to secure our state's public health,” said Speaker Adrienne Jones.Also pending approval is a package of bills to help pay for the education overhaul. This includes a tax on digital downloads and an increase in the tobacco tax. The House approved legislation to expand the sales tax lobbying, public relations and telemarketing services. Additional funding for historically black colleges got late final approval. The  legislation requires the governor to spend $580 million over the next ten years at the state’s four black institutions.“When we face a common enemy, we all pull together and we take care of what needs to get done,” said Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke.“We may be Republicans and Democrats, but today we are all Marylanders and we are going to get through this,” said Minority Leader Sen. J.B. JenningsA joint COVID-19 legislative work group is being created to monitor the virus in Maryland and make recommendations to lawmakers. Also in the name of transparency, the Senate will be video streaming floor and voting sessions. ​             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

An anonymous donor answered the ring of the Salvation Army bell with a ring of her own, bringing the organization closer to its goal this holiday season."It kind of just came out as a shock," Salvation Army Capt. Ryan Vincent said. "One of our staff members said that they gotten this donation out of the blue, and it was during intake that they noticed it. The kettle worker didn't even mention that she even seen the lady putting it in there."It was outside of a grocery store in Annapolis Tuesday when a woman put jewelry worth thousands inside the donation kettle."It was a big surprise, but definitely one that makes you feel good," Vincent said.Part of the donation was a Tiffany and Co. bracelet made of yellow gold valued at $6,000. It was sold for about a quarter of that price.But it doesn't stop there. The donation also included a ring and another bracelet that were a matching set of diamonds and rubies sold Saturday for almost $1,300."So, we're looking at probably around $12,000 worth of jewelry," Vincent said.With the money raised just from the anonymous donor's jewelry, Vincent said it allows his organization to feed needy local kids for at least a year."We do a warm meal with them just so they get a little bit what a family meal looks like," Vincent said. "I know this was a gift made with love.""That kind of gift speaks volumes to not only our mission and affirming what we're doing with our folks here, but also, what we're trying to do in our community."The donation amount is now set at $101,000, bringing the organization closer to its $120,000 goal.

In Howard County, first responders are suiting up a little differently now that after six officers are under quarantine after responding to a coronavirus case there.

In Howard County, first responders are suiting up a little differently now that after six officers are under quarantine after responding to a coronavirus case there. The firefighters and paramedic are isolated. They are quarantined at home. The patient is in a hospital, officials said. The incident caused Howard County and other communities to add new protocols to keep patients and first responders safe."We remain concerned whenever someone is impacted by COVID-19 or coronavirus," said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. Ball said he has talked to the firefighters and medic exposed to the virus.They were taking an 82-year-old woman, with an underlying medical condition from the Lorien nursing home in Elkridge to a hospital. How she contracted the virus is still under investigation. "That particular incident was not dispatched as a COVID patient. Our responders went in not in their normal PPE's as they would for that call personal protective equipment, so that is concerning to us," said acting fire Chief William Anuszewski.The incident has led to more protocols. First responders may now arrive wearing this: "It's a full face shield, under it a respirator mask, full gown and double gloves. The double gloves are for us so we can change our PPE without contaminating it with dirty gloves," said Anuszewski. The fire department is also trying to reduce risk by limiting the number of responders going into a room to assess a patient. ||Link: Maryland Department of Health on coronavirus||"Two responders actually enter the room. One within a six-foot radius, the other outside a six-foot radius so we can limit exposure until we know we need more help depending on the call type," said Anuszewski.Baltimore City Fire Chief Niles Ford is also strengthened protocols. He's telling his firefighters who come in contact with a suspected case of coronavirus what to wear. "They are required to wear gloves, and N95 masks prior to entering a home, nursing home facility or hospital," said Ford.Anne Arundel County fire officials told 11 News it has no new protocols, but it is following the guidance of the health department, including using eye protection, a mask, gloves and a gown.A spokesman said gloves and eye protection are used on all of their medical calls.

Baltimore City to partner with Lyft for Grocery Access Program
.W
Mayor Young partners with Lyft to start the Grocery Access Program for food desert areas in Baltimore.

Food deserts are a problem in Baltimore City. Many residents don't have access to affordable and nutritious food, but a new partnership is helping change that for some in west and south Baltimore. Access to fresh, affordable food is a problem for many in Baltimore City. One in four residents lives in a healthy food priority area, also known as a food desert, and many don't own a car. "You have a lot of convenience stores on the corners. As far as getting fresh fruits and stuff like that, this would be the only one that's close by," Price Rite shopper Lisa Burman said. "There's a lot of people with kids that don't have a way to the grocery store, and they have to catch a cab or bus," Price Rite shopper Cynthia Parker said. There's now another option, thanks to the Baltimore Grocery Access pilot program, which is funded for the next six months with grant money. Two hundred people in west and south Baltimore can apply online to take part in the program."You can use it on your phone or at your home, so you can go to the library to be able to access the internet and what we know is the majority of people do have access to the internet, on one of those mechanisms," said Holly Freishtat, director of the Baltimore City Food Policy. Once in the program, residents will get Lyft rides to and from a participating grocery store for $2.50 each way, up to four round trips per month. Residents said it's something they will use."Sure, especially on days when I have to come and get a lot and on my monthly shopping, yes I would," Burman said. "It will help a lot of people, especially the elderly or disabled," Price Rite shopper Marsha Diggs said. The Baltimore Development Corporation and South Baltimore Gateway Partnership will help connect those who need it with the program. If the pilot is successful, they'd like to expand it to other areas of the city, giving more residents equal opportunity to nutritious food. "We want to give them the mobility, flexibility and accessibility to access the foods they'd like to access," Freishtat said.The BDC is also working to bring more grocery stores into those areas designated as food deserts in the city.Participating West Baltimore stores include: •Save A Lot (250 McMechen Street)•Shoppers (2000 Gwynns Falls Parkway)•Save A Lot (3427 Clifton Avenue)•Giant #317 (4624 Edmondson Avenue)•Food Depot (2495 Frederick Avenue)•Price Rite (1205 W. Pratt Street)•Streets Market & Cafe (222 N. Charles Street)•Eddie’s of Mt. Vernon (7 W. Eager Street)•Save A Lot (1101 Pennsylvania Avenue)•Safeway (2401 N.

Fort Avenue)•Harris Teeter (1801 Whetstone Way)•MegaMart (3400 Annapolis Road)) - coming soon  Registration for the program opens on Nov. 18. West and south Baltimore residents who meet the following criteria are eligible to participate in the Grocery Access Program.West Baltimore: Participants must reside within the boundary of West North Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, West Mulberry Street, West Franklin Street, Edmondson Avenue and Hilton Parkway. They must not have access to a personal vehicle.South Baltimore: Participants must reside in the Cherry Hill, Lakeland or Westport neighborhoods.Prospective participants can register at lyft.com/city/grocery-access/baltimore-md.

Bars and restaurants are now closed in Maryland for the time being. Business owners and patrons now have to make new plans.Businesses at The Avenue Monday night didn't look anything like it normally does.Owners are concentrating on pushing their carryout and take-out options, just hoping it's enough to keep them in business. It's the type of business all restaurants are going to have to get used to -- customers calling in, lining up and carrying out.The parking lot at Jimmy's Seafood in South East Baltimore has been very busy. "I'm here to get some dinner, just get some sushi and just try to get through it, you know," said customer, Lauren Ziolkowski. "Today, when I realized they were closing, I made plans in my mind to get dinner for tonight," said another customer Vearnol Hazel.Business owners and patrons found out Monday morning about the restaurant and bar 5 p.m. shutdown Monday morning. Managers at City Cafe in Midtown are not at all used to managing an empty restaurant. "We're working with a very limited staff today and we're just trying to get to the people who don't normally cook at home," said City Café general manager Corey Liberatore.After the announcement, some people we're determined to soak up every last minute of restaurant time.Others told 11 News that at least part of their day was spent shopping and planning."I went to the grocery store and got a bunch of stuff, and I'm just going to be microwaving that for the next few weeks," said Cameron Briggs. "Just going to try to stay home -- (my) girlfriend went to the grocery store, picked up the necessities just going to hunker down for a bit," said Chris Bressi. Under Gov. Larry Hogan's order, carryout and drive through is fine.It took little time for delivery driver Wayne Harle to realize he's going to log a lot of miles. "I'm up at 100 in tips now already, normally 75 dollars," said Harle. Just about every restaurant owner 11 News talked with said they know they just have to take it day by day, see what business is like and adjust as needed. But that is hard, not knowing how long all of this will last.             BALTIMORE

With shoppers clearing out shelves in grocery stores, some people are going alternative routes to find the food they need in stock.

With shoppers clearing out shelves in grocery stores, some people are going alternative routes to find the food they need in stock.As more and more grocery stores are having trouble keeping their shelves stocked with meat, specialty stores like Wagner's Meats in Mt. Airy are seeing a business boom but it comes with a price."I appreciate the business, but the panic just scares me a little bit," said Mickey Wagner. Wagner's grandfather started Wagner's Meats in Mt. Airy in 1953. He said his family has never seen anything like the response from shoppers since the coronavirus outbreak."We’re seeing a lot of new faces that we haven’t seen before and people are buying a lot of stuff," said Wagner. What started out as kind of a joke with toilet paper shelves empty in grocery and big box store, then hand sanitizer and soaps has now made its way to the meat aisles and when people can't find the meat they want, that's where stores like Wagner's come in."I don’t think there’s really any reason to panic. People act like the stores are going to closing next week and that’s not the case," Wagner said. "It’s better safe than sorry, you know? I don’t believe that this is as bad as they’re making it out to be so, better safe than sorry though," said shopper James Hardy. Customers we spoke with seemed relieved they had other options, like Wagner's, but for the most part agree there is no need to panic shop and to leave some for your neighbors."I'm trying to buy what I need and it’s hard to fight that urge to want to buy more, that’s what I think we all have to do come together as a community, said shopper Becky Kidwell.People at Wagner's said they’re hoping just like everyone else this is over sooner than later and remind folks there will always be plenty of meat to go around.

Health officials in Chicago said a woman in her 60s traveling from China is the second person in the U.S. to become sick with coronavirus."This is a single travel-associated case, not a local emergency. We, obviously, take emerging viruses very seriously, and there are still many unanswered questions about this novel virus," Chicago Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said.There are at least 60 possible cases in the U.S. that are under investigation.For the first time, the deadly virus is making an appearance in Europe. Health officials in France reported three people tested positive for the virus.The outbreak has officials in China on heightened alert. Tourist destinations like Shanghai Disney are shut down, and 10 cities near the city of Wuhan shut down their transportation. Wuhan is considered the center of the outbreak.Symptoms of infection with this novel coronavirus include:FeverCoughShortness of BreathPeople who have traveled to China in the last 14 days and have a fever and cough or shortness of breath, should:Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.Avoid contact with others.Avoid further travel until the illness resolves.Wear a mask if you need to leave the house when sick.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.Dr. Elizabeth Wang, an infectious disease doctor at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Towson, said there is still no reason for alarm."I would not panic about it," Wang said.Wang told 11 News that this year's flu season is far more concerning."If you check the CDC's website, it estimates that there has been 8,000 cases of flu death thus far in the season, so I would say I think, really, right now, the bigger threat is influenza rather than the new coronavirus," Wang said.Hospitals and medical centers across Maryland have started several precautions, including travel screening for new patients."If they've traveled to Wuhan, China, if they’ve come in to close contact with anyone who traveled to China recently, and we actually have designated algorithms should we identify these folks, we have negative pressure rooms to quarantine them in," Wang said.Ultimately, Wang said it's best to protect yourself whenever possible, just like when dealing with the common cold and flu."Things like wearing a mask in public places if you’re a immune-compromised, stay away from people who are obviously sick or coughing, and one last thing is good hand hygiene," Wang said.Wang also told 11 News that doctors are not yet that concerned about a pandemic because those who have died after contracting coronavirus had compromised immune systems.There are currently no vaccines able to protect humans against this coronavirus, so health officials said the best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus. Everyday preventative actions that can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses include:Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least      20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand      sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed      hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.             TOWSON, Md.

If you haven't gotten your shopping done by now, then just forget it. We're talking about shopping for that favorite gift or last-minute item for your holiday meal.

If you haven't gotten your shopping done by now, then just forget it.We're talking about shopping for that favorite gift or last-minute item for your holiday meal.As far as last-minute gifts, 11 News found plenty of people out and about Christmas Eve and as anyone might guess, the hottest gift around here is anything Baltimore Ravens-related.At the Baltimore Sports and Novelty store in Owings Mills, Baltimore Ravens gear is flying off the shelves."Last day of Christmas, last-minute gifts, we're selling Lamar Jackson name and number T-shirts because we don’t have the jerseys net, hats or scarves. Anything Ravens is selling today," said Jeffrey Katzen, with Baltimore Sports & Novelty.Those Lamar jerseys are a tough item to find, unless you're a toddler or an infant, where those sizes are still available. Nonetheless, shoppers were making out just fine."This is pretty much my go-to store anytime I need something purple and black, and I’m a last-minute dude. I can’t lie," last-minute shopper Brian Ellis said. Bikes are also a very popular gift to give this year, and people at Race Pace Bicycles said there were plenty of last-minute sales."You still see people looking for presents for their kids, so we’re seeing bikes for children under 15 years old. It’s very common," Kevin Doland said. And then there's the grocery Store. The Wegmans in Owings Mills is packed with shoppers getting those last-minute food items for holiday feasts or, in Dennis Myers' case, shopping for his daughter who just got home from college."We usually don’t wait till the last minute, but because we picked her up last night from the airport, we decided to let her pick out what she wanted to eat today, so that’s why we're here," Myers said.Now that the shopping is done, we can brace for Dec. 26, the day after Christmas and all of the returns.

GiGi's Playhouse in Annapolis serves people with Down syndrome of all ages and their families. It had to make the hard decision to close amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The coronavirus is hitting non-profits hard. Many have had to cancel or reschedule their fundraisers. GiGi's Playhouse in Annapolis serves people with Down syndrome of all ages and their families. It had to make the hard decision to close amid the coronavirus outbreak.You can instantly feel the love at the down-syndrome enrichment center."It sort of feels like there's a vacuum, like, life has been sucked out of experience, because we were coming together supporting each other," said manager Judy Coe. "It's a place where people can come together and have a shared experience and follow a journey together."Instead of offering programs, workers are cleaning. GiGi's Playhouse is temporarily closed. It was a tough, but necessary decision, especially after doing research. "Approximately 50% of our population has some sort of heart issue... Whether it's been repaired or not, they can still be at risk. And in addition to that, there are a lot of autoimmune disorders that come with Down syndrome," said president Kim Eckert.Everything is free at GiGi's and it had to keep the health of its volunteers in mind. "A lot of (the volunteers) are over 70. Especially with our literacy and math tutoring, there's no way they could keep that 6 foot distance, the social distance," Eckert said.In addition, it was supposed to hold its annual gala this weekend. It's the biggest fundraiser of the year and pays for things like rent and utilities.In the meantime, employees hope their families are using the resources they've provided."I just miss everybody so much and I can't wait till were all together again. I love you all so much," Coe said.             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

Baltimore City, Harford County declare states of emergency amid coronavirus outbreak

Baltimore City and Harford County are the latest Maryland jurisdictions to declare local states of emergency as the number of confirmed cases continues to grow to 85 statewide as of Wednesday afternoon.

Baltimore City and Harford County are the latest Maryland jurisdictions to declare local states of emergency as the number of confirmed cases continues to grow to 85 statewide as of Wednesday afternoon.Two of the 85 cases sickened by the virus in Maryland are hospital providers. One of those providers works at LifeBridge Health's Northwest Hospital, and the other is at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Both are under quarantined.Hospital officials told 11 News there is also a patient at Sinai Hospital who has coronavirus. The patient is doing well, and the hospital is following all necessary protocols.In response to the governor's push to increase the availability of hospital beds, Mercy Medical Center will construct a new hospital floor to add 32 additional beds to the downtown Baltimore facility.The Mount Vernon Place Conservancy announced Wednesday that Flower Mart at Mount Vernon Place, has been cancelled. The event was scheduled for April 30-May 1. Lance Humphries, the executive director of the Conservancy, said the decision to cancel the event over the weekend based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s initial recommendations to avoid gatherings larger than 250 people in order to help contain the spread of COVID-19.“Although we are cancelling Flower Mart, when the time is right, we hope to be able to do something extra special in Mount Vernon Place for the public to enjoy," Humphries said.Baltimore City is dealing with new cases of coronavirus.The city's new cases of people with the coronavirus includes three patients in their 20s.There are now five confirmed cases in the city, but there's been little testing so it's expected those numbers will rise as testing becomes more available.A Wednesday morning briefing provided a real-time lesson in social distancing from the Baltimore City Health commissioner, Dr. Letitia Dzirasa.As she took the podium, Dzirasa asked her fellow Cabinet members to move apart.“As your health commissioner I have to ask to move this group to my left to spread out. It is making me nervous. Six feet. Because that is the message we want to promote,” Dzirasa said.Social distancing is said to be the most important thing people can do to stop the spread of the coronavirus.The city's Board of Estimates blocked off seats to keep members of the public apart. but the members on the board sat in their usual seats nearly elbow to elbow.Young declared a state of emergency, mostly to allow the city to buy supplies needed to deal with the pandemic without going through the normal process. The city has procured hotel rooms, for example, to house homeless people who may be sick but not in need of hospitalization.“We are doing everything we can to make sure people in the city remain calm and also take this seriously,” Young said.All five of the city's coronavirus cases are related to community transmission.“Very generally because we want to protect the privacy of those patients. So five confirmed cases. One is an adult in their 60s, one is an older adult in their 70s and the other three are younger adults in their 20s,” Dzirasa said.City Solicitor Dana Moore said the city is prepared to get a court order to isolate confirmed patients who may not cooperate with the restrictions.“If there are members of the community identified as active COVID-19 or having been exposed that need to be removed from the community and they don't want to voluntarily, we have already prepared paperwork to make sure that happens,” Moore said.The City Economic Development Chief Colin Tarbert provided a snapshot of the economic harm to the city, with businesses reporting they may lay off up to a third of their employees if this continues for long. Hardest hit are restaurants, bars and personal services, all subject to the Gov. Larry Hogan’s order to close.“Overall, businesses report an average of a 65% decline in revenue, but many are completely shut down. Based on the survey businesses anticipate having to reduce their employees by a third of this continues much longer. Many have already laid off workers,” Tarbert said.  ​             BALTIMORE

Maryland National Guard members transported recently quarantined passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship after their arrival at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on Tuesday.

Maryland National Guard members transported recently quarantined passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship after their arrival at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on Tuesday. According to officials with the MNG, eight airmen with the Maryland Air National Guard’s 175th Wing and medical specialists with the Maryland Department of Health, transported nine passengers from BWI-Marshall to their homes in Maryland.Officials said the airmen also brought food and essential supplies to allow the passengers to self-quarantine for at least two weeks.“This is just another example of Marylanders helping their fellow Marylanders throughout this crisis situation,” said Army Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen, the adjutant general for Maryland. “The Maryland National Guard is here to help our neighbors wherever and however we can.”The passengers, who were transported to a number of locations across Maryland, were provided with contact information in case they need additional supplies or show symptoms of COVID-19, officials said.Gov. Larry Hogan activated the MNG last Thursday.Earlier this week, 1,000 MNG members reported to their units to support Maryland residents. Another 1,200 members will be in a state of enhanced readiness, officials said.Maryland National Guard capabilities could include medical augmentation, transportation support, food distribution and more.Guard senior leaders and emergency managers are working in close coordination with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency and other civil authorities to determine where and what capabilities the Maryland Guard can provide.

An Anne Arundel County woman is one of more than 1,000 Americans who got stuck in Peru when the country closed its borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates ||Tyra Little, 19, is friends with a classmate at Anne Arundel Community College who is an exchange student from Peru. She and another friend decided to visit her there over spring break, but it's a trip that has turned into a nightmare."I'm just hoping I get home sooner than what they're saying," Little said.Last Thursday, Little left for her first international trip as an adult. She and a friend headed for Peru. Her parents were a bit worried about the spreading coronavirus."We really did have concerns, but they're both adults, so you can't really stop their movement that much," said Maria Little, Tyra Little's mother.Tyra Little was supposed to fly back home Tuesday but got word her flight had been canceled. Peru shut down its borders to stop the virus. She went to the airport but couldn't book another flight."It was just mass hysteria at the airport. It was just crazy. There was nothing she could do," Maria Little said.Since then, Tyra Little has been hunkered down at the home of her exchange student friend, Facetiming with her mom and family members -- safe, but in quarantine."There's not really much to do. We've been able to go out once a day for about maybe 20 minutes to go to the market and get food, but that's about it," Tyra Little said.Maria Little contacted the U.S. embassy, to no avail. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said those stuck in Peru will get help from the military to them get home. Maria Little hopes that's true and she'll get to hug her daughter again soon. Tyra Little said this is her last trip for a while."I'm going to stay home for the next couple of years. Yeah, it's a lot for me. I probably won't leave out of the country in a while," Tyra Little said.As of Thursday, Peru's borders were set to reopen in a couple of weeks.

Arlinda and Willie Peyton booked a cruise on the Grand Princess to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, but the last leg of their voyage turned into uncharted territory.

Arlinda and Willie Peyton booked a cruise on the Grand Princess to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary, but the last leg of their voyage turned into uncharted territory. The outbreak of the coronavirus on board quarantined the ship.“We stayed in our rooms. They delivered meals. You swapped out your linens, they took your trash, you put everything outside your cabin,” said Arlinda Peyton. “They tried to do things to keep us entertained. Dropping off puzzles and kits to make jewelry, Soddukp, you know. They put more movies in the TV -- that type of thing."Their original port of San Francisco wouldn't let them in, so the Peytons spent five days at sea. Arlinda Peyton recalls 19 crew members and two passengers tested positive.“That whole confinement for a boatload of people going on a vacation was just so wrong. They should have just let the Princess get us off the ship. They should have had airplanes waiting (to) let us get back to our states and take us home and go from there. But they didn't do that,” she said.Eventually, Oakland let them in, and the couple were sent to Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia to quarantine.“You had to beg, borrow and plead for stuff,” Arlinda Peyton said.They stayed in a two-room suite, but she said there was no information provided, no testing and the military could not help them get prescription refills.“I went down there and beat on the fence, somebody comes out, I tell them what I need, he kind of saunters away. I said, ‘Look, I got to have this or I'm coming over that fence.’ I was just pissed,” she said.Arlinda Peyton coordinated a medication drop-off through her daughter. She said her ordeal was an eye-opener.“People just do not use good sense. People do not have good manners anymore. Everything is about me, me, me. They don't think about their fellow man,” she said. “We need to get back to being friends to one another and we need to get back to a village raising a child and having more community.”The Peytons reached out to Gov. Larry Hogan’s office for help. They traded information. They credit Hogan for getting them home.             BALTIMORE

Limitations on public transit across Maryland impact residents who depend on it

Gov. Larry Hogan wants to severely limit the use of public transit in the state, a decision that set off alarms among transit advocates and caused confusion at transit stops.

Gov. Larry Hogan wants to severely limit the use of public transit in the state, a decision that set off alarms among transit advocates and caused confusion at transit stops.Earlier in the week, Hogan tried to cut transit service, then backed off a bit. Now he's directing people to stay off the systems with just a few exceptions.Marion Watts has no car -- the bus is his lifeline. So he was worried Thursday morning when Hogan directed a dramatic reduction in who should use the transit system.“When I heard it this morning, I was like, ‘Did i just hear him say…?’ But no one did a follow-up on it," Watts said.“No one, no one, should get on a MARC train, metro, Amtrak or bus or any of our transportation assets unless you are an emergency personnel, a front line health care provider or your job is essential to the supply chain,” said Hogan.Transit equity advocates said safe spacing on buses and trains can be achieved if employers stagger start times on work shifts, as opposed to shutting off access to people who need transit the most.“When we do that, we can reduce crowding on the morning and afternoon rush hours by stretching that use and start times for transit-dependent workers over the course of the work day,” said transit equity advocate Samuel Jordan. “The governor's directives are heaping a greater burden upon the transit-dependent, which means majority people of color and low-income households that are transit dependent than he has on the rest of the population.”“How important is the bus to me? Oh it's very important. I need that for transportation to travel from one place to another. It's very important because I don't own a car,” said Debbie, a bus commuter, who declined to give her last name.A gubernatorial spokesman told 11 News the Hogan's statements about who should use public transit were a recommendation. He said no one would be denied access.             BALTIMORE

Baltimore County police update procedures amid coronavirus concerns

The Baltimore County Police Department is taking proactive steps to keep the public and officers safe in the wake the coronavirus pandemic.

The Baltimore County Police Department is taking proactive steps to keep the public and officers safe in the wake the coronavirus pandemic. “This is definitely an evolving situation and we are learning things every day,” said Baltimore County police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “I take the safety of our officers very seriously.”Hyatt has been using social media and YouTube as additional ways to keep the public and her own department informed about new COVID-19 protocols.Now, officers will be also able to take some reports by phone in every precinct.“One of the things that we’ve added to our 911 protocol when somebody calls for police services is, if the person is able to walk outside and to meet the officers, that’s what we are requesting them to do,” Hyatt said.Officers like officers Trae Lindsay and Chideya Thompson have been issued protective gear to wear. Don’t be surprised if you see officers look different, depending on the nature of the call.“Wearing a mask to protect ourselves and everyone else. Any germs that we might have or might catch,” Lindsay said.The police department also launched its Incident Management Team which is operating daily to monitor equipment needs, staffing requirements, plans for contamination of the cabins and more.As Gov. Larry Hogan calls for more actions to reduce the spread of the virus, Hyatt said it will absolutely make their job easier.“Because when we are out there, right now, there are still a lot of people are out and about and this is a serious situation. Just like we are working to keep our officers safe as possible, we want the public to be a smart and safe as possible, which means when they can stay home,” Hyatt said.​             BALTIMORE COUNTY, Md.

UMMS updates visitor restrictions at all system hospitals, facilities
.W
Following the first confirmed coronavirus-related death in Maryland, The University of Maryland Medical System updated visitor restrictions at all 13 System hospitals and other UMMS healthcare facilities.

Following the first confirmed coronavirus-related death in Maryland, The University of Maryland Medical System updated visitor restrictions at all 13 system hospitals and other UMMS healthcare facilities.As of Thursday night, Maryland recorded over 100 confirmed coronavirus cases, an 88% increase since Tuesday. Under the Strict Patient Safety Policy, beginning Friday at 3 p.m, UMMS said there will be no visitors allowed, except under specific circumstances, and by prior approval of a physician administrative officer or their designee.The policy applies to all patients within UMMS hospitals and other facilities. It is also in alignment with Johns Hopkins Medicine and is consistent with approaches taken by other leading health care institutions nationwide.“Due to rapid escalation of COVID cases across Maryland and increased community spread of the disease, we have decided to enact this more aggressive and comprehensive, systemwide policy, which will be in effect until further notice,” said Dr. David Marcozzi, COVID-19 Incident Commander for UMMS.Exceptions to the Strict Patient Safety Policy include:For in-patient facilities:End-of-life care or end of life decision making.  For these situations, two visitors will be permitted.One parent or caregiver of a child in the neonatal intensive care unit One parent or caregiver of pediatric patients as long as theyare not symptomaticOne visitor inclusive of a professional support person or postpartum helper of a patient in the labor and delivery and the postpartum unitsOne visitor for patients in inpatient hospice unitsOne visitor to accompany patients for hospital dischargeOne visitor for patients undergoing emergency surgeryVisitors who have been asked by the patient’s care team to be a part of scheduled family training for patients with rehabilitation needs.For all outpatient appointments:One visitor will be permitted to accompany a patient to facilitate care or treatment such as an ambulatory visit, procedure or same-day surgeryUMMS experts urge the public to practice vigilant hand hygiene, follow respiratory etiquette (cover mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing), maintain social distances when possible and avoid shaking hands.

USM: Students to finish classes online; no in-person commencements ceremonies
.W
Over 100,000 students who attend schools in the University System of Maryland will be finishing the spring semester online.

Over 100,000 students who attend schools in the University System of Maryland will be finishing the spring semester online.After Gov. Larry Hogan strongly urged higher education leaders to make the call, USM Chancellor Jay A. Perman announced Thursday night that all undergraduate face-to-face instruction will move to remote instruction for the rest of the semester. "It will be up to presidents, provosts, deans and department heads to work out detailed plans that allow students to complete their work and to fulfill all of their requirements. I believe this is important not only for our institutions but for our students themselves, who should be assured that they did the work—and successfully demonstrated the knowledge and skills—that their courses required," Perman said. Perman also addressed commencement ceremonies among USM schools. "It’ll come as no surprise that USM universities will not be holding traditional, in-person commencement ceremonies. I’ve encouraged universities to be creative in how they celebrate their graduates. Many are talking about celebrating in a virtual environment. I’d certainly also support in-person commencement gatherings once this period of COVID-19 threat has lifted," he said.Perman said the universities are united in their support of refunding room and board on a prorated basis. "We have good guidance from the federal government that financial aid packages will not  be affected by a refund on room and board. This means that students receiving financial aid should not have that aid reduced or clawed back because of these refunds," he said. "We recommend, as well, prorated refunds of various university fees. In the short term, we think students and families should be able to know how much money is coming back to them through these refunds, and our campuses are working on how we might do that."Other colleges/universities across MarylandStudents 11 News spoke with said they had a hunch this was going to happen. Some of them were away on spring break, and others were just returning to campus.“We were, like, all texting each other trying to figure out what was going on,” said Johns Hopkins University student Christina Boatwright.Boatwright, just arrived back from California, only to get word she may have to start repacking.“I am just currently staying here, kind of trying to figure out how online classes will go or if I should go home and do classes there or stay here. They closed the library and everything. So we are just kind of figuring out where to study and how to get school done,” said Boatwright.And that's what students are facing across the state.“We saw it coming for a while now, but it is pretty shocking that it would happen at the same time. A lot of us are trying to get our heads wrapped around it,” said JHU student Jessica Long.Arie Zdziera is a nursing student at the Community College of Baltimore County. She's dealing with a much different set of circumstances.“Nursing is very rigorous, which means we have days to complete things. We have hours of clinical time that needs to be done in the hospital and in the lab that needs to be done in order for us to graduate on time,” said Zdziera.Morgan State University, a school outside of the USM, made the call to switch to online courses a day earlier.Hogan's mandate comes a week after Towson University students were told to move out of on-campus housing three days ahead of time.You can expect individual schools to make public how students who have paid for things like housing and meals for the semester will be compensated.

Hogan signs emergency COVID-19 legislation as 5-year-old tests positive
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday that the state has reached 107 positive cases of coronavirus. One of the cases includes a 5-year-old girl from Howard County - the first confirmed case for a child in Maryland.

Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday that the state has reached 107 positive cases of the coronavirus. One of the cases includes a 5-year-old girl from Howard County -- the first confirmed case for a child in Maryland.|| Latest coronavirus updates ||"This is truly is one of the most daunting challenges that our state has ever faced," Hogan said.The girl is a student at Elkridge Elementary School. She's recovering at home and health officials said others at the school are not at risk, Howard County officials announced in the afternoon."Among today's new cases is a 5-year-old girl in Howard County, who tested positive for coronavirus -- the first case of a child contracting the disease in Maryland," Hogan said.While leaders said the 5-year-old girl was not exposed to any students or staff at Elkridge Elementary School, local leaders are calling for new changes to slow down the spread of the virus."And it's just the concern. There's a lot of questions,” said resident Karen Kushman.Residents in a small community, down the road from Elkridge Elementary School, were startled by the news that it was a student diagnosed with the coronavirus."There's tons of neighbors who do have kids that go to this school,” said Kushman."As awful as it is, you hear that there's one group of people that get this the most and you're, like, ‘Whew, OK, I'm not in that group.’ And then you hear another and you're, like, ‘Oh I'm not in that group,’ but as you see more groups, age groups get it, you kind of think, ‘Whew this could really happen,’” said resident Tania Arabian. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball enacted new measures to keep the spread under control by closing park gates and urging people to keep off of playgrounds."We're united in a singular focus -- public safety. And, we're taking these steps for a singular reason and that's to save lives,” Ball said.It's a move residents hope could help as they adjust to a new normal, brought on by coronavirus that apparently is hitting people no matter the age."It is sad to hear that a child has it. I will pray for her and hopefully she has a 100% recovery and is able to get back to usual things as soon as possible,” said Arabian."I have been in touch with the principal. We will be reaching out to the Elkridge Elementary School families and staff via e-mails, and we have spoken with the family of the student directly," Howard County Public Schools Superintendent Michael Martirano said.Martirano said during the time of school closures, all of the schools in the Howard County Schools district are being cleaned and disinfected.On Wednesday, the state confirmed its first death caused by coronavirus."This man was infected with the virus through community transmission," Hogan said. "And while this was the first death here in Maryland, it unfortunately won't be the last."During his briefing Thursday morning, Hogan said there was an 88% increase in confirmed cases in 48 hours. He provided multiple new guidelines and executive orders, including:Shopping malls and entertainment spaces will be closed starting at 5 p.m. ThursdayGatherings of more than 10 people are prohibitedEnclosed malls and entertainment venues are ordered to close at 5 p.m. Thursday.The Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport terminal will be limited to ticketed guests only and those who are needed to assist them, in addition to airport workersPublic transportation will be limited to essential personnel onlyThe state has activated phase one of the hospital surge plan: 900 beds are available immediately and 1,400 more will be available by early April, which also allows more flexibility for EMTs to augment health providers.The University System of Maryland Board of Regents will be asked to have college students finish their semester remotelyAn executive order has been issued to allow carry-out and delivery of alcohol from bars and restaurants, distilleries, breweries and wineries to support local small businesses and encourage people to stay home and avoid crowding in storesThe state has launched the Maryland Unites website to highlight acts of compassion and generosity and to allow people to find opportunities to volunteer and help."We are doing this to help small businesses and restaurants and to protect vulnerable people from having to leave home," Hogan said.The governor has activated the National Guard to transport patients, move medical supplies and more."A lot of transportation right now, required to distribute things like the strategic national stockpile distribution when that's ready to go," said Maj. Gen. Timothy Gowen, adjutant general of Maryland.The governor on Thursday signed the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Protection Act of 2020, which establishes a series of protections for individuals directly affected by COVID-19 or more broadly impacted by the state of emergency, including empowering the governor to:Prohibit cost-sharing by an insurance carriers for COVID-19 testing and associated costsEstablish or waive telehealth protocolsRequire carriers and Medicaid to cover a COVID-19 immunization (should one be developed) and any associated costs, without cost-sharing, for certain patientsWork with Maryland Department of Health (MDH), the Maryland Insurance Commissioner, and the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to minimize disruption in enrollment in health insurance and MedicaidAllow MDH to offer more flexibility in staffing during the state of emergencyProhibit employers from terminating an employee solely on the basis that the employee has been required to be isolated or quarantined or if the individual leaves employment due to a risk of exposure or infection COVID–19 or to care for a family member due to COVID-19Provides flexibility to the Secretary of Labor to allow workers who have not been terminated to collect unemployment insurance if their employer has been closed due to COVID-19, if they have been quarantined, or if they are caring for a family member who is quarantinedThe governor's office said the act also prohibits retailers from unfair price gouging for essential goods like food, fuel, medicine, medical supplies and cleaning products, and affirms that such action is subject to the enforcement by the attorney general.Hogan also announced he has five recommendations for the president, the vice president and the federal administration, which are as follows:Giving local government the maximum flexibility for National GuardProving guidance on the Defense Production ActDelaying and providing flexibility for the 2020 Census and transition to Real ID Supplementing funding directly to statesIncreasing access to and production of personal protective equipment, testing kits, etc.RAW VIDEO: Gov. Hogan's press conference in its entiretyWhile some parents may find the news unsettling, Sinai Hospital's vice chair of pediatrics, Dr. Scott Krugman, said there are probably hundreds of kids walking around with COVID-19 at this time because children are not being tested. He said parents should not panic, but be prepared."The first thing with kids, they are much less at risk for severe disease than adults are, especially the elderly," Krugman said.Krugman said parents should take precautions if they think their child is sick."If your kid has a cold, assume they have coronavirus. Keep them at home. Do not take them anywhere, don't take them out, don't take them on play dates, do not bring them to the emergency room, don't run to the doctor's office -- call first," Krugman said.Krugman said children who have no symptoms can still be active."We need kids to go outside and play, but we need to not have groups of kids together, so having your child or your family go to the park to take a walk, take a hike, absolutely do that," Krugman said.Just remember to keep a safe distance of 6 feet away from others, and don't congregate with other people.Krugman added that parents who have a child is who returning home from a college or from a place where there have been a bunch of cases, like abroad, New York, Washington state and California, to self-quarantine."They should be at home and self-quarantined for 14 days. If they have no symptoms after 14 days, you can be pretty confident they have not bring anything into your house," Krugman said.Howard County officials have closed all playgrounds and locked park gates, but there are still places for people to ride bikes and walk.VIDEO: Doctor to parents: Take precautions for children             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

The Maryland National Guard is working to establish a pilot health-screening location outside FedEx Field in Prince George's County.

The Maryland National Guard is working to assist Baltimore with serving vulnerable populations, Mayor Jack Young said. In a state released late Friday, Young: “My administration requested that the Guard deploy in Baltimore to provide humanitarian assistance in partnership with our city agencies as we work to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Guard's deployment helps provide resources we need to support the work being done to keep Baltimore healthy.”"The National Guard will be stationed to help support meal distribution at school sites throughout Baltimore, feeding children through the program begun earlier this week and led by staff from the Mayor’s Office of Children and Family Success, the Department of Planning and the Department of Recreation and Parks. The guard will also provide aid in planning and logistical support for the city’s hospitals and medical teams."“I am confident that the deployment of the National Guard will help ensure Baltimore City has everything it needs to fully address COVID-19. I would like to thank Governor Hogan for working closely with."The MNG is also helping to establish a pilot health-screening location outside FedEx Field in Prince George's County.Officials said the program is in collaboration with the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine.The goal is create locations where people can get health screenings and on-site testing."At the direction of Gov. Hogan, the Maryland National Guard and the Maryland Department of Health are establishing a pilot health screening location at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland," a National Guard official said in a statement sent to 11 News.

There is a lot of mobilizing happening all over Baltimore as people deal with the coronavirus outbreak, staying healthy and helping the community.WBAL-TV 11 News met with organizers who are seeking to help people who can't help themselves.Neighbors helping neighbors is a theme, and organizers said it as a necessity not an option.Coordinators Michaela Lindahl and Richard Bruno are walking through their Wyman Park neighborhood, dropping off information about essential resources.A support network of volunteers who residents might not need yet, but chances are they could in the near future."We definitely have seniors at risk and families that need to quarantine and health care workers that are looking for child care connections,” said Lindahl."This is a way for neighbors to say, 'Look, we're going to be here for you. We’re going to get groceries, we'll drop off your medications and walk your dog -- make sure everything is OK with you,’" said Bruno.They're called Baltimore Neighborhood Quarantine Response teams.Organizers are gathering a list of volunteers now, in nearly 20 neighborhoods in Baltimore City and matching them up with residents, following coronavirus quarantine and distancing guidelines."We've been working to clear and vet all of our volunteers so that as we ramp up with more requests for need we can match them,” said Lindahl.At the same time another Baltimore program is focusing specifically on medical workers, busy in emergency rooms and ICUs, who need help with things at home as the outbreak continues.Laura Pugh and Leslie Gailloud are two of the 250 University of Maryland and Hopkins Medical students already signed up to volunteer."We've definitely had some requests come through for the child care and most of our focus now is really focused on outreach to different providers,” Gailloud said.The goal, all the way around, is to help out as many people as possible provide some calm during an uncertain time."And we want more neighborhoods to be involved. There are hundreds of neighborhoods in this city we want everyone to be able to apply it,” Bruno said.We have a link to more information about how you can help or get help from the response teams, here.For medical students who want to help with the health care workers assistance program, click here.

Hogan: Spring breakers self-quarantine for 2 weeks
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has asked anyone who participated in spring break to voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days and to avoid anyone over the age of 60.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan sent out additional guidance Friday concerning precautions to be taken during the state of emergency over coronavirus concerns.|| Late-breaking coronavirus information ||Hogan is leading Maryland's response to the pandemic and is focusing full time on cutting the infection rate and saving lives.Hogan said the first infant case and the first teenager case of positively tested coronavirus are part of the latest statewide count of 149 positive cases. Hogan said two-thirds of all cases are between the ages of 18-64. No children under the age of 18 have been hospitalized, the governor said.The governor also issued a strongly worded message Friday afternoon, urging people to "avoid crowds at all cost" and stay away from playgrounds and pavilions. The governor warned: "If you ignore this recommendation, you are endangering yourself and the health of others."Hogan has asked anyone who participated in spring break to voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days and to avoid anyone over the age of 60."Even though students are not returning to campus, this should not in any way be treated as an extension of your spring break. If you ignore this recommendation, you are endangering yourself and the health of others," Hogan said.With the warm weather, Hogan is urging those who go outside to avoid crowds,  areas with 10 or more people, playground and pavilions."If every single Marylander steps up and does their part by making sacrifices now, it will slow the spread of this virus and save lives," Hogan said.Friday also brought a new tax deadline, pushed from April 15 to July 15 to file federal and state returns.Federal disaster aid has been freed up for Maryland businesses that are struggling to stay afloat amid the pandemic. Business owners know that in order to save lives, they may have to close.Comptroller Peter Franchot said he's talking with the administration about a possible bank holiday."Like a tornado at night, it's going to tear through our state, but we have to realize that after the tornado comes through is going to be tremendous economic damage to the state in its aftermath," Franchot said.Business owners told 11 News they are waiting for a potential closure order and wondering if they'll be able to come back."Hopefully, it'll end soon and we will find some medicine to fix this, but this is going to hurt everybody," said Eugenie Baghdadlian, with Cezanne Jewelers in Annapolis. "We don't know what's going to happen today and tomorrow. We're just holding on day by day."If Cezanne Jewelers closes, four full-time jobs would disappear.Maryland has 175,000 small businesses that make up 83% of the state's economy, according to the comptroller. "So once this virus is past us, we actually have an economy. Otherwise, we risk 25% unemployment. We are, unfortunately, predicting huge decreases in tax revenue and, most of all, my concern is the small businesses will never reopen after they close," Franchot said.It's known that layoffs have occurred; however the extent of jobless claims is unknown because numbers will not be available for this week. Federal officials asked its state counterparts to reveal nothing until next week.Baltimore mayor orders freeze on hiring, spending amid coronavirus pandemicBaltimore Mayor Jack Young released a statement Friday, saying he has instructed the Finance Department to immediately freeze all non-essential hiring and spending. On the hiring side, sworn public safety positions will be exempted. Those positions include police officers, paramedics, firefighters and EMTs, and sheriff's deputies. Agencies can request an exemption for other positions."From a budgeting standpoint, municipalities across the state, and throughout the nation, will need to be fiscally prudent as we navigate this unprecedented emergency," Young said in a statement. "The hiring and spending freeze represents a pair of necessary first steps to ensure that as revenues continue to decline, we remain in a position to quickly respond to the needs of our residents and first responders."According to the statement, the city's Finance Department, based on assumptions related to the pandemic, is forecasting sharp declines in a variety of city revenue sources, including the hotel tax, admissions tax, convention center receipts, parking-related revenues, traffic-camera revenues, income tax and others.​PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/REVjIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

This is a public health crisis like nothing we have ever faced before—we are all in this together, and we will get through this together,” Hogan said. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski released a statement on the latest death: "My prayers are with all those who lost a loved one tonight. This sad passing is a stark reminder of the seriousness of the crisis we face, and it breaks my heart to know that this will not be the last life we lose to this pandemic. That is why, even as we grieve, we also each need to do our part to reduce the spread and flatten the curve. Stay home. Practice social distancing. Those failing to do their part only add to the toll this crisis will take. We can save lives, but only if we take this seriously and continue to work together."As of Saturday morning, there were 190 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state.PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/Tk5SIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

It's not every day you see a car being lifted into the air by a crane, but that's exactly what happened Tuesday at MedStar Good Samaritan Hospital.A 2007 Lincoln MKZ headed straight for the fifth floor to the inpatient rehabilitation center to assist people like Curtis Taylor."At first, when I came here, I really couldn't even stand up or walk, and then they have helped me to walk and I'm almost able to run," Taylor said.Curtis has been in the hospital for two weeks after getting cellulitis in his right leg. Thanks to hard work and help from his therapists, he's heading home."It's just good to have that assistance of the therapist to be able to get back on the right track," he said.The car is key to getting patients like Curtis back on track. Many of them are suffering with loss of mobility due to Parkinson's, stroke, amputation or other conditions.The center has a mock grocery store, ramps, steps and now, a car -- things the patients need to practice on so they feel confident when it's time to go home. "Family members really get nervous about, 'How am I going to get my family member into the car?' So, we can do family training right there with the patient, practicing getting in and out of the car, teaching them skills, where to put their hands, how to help the patient, how to adjust the seat. So, it's really good, real-time doing this with the families and patients," said Francine Clayton, occupational therapy program coordinator at MedStar.MedStar said the goal is for patients to not only go home with the physical skills, but also confidence."It's a good feeling to be able to be independent again," Curtis said.​             BALTIMORE

Rehabilitation work on Bay Bridge to be complete by summer
.W
Redecking work on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge will wrap up a year ahead of schedule, the governor announces.

Redecking work on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge will wrap up a year ahead of schedule, the governor announced Tuesday.Gov. Larry Hogan, along with officials from the Maryland Transportation Authority, said all lanes of the Bay Bridge will be back open by some time this summer, making way for cashless tolls this summer, which will mean fewer delays as the project gets closer to completion.The deck rehabilitation project began in September 2019 after more than a decade of deferred maintenance resulted in severe deterioration of the westbound right lane surface, posing a number of safety risks.Hogan explained why the repairs are so important, saying, "For more than a decade, critical maintenance and necessary repairs at the bridge were repeatedly delayed, and this delay caused some tremendous safety problems which needed to be addressed, and the deck surface of the westbound lane was severely deteriorated well beyond its service life."In October 2019, people on both sides of the bridge reached their boiling points because of traffic, so Hogan directed the MDTA to expedite the Bay Bridge redecking project and get cashless tolls in ASAP.The governor also said Tuesday that cashless tolling at the Bay Bridge will be fully operational by this summer as well, allowing for wider lanes and more free-flowing traffic on the bridge.MDTA work crews removed toll booth No. 4 from the Bay Bridge toll plaza, marking the first milestone toward a cashless toll system. Hogan said the electronic tolling will provide much-needed relief from recent traffic jams."The idea that those delays could continue for two years made it even more unacceptable to nearly everyone," Hogan said.Crews worked through the Thanksgiving holiday to get ahead of schedule. Currently, all of the milling work is complete and concrete pouring is halfway finished, leaving work on joints and punctures to be repaired."It allowed us to work through those four or five weeks to expedite this project. It also allowed us to work on all four zones at the same time," said James Ports Jr., executive director of the MDTA.Residents who live near and use the Bay Bridge, like Todd Garth, are optimistic the expedited schedule and cashless tolls will make just driving to the grocery store easier."Right now, between May and September, we actually don’t leave the house after 2 o’clock in the afternoon on Fridays," Garth said. "Off-season, it has helped, so if that also helps during beach season, that’ll be great. It does seem to of made a difference.""It has been a difficult process for the folks that are trying to get across the bridge and the traffic has been difficult, but getting it done a year early, I think in the long run, it's going to make people a lot happier," Hogan said.Take a closer look at the stages of construction here.

Two tigers rescued last month from cramped cages in a truck stuck on the Poland-Belarus border got their first taste of freedom this week as they explored an outdoor enclosure in their new home at a zoo.

Two tigers rescued last month from cramped cages in a truck stuck on the Poland-Belarus border got their first taste of freedom this week as they explored an outdoor enclosure in their new home at a zoo.Maximus and Fenix, who were among nine tigers being transported from Italy to Russia, have now found shelter at the private Zoo Canpol in Poland. The zoo owner said she can hardly recognize the two male tigers from when they first arrived several weeks ago.Although both Maximus and Fenix were initially hesitant in their new haven, they soon relaxed and began exploring the enclosure.The zoo owner said the tigers had previously been kept in a smaller enclosure meant to help them overcome their feelings of fear and increase their trust in humans.The other seven tigers are currently in quarantine at another zoo in Poland.The tigers spent days stuck in cages on a truck at the border, having started in Rome and traveling some 1,200 miles.

Business owners said it's going to be tough to shut down.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Gov. Larry Hogan, in announcing an even more aggressive attempt to quash the coronavirus pandemic, ordered all nonessential businesses to shut down by 5 p.m. Monday.At Foundry Row in Owings Mills, salons were shutting down and a massage parlor already closed a while ago."This morning, I have enacted an executive order which closes all nonessential businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities in Maryland effective at 5 o'clock today," Hogan said Monday morning.For Myrtle Kee, the announcement was expected. She just opened her salon, Personal Glamour, in January."Being self-employed, there's not a lot I can do, I just have to pray and ask God to keep me. If you are in the situation where you don't have savings, you pretty much are in trouble at a time like this," Kee said.Sheryl Stanford, a hairdresser, knew the shutdown was coming, too, and she said it will be very difficult."(It's) pretty devastating. I love what I do, it's my passion, and I know there's going to be a lot of upset people. My kids will love it, but I love work," Stanford said.With no professional sporting events, Jeffrey Katzen, who owns Baltimore Sports and Novelty, knew he was going to take a hit."I'm nonessential. I am essential if the Ravens are playing at home. It's more important for people to be safe and stay home. They can always order online, or on Facebook, we can ship it to them," Katzen said.PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/TkJoIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19-tracking map has leveled up to show more granular data on the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases around the globe.Since January, well before the coronavirus began rapidly infecting people in the United States, a team from Johns Hopkins University had been tracking the virus' spread in China and other countries worldwide.Now, a little over two months since launching the interactive map, the tool now shows data reflecting real-time confirmed cases in cities and localities across the U.S. and internationally.The university announced Monday morning that its tracking map's dashboard now displays "the numbers of confirmed cases and fatalities for each local jurisdiction in an effort to best inform the public and to aid health care and emergency workers responding to the crisis," according to an advisory.Read the full story from our partners at the Baltimore Business Journal             BALTIMORE

Baltimore-area leaders are sending a message that they are prepared to address concerns connected to the coronavirus pandemic.

Baltimore-area leaders are sending a message that they are prepared to address concerns connected to the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, joined by major department heads Monday afternoon, addressed questions, concerns and rumors making the rounds.The mayor said he supports Gov. Larry Hogan's order issued Monday to close nonessential businesses."This order helps protect our most vulnerable residents by limiting opportunities for the disease to spread," Young said.The governor's announcement did not include a shelter-in-place requirement, but city officials are urging residents to remain home as much as possible to help limit contact and slow the transmission of the coronavirus.In the city, a police Social Distancing Task Force is responsible for enforcing governor's directive, and officers will check to make sure businesses are closed and will keep an eye on them."Just like with the first executive order, we are now making adjustments to make sure we can enforce the governor's executive orders with the additional closures beginning at 5 p.m. (Monday), and when we get calls of noncompliance where there are gatherings of 10 people or more, we are responding to that and dispersing those individuals and educating those business owners as to what's required with the governor's executive orders. We've had a few calls to disperse gatherings of 10 or more, and we will continue to do that, and we will continue patrols and answering calls to make sure that our Social Distancing Task force will go out and make sure that businesses are in compliance, and when we find that they are not, we will take appropriate action," Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said."Our approach is to make sure that people recognize the fact that this is a serious matter and that this is the order of the governor. To this point, we've had full compliance, we haven't had any issues, and we've been successful, but at the end of the day, we will make sure that when we have gatherings that get brought to our attention, they will be resolved," Baltimore County Police Chief Melissa Hyatt said.The order will not impact essential city services -- police, fire and emergency responders will continue to respond to 911 calls; trash and recycling will still be picked up; and Citizen Drop-Off Centers will remain open, among other services. Additionally, the Emergency Operations Center will remain active to manage the city's response to the virus.Speaking Monday afternoon, Harrison also clarified the purpose of the National Guard in Baltimore."I want to take this time to play down any rumors that might be out there: The National Guard is here to support meal distribution, provide aid and planning and transportation and logistical assistance as needed, but the Baltimore Police Department is committed to working around the clock to keep the members of the public and the department informed of where the agency stands with COVID-19 preparations and actions," Harrison said.As of Monday morning, Baltimore City has 31 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Maryland Department of Health.There is evidence of community transmission of the coronavirus in Baltimore.Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said the city's response is focused on community mitigation and preparation for potential hospital surge, adding that not everyone requires testing or evaluation by a physician for the onset of mild symptoms."The Maryland Department of Health updated some of its policies in order to ensure that those at high risk for COVID-19 will be prioritized for testing,” Dzirasa said.“We really only want people to call 911 when there is a life-threatening emergency we don't want to over exacerbate the system,” said BCFD Fire Chief Niles Ford.The Baltimore City fire chief said nine city fire personnel in two incidents were taken off-duty temporarily after handling two suspected coronavirus patients. Those patients turned out to be negative for coronavirus, and the personnel returned to duty.Several city agencies have adjusted service hours and operations.Parking Authority of Baltimore -- The Parking Authority of Baltimore remains closed. However, staff are available to assist the public via email at parkingauthority@bcparking.com  or by phone at 443-573-2800. No employees will be working from the office until the emergency has been lifted.Parking meters/parking meter restrictions will not be in effect for this period.No payment is required at parking meters.Baltimore Municipal and Zoning Appeals (BMZA) -- As of Monday, BMZA has suspended all operations. No new appeals will be accepted and all hearings in April are hereby suspended until further notice. New appeals and rescheduled hearings will be scheduled and heard on an expedited basis when operations resume.Mayor's Office of Employment Development -- MOED has suspended the operation of its adult and youth service locations due to COVID-19. This impacts a number of the services. Those seeking help with finding employment or other supports are encouraged to visit the MOED's website for links to resources that are available at this time.Department of Transportation -- The Department of Transportation (DOT) will scale back its employee workforce in order to comply with social distancing protocols.  On-call crews will be used to perform daily agency operations, which will be significantly reduced.  As a result, the following services will be affected:The enforcement of Residential Permit Parking, street cleaning parking, 48-hour parking, abandoned vehicles and peak hour parking violations will be suspended. Transportation Enforcement Officers will focus on citing immediate safety and pedestrian issues.Vehicle towing operations will be significantly reduced and will focus on immediate safety issues. The city's impound facilities at Pulaski Highway and Fallsway remain closed to the public.DOT Maintenance crews and operations will be scaled back to focus on emergency and critical issues related to the repair of roadways, signs, lighting, etc.Traffic calming studies will be postponed.Federal contract work will continue to operate throughout the city of Baltimore. This includes bridge, buildings and reconstruction/streetscape projects.Paving and sidewalk work (except for federally funded projects) will be postponed.Conduit contractors will reduce their work forces and respond only to critical BGE-related repairs.DOT's Right-of-Way office remains closed to the public and permit requests should be submitted online.Parking meter payments/restrictions will not be enforced for this period.Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Maryland Olympic hopeful torn over postponement of games amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Life has taken another unsettling turn for a Marylander Olympic hopeful.

Life has taken another unsettling turn for a Marylander Olympic hopeful.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||The postponement of the Tokyo Games is a huge disappointment for Reisterstown-native Olivia Gruver, who's enduring the emotional struggle of uncertainty 3,000 miles from home.Getting used to disappointment is already an Olympic athlete skill. There are so many ups and downs on the journey to try and be among the best in the world.For Gruver, a former Franklin High School star, the coronavirus has landed hard on her pole-vaulting dreams. The NCAA Indoor Championships were canceled the day they were set to begin. And Gruver, a two-time champion from the University of Washington, had eyes on setting the all-time NCAA mark.Instead, she settles for being named the NCAA Female Athlete of the Year."It stings still that I didn't get to compete, but being recognized as being one of the best in college makes it a little sweeter," Gruver said.Gruver's father, Andrew Gruver, felt the sting of disappointment, too."Would she have liked to have gotten her third NCAA National Championship? Absolutely. Her goal was to break the NCAA indoor record. She has the outdoor, but she wanted that indoor, and she was really close to getting it," Andrew Gruver said.And, as she awaited the news for the fate of the 2020 Olympic Games, strong opinions had been formed."The Olympics has always been the goal. Jumping high and going to the Olympics, that has been the main goal," Olivia Gruver said. "I want to stay in, and I want to social distance, and I want to do all of that to help and get the virus out of effecting people. But in the back of your head, the Olympics has always been my dream, so I have to do everything I can to go there, but the world is being affected right now. So, emotionally, I'm torn on what to do."Regardless, a one-year postponement likely will not end her Olympic dreams. Meanwhile, living 3,000 miles from family, in the middle of the pandemic, that's the hard part."I send my love to them, always, but it's just always been hard. But they know this is where I need to be to achieve my dreams, and I've always appreciated them for that," Olivia Gruver said.WBAL-TV 11 News interviewed Olivia Gruver before the news came out that the Olympics would be postponed. After the news broke, in a text message, Olivia Gruver said, "It hurts a bit, but it's the right thing to do." Now, she can eat some ice cream.             REISTERSTOWN, Md.

Maryland governor orders nonessential businesses to close amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued an order Monday for nonessential businesses to close Monday evening amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued an order Monday for nonessential businesses to close Monday evening in a more aggressive attempt to quash the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||"This is an exceptionally challenging time for Marylanders and all Americans," Hogan said. "We can't wait for or rely on the federal government to act."Hogan issued an executive order closing all nonessential businesses, organizations and establishments in Maryland effective 5 p.m. Monday, which is in addition to businesses already closed by previous executive orders.The new executive order closes all those businesses that are not covered by the federal guidelines defining "critical infrastructure sectors," which include, health care, food and agriculture, energy, public works, community-based government operations, the chemical, hazardous materials, and defense industrial base sectors, law enforcement and public safety, transportation, critical manufacturing, financial services, and water and wastewater.|| List of what is considered essential business |||| Update: Additional businesses, organizations, facilities that may remain open || Business owners said shutting down will be tough.The governor's actions stop short of ordering people to stay home, an action other states have taken, including Delaware and Pennsylvania."We are not ordering a shelter-in-place directive or forcing people to stay home; however, we are telling all Marylanders to follow all the directives we have issued and follow state law of holding crowds to 10 people," Hogan said.Hogan spoke to a number of people who were not practicing social distancing."I just want to take a moment to thank the majority of Marylanders who have taken this seriously. Unfortunately, many people are not taking this seriously," Hogan said. "If you are engaged in this type of activity, you are breaking the law and you are literally endangering the lives of your family friends and fellow citizens."Hogan said additional enforcement efforts will be taken to disperse gatherings."Beginning today, even further and more aggressive enforcement actions will be taken by state and local authorities to disperse these gatherings," Hogan said. "Unless you have a critical reason to leave, you should stay home."Hogan's order comes after the state already took sweeping measures to close schools, malls and entertainment venues, among other locations. He's also establishing an alternate care site at the Baltimore Convention Center and Hilton Hotel.The governor announced Maryland has seen a 678% spike in positive coronavirus cases since last week. The Maryland Department of Health announced Monday that the state has 288 confirmed cases of coronavirus, much of it centered in the D.C. suburbs."Our first priority is saving the lives of thousands of Marylanders," Hogan said. "It's going to take all of us working together to save thousands of lives."Watch: Gov. Hogan announces new directivesTESTING: The governor enacted an emergency order to authorize a fast-track process to bring more testing capacity online without U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to shorten a process that would ordinarily take several months.The Maryland Department of Health is issuing an order to require health-care providers to prioritize tests for hospitalized and chronic-care patients, symptomatic first responders and symptomatic nursing home patients.The governor said four Motor Vehicle Administration sites are ready for drive-through testing as soon as the state gets the test kits and the personal protective equipment necessary to do it.Also, $5 million is being used to incentivize local production of crucial supplies, including, facemasks, ventilators and personal protective equipment.BUSINESS: With so many businesses now closed and so many workers not collecting paychecks, the Hogan administration is rolling out a $175 million move to ensure the state's economy survives the coronavirus pandemic.Small and medium-sized businesses make up 83% of the Maryland economy."We're also facing another huge battle against the potential of tremendous economic harm," Hogan said. "We will have your backs in the weeks ahead, and we will do everything we can to help get you back on your feet and to help all of your employees recover."|| LINK: Maryland Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Business ||The economic arsenal announced Monday includes $75 million for the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Loan Fund, $50 million for the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Grant Fund and $7 million for the COVID-19 Layoff Aversion Fund.Businesses and nonprofits with under 50 full- and part-time employees will be eligible, and loans will range up to $50,000 and grants up to $10,000, according to the governor's office.The governor has allocated $5 million and the Maryland Department of Labor has allocated $2 million to collaboratively launch the COVID-19 Layoff Aversion Fund.A total of $7 million in funds will be available to provide flexible rapid response services to proactively support businesses and workers undergoing economic stresses due to COVID-19."Our businesses must survive and our people must have jobs they can return to when things return to normal," Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz said. "We are in uncharted waters now. The situation is unlike anything we've seen in our lifetimes, but we will get through this."PRICE GOUGING: Hogan has signed an emergency order to protect families from price gouging on everyday household items and essentials. Retailers who attempt to exploit this crisis will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, Hogan said.NATIONAL GUARD: Hogan has directed the Maryland National Guard and the Maryland Department of Health to collaborate with Prince George's County and the University of Maryland Medical System on a pilot assessment location at FedEx Field in Landover.On Friday, Hogan activated the Maryland National Guard to help hospitals in setting up triage tents, conducting temperature screenings at state buildings, transporting patients and supporting the state Emergency Operations Center.The mission of Guard members is to provide assistance amid the outbreak. National Guard officials want to make sure the public knows its members are not in place to enforce the law, but instead to support medical efforts to slow down the spread of the virus.Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski requested on Monday support from the Maryland National Guard in Baltimore County to provide humanitarian and emergency management assistance."We've asked for the Guard's help to support our county's evolving response to this unprecedented pandemic," Olszewski said in a statement. "These are neighbors from our communities who are here to support us all during this uncertain time. We'll continue to work hand-in-hand with our partners across the state to provide assistance to our communities, reduce the spread of the virus, and save lives."Olszewski's statement said the Maryland National Guard would support food distribution operations at school and recreational sites throughout Baltimore County and provide additional planning and logistical support to enhance the county's emergency response. National Guard forces would be staged at the Timonium Fairgrounds and then be deployed to locations across the county as needed.HOSPITAL SURGE PLAN: The governor has ordered the establishment of an alternate care site at Baltimore Convention Center and Hilton Hotel as part of a joint partnership in collaboration with UMMS and Johns Hopkins. The governor has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deliver 250 beds and 50 bed packages to support the initiative. UMMS has agreed to reopen Laurel Hospital, which will make another 135 beds available.PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/YmVIIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Comptroller's task force on e-smoking devices recommends changes
.W
Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot's task force on electronic smoking devices, like vaping, issued its final report on potential changes.

Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot's task force on electronic smoking devices, like vaping, issued its final report on potential changes.The group's report recommends 12 policy and regulatory changes to safeguard overall public health and protect children from lifelong addiction to nicotine.Some of the recommendations include banning all direct-to-consumer internet and mail-order sales of electronic smoking devices, restricting sales of flavored vaping pods and prohibiting anyone under 21 from entering vape shops.The task force also recommended passing new legislation to bring Maryland in compliance with the new federally mandated minimum of age of 21 to buy tobacco and electronic devices.FROM THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE:The comptroller's e-facts task force made the following recommendations to safeguard overall public health and protect young people from lifelong addiction to nicotine:1. Ban all direct-to-consumer internet and mail-order sales of ESDs."The General Assembly should pass legislation to prohibit all sales of ESDs that do not occur face-to-face. Today, many children receive their first ESD in a package delivered to their mailbox without their parents' knowledge or any attempt at age verification by internet-based sellers. This needs to stop, and the Comptroller's Field Enforcement Division is committing to working with the Maryland Attorney General's Office and the federal government to enforce a total ban on internet, mail order and direct-to-consumer sales of ESDs into Maryland."2. Restrict sales of flavored e-liquids and refillable "tank" systems exclusively to "vape shop vendors," prohibit entry to these retailers by anyone under the age of 21 and prohibit these retailers from selling all other tobacco/nicotine products."The General Assembly should pass legislation to prohibit sales of flavored e-liquids and refillable 'tank' systems by grocery stores, convenience stores and gas stations, and restrict sales of those products exclusively by those businesses licensed as 'Vape Shop Vendors' (VSVs). As part of this legislation, VSVs should be made to register with the local health department (in addition to getting their state license), prohibit the entry of anyone under age 21 into a vape shop at any time and prohibit vape shops from selling any other tobacco products."3. Require ESD manufacturers to provide component and ingredient listings to the state of Maryland before products can be sold and require laboratory testing to verify these claims before products can be sold at retail."In order to pinpoint the cause of an outbreak of illnesses like EVALI, the state of Maryland should know precisely what e-liquids and ESD devices contain before these products ever reach consumers. The General Assembly should establish authority for the Field Enforcement Division's Laboratory in Jessup to conduct testing of ingredients, ESD component parts, and vapor contents prior to marketing of any device or e-liquid in Maryland."4. Require separate manufacturing, wholesale and retail licenses for each category of product (cig/other tobacco product/ESD) and increase licensure fees for each category."Legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2017 created a licensing ambiguity that allows any cigarette or 'other tobacco product' wholesaler/distributor/retailer to sell ESDs without acquiring a separate license to do so. The Maryland General Assembly should correct this ambiguity, and require every wholesaler, manufacturer, distributor or retailer of ESDs to acquire a separate and specific license to do so -- and enforce parity across the spectrum of fees for each of these license types, so that the cost to become an ESD manufacturer or OTP manufacturer or cigarette manufacturer is the same."5. Pass corrective legislation to bring Maryland in compliance with the new federally mandated minimum age of 21 to purchase tobacco and ESDs -- without exceptions."The General Assembly should bring Maryland law into compliance with the new federal standard age for tobacco/ESD sales. Maryland law currently exempts 'active duty member(s) of the military; (who) present valid military identification' from 2019 legislation that increased the minimum age to purchase tobacco and ESD products to 21. As noted, the federal government recently changed the law -- effective nationwide -- to 21 without exceptions."6. Amend the Maryland Clean Indoor Air Quality Act to include emissions from ESDs."The General Assembly should amend the text of the Maryland Clean Indoor Air Quality Act to include emissions from ESDs in order to protect children and adults from secondhand exposure to nicotine and other constituent elements of ESDs."7. Increased criminal/civil penalties for "straw buyers" purchasing on behalf of, or transferring tobacco or ESDs to, individuals under the age of 21."The General Assembly should amend the statute relating to illegal purchases or transfers on behalf of individuals under 21 be expanded to include ESDs and any other product containing nicotine. As it stands, Criminal Law § 10-107 only refers exclusively to sale of 'a tobacco product' without specific mention of ESDs or other products containing nicotine. Because so-called 'straw purchases' constitute a primary means (approximately 20%) for young people to access ESDs, the penalties for this practice should include the potential for incarceration and increased fines."8. Require retailers to purchase and use ID-scanning technology for each sale -- without the possibility of a machine "override" -- and require an id scan to "unlock" purchase of tobacco/ESDs and other age-restricted products."The Comptroller's Office will promulgate a regulation to require retailers of tobacco and ESD products to acquire point-of-sale systems that incorporate a fully 'locked down' process for all tobacco/ESD product codes wherein the scanning of government-issued identification proving legal age is required to complete a sale. This regulation will remove 'human error' out of the equation for retailers and prevent unlawful point-of-sale purchases by individuals under the age of 21."9. Require education for retailers upon renewal or issuance of license by comptroller."The Comptroller's Office will promulgate a regulation to require retailers of tobacco and ESD products to complete (prior to the forthcoming license year, 2021) an educational program created by the Department of Health advising them on the dangers of tobacco/ESD use to all consumers -- generally -- and, specifically, how tobacco/ESDs are harmful to underage users."10. Establish disciplinary protocol for retailers who sell ESDs, e-liquids or tobacco products to individuals under 21 -- including suspension/revocation of their license."The Comptroller's Office will promulgate regulations to codify progressive discipline for retailers that are cited by local health departments for violations of local/state laws relating to tobacco and ESDs, establish clear policies and procedures for submission of referrals with standard criteria, create predictable consequences for violators and communicate enforcement outcomes immediately to local Tobacco Coordinators."11. Publish quarterly list of tobacco/ESD violators on the comptroller's website."The Comptroller's Office will utilize its website and social media platforms to publicize 'bad actors' in Maryland who sell to minors, offer unauthorized products for sale, or otherwise violate local, state or federal laws."12. Establish a statewide, consistent, nondisciplinary policy for tobacco/ESD prevention and diversion with updated and age-relevant information to be used by educators and administrators."The Maryland State Department of Education and the Department of Health should produce a statewide policy that directs the actions that educators and administrators should take when confronted by a student found using or possessing tobacco/ESDs. From both inside and outside the Task Force, reports describe a disjointed, misdirected, and excessively-punitive process for young people caught with tobacco/ESDs. MSDE and MDH should work collaboratively on a policy that treats tobacco/ESD use as a symptom of nicotine addiction, rather than a disciplinary challenge."             BALTIMORE

The building was cleared of all remaining personnel and has been vacant since March 20, officials said. Officials said all employees who may have been in contact with the second individual have been on self-quarantine since March 18. None have shown symptoms at this time, officials said.

Maryland seafood industry affected by coronavirus outbreak

Maryland's seafood industry could be in real trouble because of the coronavirus.

Maryland's seafood industry could be in real trouble because of the coronavirus.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||As restaurants move to carryout only, demand for seafood has plummeted and the crab season is just around the corner.WBAL-TV 11 News spoke with watermen on Kent Island and has their reaction. There are a limited number of coronavirus cases on the Eastern Shore. But the virus does seem to be having an impact on catching oysters, fishing and crabbing. Watermen told 11 News that because of the virus, the whole seafood industry may collapse.“If we were in full production right now, compared to what we were two weeks ago, this room would be completely full of people all day eight to 10 hours a day,” said Jason Ruth, owner of Harris’ Seafood Company.Ruth said usually during oyster season, he's processing hundreds of bushels a day; now he's processing virtually nothing.After restaurants were forced to close their dining rooms, demand for seafood dropped dramatically.“Right now, the climate in the seafood business is absolutely horrific ever since the announcements that eat-in restaurants were shut down. We really took it on the chin. It virtually shut down the last two weeks that were left in the oyster season,” said Ruth.Out on the water, those who catch the oysters are feeling the pain, as well, on what was set to be one of the better oyster seasons on record.“It kind of put us out of business and now we're looking at spring fishing and going into summer fishing, and the markets are slowed almost to a standstill for that and now we're worried about the crabs,” said Jim Reihl, Maryland Oysterman's Association president."Worried about crabs," is not a good thing for Marylanders to hear. With social distancing, crab feasts would be out as well.“It's not good. Virtually we’re shut down,” said Chuckie White, Kent County Watermen’s Association president.Crabbers like White aren't sure if they're going to start setting traps on April 1; if there is little to no demand, there would be no way to make up the costs.“You've got money out and gear equipment and your boats and you're hoping to get it back, but there's no guarantee we're going to do that this year,” said White.The watermen 11 News spoke with said they're hoping for some sort of relief from the state or federal government, for without it, there could be rough seas ahead on Kent Island.Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Larry Hogan's team will be transforming the Baltimore Convention Center and the neighboring Hilton hotel into field hospitals.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||The field hospitals are part of the governor's hospital-surge plan he announced Monday morning. He said there are currently 900 beds available, and he expects 1,400 more to come in the next month."Plans are underway as we speak to establish a field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center as and an alternate care site and at the adjacent Hilton Hotel in Baltimore City," Hogan said.The Maryland National Guard is turning the buildings into temporary medical facilities."These will be operated through a joint partnership with the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins," Hogan said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency will deliver 250 hospital beds and 50 bed packages to support the initiative.The shortage of hospital beds is a concern. The Greater Baltimore Medical Center told 11 News that its emergency department volume is lower than usual during this time of year. So far, GBMC is treating four coronavirus patients -- one remains in the hospital and the others are at home. GBMC has conducted 296 tests, 58 returned negative and 174 tests are pending."The truth is none of us really know how bad it is going to get or how long it's going to last," Hogan said.Live Baltimore issued a statement saying, in part: "It's inspiring to see our city and state working together like this."Peggy Daidakis, executive director of the Baltimore Convention Center sent a statement to 11 News, saying: "The center has been designated as an 'alternative care' facility by Gov. Hogan. When conditions necessitate and additional hospital beds are needed, the Baltimore Convention Center will host these alternative care units under the direction of the University of Maryland Medical Services and Johns Hopkins in partnership with state and local government including Mayor (Jack) Young's team. To be prepared for all scenarios, the center will be receiving freight in the coming days to support alternative care operations, but that does not mean those services are imminent. From this moment and until further notice, the facility is closed to the general public. We stand ready, when needed, to in this effort. We commend Gov. Hogan and his team for taking swift and decisive action to slow the spread of COVID-19."PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/U2paIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Governor tours coronavirus field hospital being set up at Baltimore Convention Center

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is touring the Baltimore Convention Center, where the National Guard is setting up a field hospital as part of the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan toured the Baltimore Convention Center, where the National Guard is setting up a field hospital as part of the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||On the ground floor of the Baltimore Convention Center, health officials briefed the governor Tuesday morning on the plan to turn the space into a temporary hospital."This is much better than a tent hospital," Hogan said. "My hope would be it is not filled with sick and dying patients, but I am hoping it will be an operational hospital and will help the people who need help."Speaking to those responsible for the setup, Hogan said, "This is going to be a part of the surge capacity that we will need.   You're all doing incredible work.  I'm anxious to see it get done.  It is going to save lives.  It's pretty amazing."The field hospital at the convention center, and the neighboring Hilton hotel, are part of the governor's hospital-surge plan he announced Monday morning. There will be 250 beds made available to serve patients who are sick but not in need of critical care.The Maryland National Guard is turning the buildings into temporary medical facilities. The facilities will be operated through a joint partnership with the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins."This plan to sort of relieve the pressure within hospitals of patients that don't need ventilation, ICU care are all part of the process to get us ready for the surge," Johns Hopkins surgeon Dr. Jonathan Efron said.But if there is to be a surge, when might it start?The state's coronavirus confirmed cases stood at 349 as of Tuesday morning, which is 17% higher than yesterday."They are doing all kinds of modelling and projections, but the honest answer is nobody has an exact answer to that question. A lot of it depends on the surge and how successful we are with dampening down this rush," Hogan said.Hogan said he has pressed Congress to pass a stimulus package. Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pressed for aid directly to cities."We are calling on the president to give stimulus packages to the city and the state. They are bailing out the corporations, but who is bailing out the cities that (are) going to have the big tab of revenue loss," Young said.Hogan, who is chairman of the National Governors Association, pushed back against the president's repeated rosy prediction that restrictions can be loosened as soon as the end of the month."That is an optimistic view. I would love to see that happen, but I think most of the experts in the federal government say that's not the case," Hogan said.Coronavirus remains a health crisis with few clear answers. Efron said there's no way to know how many people may be sick with the virus, based on the limited testing."I think it is impossible to tell. I think it is really impossible to know for sure," Efron said.After touring the convention center, the governor went to the Greenmount Recreation Center, where officials are distributing food to those who need it."I just want to talk about how important it is being able to provide these meals to all the folks that need them. The city's doing a wonderful job. We've got these food centers up all across the state, and I want to thank the Guard for helping out, too," Hogan said. "In spite of this crisis, it's even more important to get meals, but we want to make sure everybody's safe and they still maintain social distancing."The governor told 11 News that the biggest gap in response to the coronavirus is the lack of adequate medical supplies, such as ventilators and protective gear.Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

How to prevent spread of coronavirus while handling mail, packages

While Gov. Larry Hogan stopped short of enacting a shelter-in-place order, the new restriction closing all nonessential businesses is an effort to have Marylanders stay at home and practice social distancing.

While Gov. Larry Hogan stopped short of enacting a shelter-in-place order, the new restriction closing all nonessential businesses is an effort to have Marylanders stay at home and practice social distancing.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Under the latest order, places like retail stores, hair salons and nail salons will have to close, while liquor stores, pharmacies, grocery stores, big box stores and other businesses are exempt.At this time, restaurants and bars will remain open for takeout and delivery.More and more people are ordering online deliveries to avoid going out to stores, but could those boxes unintentionally deliver the coronavirus right to doorsteps?Packages and mail are handled by a lot of different people, many of whom you'll never even see. So during the pandemic, you want to take extra precautions to make sure you're keeping yourself and your family safe.“I think that we shouldn't be extremely concerned, but I do think it makes sense to use caution,” said Dr. Miriam Alexander, with LifeBridge Health.Using caution means paying attention to everything coming into your home during the coronavirus pandemic. Many people are having more things delivered instead of going out to the store to avoid the virus, but when asked if it's possible that the virus lives on the outside packages: "We're not exactly sure how long. It's different for paper, for styrofoam and cardboard, for metal, for wood,” said Alexander.Alexander said the risk is low. Most transmissions will happen person to person from respiratory droplets, but it doesn't hurt to be extra careful.“You can open them outside of the house and actually throw the waste right in the recycling, and then bring the mail or the interior things of the packaging inside and I would probably then -- after you open the mail, open the packaging -- I would wash your hands very well with soap and water,” said Alexander.Also don't forget to disinfect any surface the outer boxes touched, like a countertop. You can also take the same precautions with takeout or delivery food.Alexander said if nothing else, it's an opportunity to get back into good habits.“It should be a reminder to all of us that we should always be washing our hands frequently with good soap and water or using antibacterial products, and we should be cleaning the counters of our kitchen all the time,” said Alexander.

Baltimore pharmacy makes changes amid coronavirus outbreak

At a pharmacy in northeast Baltimore, concerns about coronavirus have led to a different type of welcome. The front door is locked, employees wearing masks and gloves greet you at the back entrance.

At Northern Pharmacy in northeast Baltimore, concerns about coronavirus have led to a different type of welcome. The front door is locked, employees wearing masks and gloves greet customers at the back entrance.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||For now, no customers are allowed inside.“Crazy times. Do the best you can and make adjustments you have to make,” said customer Dominic Purviance.They are asked to practice social distance and workers are to remain at least six feet apart from each other.“I've got 158 employees in different buildings and I have to make sure the community is kept healthy and safe,” said Pepper K. Mintz, the president and CEO.Mintz said everyone is stressed, including those who rely on the medication hydroxychloroquine.“It's impossible to get now. We have some here,” said Mintz.But the supply is minimal, it seems the price has doubled. People are hoarding the pills and pharmacies are running out after President Donald Trump recently talked about medicine and an antibiotic being possible game changers in the fight against the coronavirus.Paralegal Debbie Kent worries these developments may have a devastating impact on her and others who rely on hydroxychloroquine.“If I'm unable to get this medication it very well may cost me my life. It's what keeps me alive. I have an autoimmune disorder where my system attacks itself,” said Kent.The medicine is considered crucial in treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and is a possible treatment for coronavirus.“When they decided to glom on to the supply, they are not considering the people who have been taking the medication for years and years and need this to simply sustain their life,” said Kent.Kent said the same day Trump made his announcement, she went and got a refill of prescription, normally she would pay $111 --  at that time, she ended up paying $230,  for a 90-day supply.W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXe+7vw==             BALTIMORE

The Maryland National Guard is on a humanitarian mission all over Maryland to help distribute food to communities amid the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||It's a goodwill mission for the members of the Maryland National Guard. In addition to helping distribute food, Guard members are getting to know residents of communities, like in northeast Baltimore.A contingent of soldiers went to a recreation center in northeast Baltimore to help hand out food."What these rec centers are doing all over the city (is) they are handing out food to anybody who needs it, not just kids. At first, it was to help kids who usually get meals at school," Maryland National Guard Sgt. Robert Grimes said. "So we are just here to have interactions with the community. We want to let them know that we are here to help, to see us, not to be intimidated or anything like that."Residents are not only getting food for themselves, but for other family members. Many consider the meal of a sandwich, fruits and vegetables a blessing."It is extremely helpful because every time I go to the grocery store, there's no milk, and they give you milk here. So that makes up for what the grocery store doesn't have. They give me fruits and vegetables," said Mandie Palmer, of Baltimore."I'm loving this. We get to stay out, see people, greet people, let people know we have a friendly presence here," Maryland National Guard Sgt. Eric Scuderi said."You see the sincerity, you can tell that the people out here, not because they have to be, but they want to be, and that means a lot to me," said Justice Bey, of Baltimore."I was in a similar position, actually, growing up. So seeing stuff like that and being able to help people as part of the community is what we are here for," Maryland National Guard Sgt. Julian McFadden said.There were 210 meals prepared Tuesday. Guard officials believe the number will increase daily.Guard members said they are just trying to put a smile on everyone's face in this time of crisis.Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary.

Arnold Schwarzenegger makes $1 million donation to coronavirus relief
.W
Arnold Schwarzenegger donated $1 million to the Frontline Responders Fund and encouraged fans to donate, too, saying "we should all do our part" during the outbreak.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Arnold Schwarzenegger has emerged as an unlikely but welcome voice of reason. First he closed his sports expo to the public to prevent the spread of the virus, then posted a series of public service announcement-type videos in which he and his menagerie of farm animals urge people to stay home and practice social distancing to help flatten the curve. He even shared his equipment-free fitness plan, to encourage people to work out at home and avoid the gym.Now he's put his money where his mouth is. The actor and former governor of California has made a donation of $1 million to the Frontline Responders Fund, a crowdfunding page he co-founded to keep healthcare workers equipped with masks, gloves and other gear, and which at the time of his posting had raised more than $2.8 million."I never believed in sitting on the couch and complaining about how bad things are, I always believed we should all do our part to make things better," he wrote on Instagram. "This is a simple way to protect our real action heroes on the frontlines in our hospitals, and I’m proud to be part of it. I donated 1 million dollars, and I hope that all of you who can will step up to support these heroes."Schwarzenegger then encouraged his followers to make donations of their own by following the link.

How the coronavirus pandemic is affecting the homeless, and how they're being helped

Doctors, advocates and others are looking to make sure people experiencing homelessness get just as much help as other Americans.

Doctors, advocates and others are looking to make sure people experiencing homelessness get just as much help as other Americans. Communities across the U.S. and globe are seeking to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory disease. Vulnerable populations such as people experiencing homelessness could face even greater challenges than the typical household, given difficulties in accessing health care, separating from others and more."There are some communities that are putting shelters, tent shelters in place that I've heard about," said Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, a physician-scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.A national coalition of homeless advocacy groups is calling on Congress to set aside $5 billion to help people without housing.Maria Foscarinis, who leads the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, worries the pending $2 trillion stimulus bill, agreed to by Senate leaders, won't get checks into the hands of people who need it under the extreme circumstances.To address that, the center wants the checks to be delivered to shelters, soup kitchens food sites and pantries."They really desperately need this cash relief," Foscarinis said.More than 500,000 people live in the streets every day. Many of those are veterans, children or people with disabilities."I think this is something that every community is going to have to try to consider at a public health level and what to do to support people who don't have a place to go," Dionne-Odom said, "since this is probably not going to be a period of just a short time, but a prolonged time where we're dealing with coronavirus in our communities."

White House, Senate reach historic $2 trillion stimulus deal amid growing coronavirus fears
.W
The White House and Senate leaders have reached agreement on a $2 trillion measure to rush aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.

The White House and Senate leaders announced agreement Wednesday on an unparalleled, $2 trillion emergency bill to rush aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus outbreak.It's the largest economic rescue bill in history. The package is intended as a weeks-long or months-long patch for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide.Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget."A fight has arrived on our shores," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "We did not seek it, we did not want it, but now we're going to win it.""Big help, quick help, is on the way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.But not enough, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other. “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work."Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the package “goes a long way." He said it requires strong oversight to ensure the wealthy don't benefit at the expense of workers and proposed forgiving at least $10,000 of student loan debt as part of the federal response.McConnell and Schumer said passage of the legislation was expected in the Republican-led Senate by the end of the day. After a banner day on Tuesday as the package took shape, the stock market rallied even more on Wednesday.That would leave final congressional approval up to the Democratic-controlled House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bipartisan agreement “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people” but she stopped short of fully endorsing it.“House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action,” she said.House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber is unclear.House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for President Donald Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington. But that may prove challenging, as the bill is sure to be opposed by some conservatives upset at its cost and scope. Ardent liberals were restless as well.White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The wording of some final pieces of the agreement need to be completed.The sprawling, 500-page-plus measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid.It would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.McConnell, a key negotiator, said the package will “rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar."Five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins.“That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.”The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per childA huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at Schumer's insistence. Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency.Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.Schumer said businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance.The New York Democrat immediately sent out a roster of negotiating wins for transit systems, hospital, and cash-hungry state governments that were cemented after Democrats blocked the measure in votes held Sunday and Monday to maneuver for such gains.But Cuomo said the Senate package would send less than $4 billion to New York, far short of his estimate that the crisis will cost his state up to $15 billion over the next year. More than 280 New Yorkers have died from the virus, a death toll more than double that of any other state.Pelosi was a force behind $400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics said was political opportunism. The package also contains $15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps.Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 bank rescue, officials said.Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support.Germany alone, Europe's biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support — roughly 30 percent of that nation's entire annual output.France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs. The European Union has suspended limits it imposes on member countries' borrowing and deficits, freeing them to spend more.Some of Europe's fiscal stimulus kicks in automatically without any new legislation due to social welfare safety nets that are more extensive than in the U.S.At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in the coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month.Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.                                                                                                             Can blood from coronavirus survivors treat the newly ill?

A 29% spike in confirmed coronavirus cases in Baltimore City since Tuesday prompted new measures from the mayor's office.

A 29% spike in confirmed coronavirus cases in Baltimore City since Tuesday prompted new measures from the mayor's office.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Mayor Jack Young is doing what he can to help employees who are helping to slow the spread of coronavirus in Baltimore. Young announced a hazard pay, where there will be $200 extra every two weeks for police, firefighters and medics and $100 extra every two weeks for what the city calls "mission critical employees." With the city's number of confirmed coronavirus cases escalating, Young implored city residents to stay home."I need the residents of Baltimore City to do their part and stay home. I don't want them to panic, but I need them to understand the urgency of the situation we are in," Young said.As of Wednesday morning, Baltimore City has 53 confirmed coronavirus cases. Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said all cases in Baltimore are community-transmission cases. Sher said there are no hot spots, but highest-risk people are most vulnerable."We want to make sure we are protecting our high-risk population, so our congregant living, our first responders and our health care workers are on the top of that list," Dzirasa said.Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said officers have responded to complaints about too many people in one place, thus violating the order for fewer than 10 people to congregate."We've dispatched police, and will continue to dispatch police, to disperse crowds and educate (people) about social distancing. We had some of those calls already and have had to dispatch to places in private stores to dispatch groups of 10 or more," Harrison said.The police commissioner tamped down rumors about coronavirus among members of the Police Department, saying, as of Wednesday morning, the department has no confirmed cases.The Police Department has received a new supply of 5,000 masks from the Fire Department and a donation from Home Depot.With schools now staying closed longer, city officials must scramble to feed children, youth and older adults who can't get out."We know there is growing need as more time passes, as schools are closed, families are losing jobs, and our mass transit systems are reducing routes," said Tisha Edwards, who leads the Mayor's Office of Children and Family Success.These schools are distributing food to studentsThe city is delivering 1,900 meals daily with a goal to get to 10,000.The mayor also released a plan to help the homeless during the coronavirus pandemic. From the Mayor's Office of Homeless Services: 1. Emergency Shelter Assessments and TestingOn March 20, 2020, MOHS released guidance to the primary public emergency shelters.  MOHS implemented this protocol to proactively identify potential COVID infections in emergency shelter environments as quickly as possible.  It provides a process and resources for five of the public emergency shelters to assess residents for symptoms consistent with COVID, consult with a health care provider, receive a referral for testing, and be transported to an isolation site. It includes:Shelter Client Triage Screening Tool: The emergency shelters will use this tool to proactively screen all shelter residents for symptoms consistent with COVID-19.Telephonic Screening: After a positive initial screening, shelters will connect with a health provider to conduct a secondary telephonic screening.COVID-19 Testing and Isolation: If the screening is positive, the individual will be referred for COVID testing and provided with transportation.2. Hospital Discharge PracticesOn March 17, 2020, MOHS released interim guidance for hospitals to ensure the proactive assessment of housing status upon discharge, prevent unsafe reentry into congregate living environments and unsheltered locations, and provide a safe alternative for isolation.  Depending on the scenario, it includes discharge protocols to assess housing status and facilitate transfer to an isolation site or an emergency shelter bed as follows:Discharge Protocol for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19: For patients being discharged who are pending COVID-19 test results or are a confirmed case, before discharge, hospitals should complete a Housing Environment Screen to determine whether or not the individual will be able to self-isolate at home.Discharge Protocol for Patients Experiencing Homelessness when COVID-19 is NOT Suspected: For patients being discharged from the hospital who are experiencing homeless when COVID-19 is NOT suspected, the hospital may coordinate discharge to an emergency shelter by contacting the Mayor's Office of Homeless Services.3. Isolation SitesBaltimore City has secured multiple isolation sites to provide individuals experiencing homelessness and others unable to self-isolate with a safe alternative while awaiting test results and/or recovering from a COVID infection. Individuals identified through the emergency shelter assessment and hospital discharge processes are provided with transportation to a designated isolation site.  Upon arrival, MOHS staff are completing an intake process with each person and maintain ongoing contact with each individual to assess ongoing needs during the isolation process.The city of Baltimore will continue to evaluate community need and the availability of resources and modify isolation sites and supportive services.4. Expanded Capacity for Social Distancing in SheltersMOHS recognizes that with our emergency shelters filled to near capacity, the risk of communicable diseases spreading through this population is exceedingly high and there is no way to allow for shelter residents to practice the recommended level of social distancing. In response to this problem, MOHS plans to activate a social distancing shelter that will operate temporarily, at least until the COVID-19 health emergency has been contained. 5. Outreach to People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness Homeless outreach teams have shifted to tactical operations to ensure individuals experiencing street homelessness are provided with critical supplies, including hygiene products, water, food and guidance on COVID and available community resources.Additional PlanningMOHS has released interim guidance and local and national resources to all homeless service providers and community partners.  Many service providers have modified hours and services to mitigate the risk of exposure to staff and individuals experiencing homelessness. Comprehensive updates will be provided on a weekly basis and are made available on the MOHS website.MOHS will continue to pursue additional opportunities to expand capacity within and beyond emergency shelters and provide updates as they are available.PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/ekZKIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXe+7vw==             BALTIMORE

Hogan seeks presidential disaster declaration for coronavirus
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has asked for a presidential disaster declaration for the state to provide funding for state and local governments amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan asked Wednesday for a presidential disaster declaration for the state to provide funding for state and local governments amid the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||On Maryland Day, the state’s 386th birthday, Hogan recapped a timeline of the coronavirus pandemic in Maryland and expressed condolence for the four Marylanders who have died from the virus.As of Wednesday morning, Maryland has 423 cases of the coronavirus in 22 of 24 jurisdictions. "The higher numbers means we are testing more people. It doesn’t mean the percentages are going up," Hogan said. "The reality is this crisis is really just beginning." Hogan said the first state employee, University of Maryland-Baltimore County research professor Dr. Maurice Berger, died from coronavirus in New York. UMBC tweeted, "A path-breaking art historian and curator, Maurice was a fierce advocate for social justice and an exceptionally caring human being.""This will not be over in a matter of days or a matter of weeks," Hogan said. "A vast majority of people in Maryland who have tested positive are in their 40s with children as young as 10 months old."Of Maryland's confirmed coronavirus cases, nearly half -- 217 -- are between the ages of 20 and 50."The vast majority of people in our state who have tested positive so far are in their 40s and we have children as young as 10 months old who have the virus here in Maryland," Hogan said.Seventeen people have fully recovered from the coronavirus in Maryland. The governor said it's still too early to plot the apex of the outbreak in Maryland. "It is critically important that every single person remains vigilant and continues doing their part by staying in place, in their homes, as much as possible so that we can break the back of this virus," Hogan said. "What we do know is that it is not going to be over in a matter of days or even weeks."Hogan said he is continuously pushing the federal government to deliver 138,000 test kits and supplies that are desperately needed to see the scope of infections in Maryland.SCHOOLS: Maryland school Superintendent Karen Salmon announced that the closure of schools is extended for four more weeks, through at least April 24. Salmon said it's possible that there could be an extended school year. HOSPITAL SURGE PLAN: The governor's hospital surge plan has made 2,400 beds available, putting Maryland weeks ahead of schedule. The governor is directing the Maryland Department of Health to allow medical, nursing and medical technician students to staff clinics and field hospitals.The governor said there have been 2,300 people sign up for the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps since Friday. Tap here for more information.CHILD CARE: Essential personnel working in response to the coronavirus pandemic who need child care can register for these services through a free referral hotline called LOCATE: 877-261-0060."For those essential personnel that are unable to provide care, we have worked diligently in the past week to identify locations across Maryland that will provide child care," Salmon said. "While child care and day care facilities throughout the state may remain open at this time, our urgent focus is ensuring there are child-care options for the children of essential personnel."SENIORS: The governor announced $4 million in federal funding to help communities provide at-home meals for senior citizens. There is also the Senior Call Check program, which offers a daily call to check on residents at home: 866-50-CHECK.BLOOD DRIVE: Hogan said a Red Cross blood drive will be set up with the University of Maryland Medical Center to help aid in shortage during the coronavirus pandemic.TRI-STATE TRAVEL: Another measure the governor announced Wednesday include a quarantine in place order for 14 days for anyone in Maryland who has visited New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. They must also limit all contact with others for at least 14 days.W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXe+7vw==PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/UnlBIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.Prevention and treatmentThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website.For information specific to healthcare, see CDC’s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings.These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers.             ANNAPOLIS, Md.

It was built next to the University's ministry center in an area convenient to public transportation. Paisley attended the university.They broke ground on The Store last April, and Paisley said at the time that even the mechanical horse outside would be free.Williams-Paisley said at the groundbreaking that one in seven people in Nashville and one in five children face food insecurity.It opened on March 14 and is already helping families that were affected by the tornado that ripped through Nashville and the surrounding area earlier this month.Paisley said that other customers can come to The Store during its regular hours on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and will only need their ID and either proof of income, proof of residence, or statement of unemployment to shop.

Senate passes coronavirus rescue package on unanimous vote
.W
The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced.

The Senate late Wednesday passed an unparalleled $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic.The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced.The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote — and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed.“The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis," said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt."The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months."Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.Insistently optimistic, President Donald Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone's lifetime, "I don’t think it's going to end up being such a rough patch" and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it's over.The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states whose economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes, saying the legislation as written might give workers such as store clerks incentives to stay on unemployment instead of returning return to their jobs since they may earn more money if they're laid off than if they're working. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision.Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work." The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., swung behind the bipartisan agreement, saying it “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people."Senate passage delivered the legislation to the Democratic-controlled House, which will most likely pass it Friday. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber was unclear.House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington.The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.It includes a controversial, heavily negotiated $500 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.Six days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure is not an option, nor is starting over, which permitted both sides to include their priorities.“That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.”The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $130 billion. Another $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.Businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance.    Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to $330 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.

Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, “I'm telling you, these numbers don't work."                                                                                                             Social distancing efforts are working to slow coronavirus, New York Gov. Cuomo says                                                            The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., swung behind the bipartisan agreement, saying it “takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people." Senate passage delivered the legislation to the Democratic-controlled House, which will most likely pass it Friday. House members are scattered around the country and the timetable for votes in that chamber was unclear. House Democratic and Republican leaders have hoped to clear the measure for Trump's signature by a voice vote without having to call lawmakers back to Washington.                                                                                                       Fact Check: Claim of congressional pay raises in stimulus bill is false                          The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. It includes a controversial, heavily negotiated $500 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. Six days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure is not an option, nor is starting over, which permitted both sides to include their priorities. “That Washington drama does not matter any more,” McConnell said. “The Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief package today.” The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $130 billion. Another $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.                                                                                                                 Here's how much money folks can expect to get from the stimulus deal                          Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. Businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials — including Trump and his immediate family members — would be ineligible for the bill's business assistance.     Republicans won inclusion of an “employee retention” tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paycheck up to $10,000. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to $330 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters — including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.

CDC: Avoid travel to China; UMd. suspends Education Abroad amid coronavirus
.W
The University of Maryland is not authorizing travel to China until further notice amid the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday updated travel guidelines to recommend Americans avoid all nonessential travel to China amid the coronovirus outbreak.|| What we know about the coronavirus cases in the US ||The University of Maryland is not authorizing travel to China until further notice amid the outbreak of the coronavirus. The university is also suspending Education Abroad programming in China for undergraduates for spring 2020.The Wednesday announcement comes as countries evacuated citizens from China. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974 and the death toll rose to 132.The CDC believes more coronavirus cases are likely to emerge in the United States; however, the agency doesn't believe the virus poses a great risk to the general public.As of Wednesday, there were five confirmed cases in the US with other tests still pending. As of Wednesday, there were no confirmed cases of coronavirus at the University of Maryland or in Maryland. There is one possible case of coronavirus in Maryland, according to the state Department of Health, but test results are pending. || Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information on coronavirus ||The CDC is aggressively scanning for the virus, expanding entry screening to 20 U.S. ports of entry where the agency has quarantine stations. But despite the aggressive push to find new cases, there have not been any discovered yet."The situation in China is concerning; however, we are looking hard here in the United States. We will continue to be proactive," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.On Saturday, there was concern at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport when a passenger on a flight from Las Vegas who had recently traveled to China reported feeling sick. The Maryland state Department of Health reported that person did not meet the CDC criteria for coronavirus.The U.S. government returned 195 Americans who were living in Wuhan, China, to the United States. They were screened before takeoff during refueling in Alaska and post arrival. All 195 people were without symptoms."We are going to monitor them for the full extent of their incubation period," said Dr. Chris Braden, deputy director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.The CDC is most concerned about people who have recently traveled to China and people who have had close contact with those travelers."We don't think most Americans need to be especially concerned because we judge the risk in the general American public to be low," Messonnier said.The CDC reports test results are pending for 92 patients under investigation and that 68 tested negative.University of Maryland officials sent the following email to the campus community:Dear Members of the Campus Community,Information about the outbreak of novel coronavirus in China, its spread to the U.S., and other areas of the world is evolving rapidly. University leaders and the University Health Center are closely monitoring the situation and taking actions aimed at keeping our community safe and healthy. I know many of you, particularly those with programmatic or personal connections to China, have been deeply concerned about this situation, and I offer our empathy and support to those affected. I write to give you all an update of our actions and outcomes to date.At this time, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus at the University of Maryland or in the State of Maryland. We will communicate with the campus immediately if this situation changes.Yesterday, the CDC raised the level of its travel advisory to include all of China, recommending no nonessential travel to China at this time. Until further notice, the university is not authorizing travel to China, and we are suspending Education Abroad programming in China for undergraduates for spring 2020.We are continuing the effort that started last week to perform additional cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces and restrooms throughout the campus.Today, we are launching a new web page, umd.edu/virusinfo. This page will serve as the primary source of information about virus prevention, guidelines for absences from campus, FAQs and links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health resources. It also includes current information about the university’s actions and responses to coronavirus. We will continue to add and update FAQs as the coronavirus situation evolves. We urge everyone with questions or concerns to visit the site.Finally, it is imperative that we all do our part to reduce the danger of infection by observing best practices for preventing incidences of the flu and other illnesses within our community. I want to remind everyone that our University Health Center always strongly recommends that anyone who is ill or thinks they may be ill should stay home from class and from work and seek medical care, as necessary. This advice applies to everyone, every year, as well as to anyone who suspects exposure to coronavirus. The flu season is at its peak right now, and this alone would warrant such a directive. Indeed, anyone who has not received a flu vaccine this season should consider doing so immediately. Flu shots are available at the UHC.Faculty are being provided guidance today on ways to accommodate students who may need to temporarily complete assignments remotely. You will also see tips for the prevention of spreading the flu, cold and other viruses posted around campus and on social media. In addition, you may notice some individuals wearing a surgical mask to protect against infection. This does not suggest illness or presence of infection. Rather, it is simply a routine preventive practice for some.We continue to consult with coronavirus experts at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, but we are no longer testing for coronavirus infection through UMB. All testing will be coordinated through the CDC, and the local and state health departments. If you suspect that you have been exposed and are experiencing symptoms (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) report immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department or the University Health Center. If possible, call ahead to alert the facility of your symptoms and why you suspect exposure to coronavirus. When you arrive at the facility, notify personnel immediately of your symptoms and suspected exposure.We will continue to provide updates at umd.edu/virusinfo as we receive them from health officials, and we encourage you to email healthconcerns@umd.edu if you have questions specific to coronavirus. We are committed to providing information and support in this rapidly evolving situation.Sincerely,Mary Ann Rankin, senior vice president and provost             COLLEGE PARK, Md.

Maryland public schools closed for four more weeks amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
The closure of Maryland public schools amid the coronavirus pandemic has been extended for four more weeks.

The closure of Maryland public schools amid the coronavirus pandemic has been extended for four more weeks.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Maryland school Superintendent Karen Salmon announced Wednesday morning that schools will remain closed until at least April 24.Maryland public schools students have been out of school for almost two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland closed all public schools on March 16. Lessons were sent home in packets and online.Johns Hopkins Medicine: Schools are closed. Now what? Activities you can do with your child"We don't want to close down school for the rest of the year like some other states have done, but we don't want to bring kids back if they're not safe next week either," Hogan said.The superintendent and the Board of Education came to the decision after meeting Tuesday by telephone conference call. One of the major concerns is how to develop home lessons online."I am working in concert with all local school system superintendents, including multiple calls per week, in order to provide the continuity of learning to all of our students in every jurisdiction across the state of Maryland during this time," Salmon said. "Local superintendents have provided me with their plans for the continuity of learning during the additional closure period.""I know they've been working on how we get more up to speed on distance learning and being able to do more things online," Hogan said.Yara Cheikh, a Baltimore County mother, said she's concerned about families who may not have access to computers or the internet. In short, it boils down to an issue of equity."I recognize the need for the school closure, but we have 51,000 children who live in poverty in Baltimore County. We need direction, we need support and they need access to the same things that other children have across the county," Cheikh said.Salmon said it's possible that there could be an extended school year.The state teachers union, the Maryland State Education Association, sent a statement to 11 News, saying: "This is a tough decision, but the right call for the safety of our students, educators and state. The months ahead will be challenging, and we will work to make the best of them. It's heartbreaking to know that so many children will miss out on field trips, art projects, athletics, performances and the everyday enjoyment of being with friends and learning new things together."We know that virtual learning is less beneficial for students than in-person learning, and we need to do all we can to address equity issues for students without access to technology and for students entitled to special education services."We must make sure that food insecure children receive meals and that all school employees, including hourly employees, continue to receive their pay so that they can support their families. Educators have stepped up since the first day schools were closed and will continue to do all we can to support our students as we work together to overcome this crisis."Teachers in Baltimore County and across the state said they're not sure about next steps in terms of how they'll prepare lessons over the next four weeks."The whole plan going forward, it's still very uncertain and teachers are confused about what that will look like," said Cindy Sexton, president of the Teachers Association of Baltimore County. "It's a whole new world, whether we are going to do it digitally. What about the kids who don't have access? So it's another set of concerns that will come up once we get the plan from BCPS."College students in Maryland aren't going back to the classroom for the rest of the semester. Some are still waiting to find out when they can move their stuff out of their dorms. The Residential Life Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, said Wednesday that it is postponing all in-person move-outs from residence halls until further notice. Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.Prevention and treatmentThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website.For information specific to healthcare, see CDC’s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings.These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers.PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/bERkIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXe+7vw==             BALTIMORE

Angelina Jolie donates $1 million to vulnerable children amid coronavirus outbreak

“As of this week, over a billion children are out of school worldwide because of closures linked to coronavirus," Angelina Jolie said in a statement.

Actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie is helping those in need as schools across the globe have shut down, creating obstacles for many families in getting kids their meals.Jolie donated $1 million to provide food for children from low-income families, according to No Kid Hungry, a campaign of the nonprofit Share Our Strength, which seeks to end hunger and poverty."The campaign has already given $2M to date to 78 organizations across 30 states," according to No Kid Hungry officials. "This week, the campaign issued new emergency grants to school districts, food banks and community organizations feeding kids nationwide and in Louisiana, Texas, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Maine and Oklahoma." Jolie said in a statement: “As of this week, over a billion children are out of school worldwide because of closures linked to coronavirus. Many children depend on the care and nutrition they receive during school hours, including nearly 22 million children in America who rely on food support. No Kid Hungry is making resolute efforts to reach as many of those children as possible.”Parents and caregivers seeking meals for children in five states and counting can text the word “FOOD” (or “COMIDA”) to 877-877 to find emergency food distribution sites in their neighborhoods, No Kid Hungry officials said, noting the service is currently active in Colorado, Hawaii, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. More states are expected to be added over the next few weeks as meal site data becomes available.

Trucking industry sees boost in production amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
One industry that has seen a big boost in production because of the coronavirus is trucking, and that's good news for the supply chain.

One industry that has seen a big boost in production because of the coronavirus is trucking, and that's good news for the supply chain.Truck stops like the one in Jessup and all over the United States are still crowded, but the highways are not because everyone has been instructed to stay home.Because of this, speed limits are up and some drivers are making deliveries in record time.“It's nice man. It's much easier, it's much easier,” said truck driver Clayton Mbuvi. A number of truck drivers 11 News talked to said it's never been easier to get from point A to point B.“It was just congestion and now it's like you're driving right on through, you're doing the speed limit it's very easy-going it's relaxed,” said truck driver Mark Risdon. “We're seeing significant changes in average truck speeds around the country,” said Rebecca Brewster, president of the American Transportation Research Institute. WBAL-TV 11 News spoke with Brewster about a recent survey they did on average speeds on highways around the country.One intersection in the report, I-95 at I-395 showed a dramatic increase in speed. The average in 2019 was 25 mph, and just a couple years ago averaged 55.“Really a silver lining to come out of this COVID-19 crisis, it's injecting a lot of efficiency into the supply chain that we haven't seen in a while because of the significant impact of traffic congestion,” said Brewster.According to Atri's Analysis, because of the coronavirus situation, commuter traffic has been reduced so trucks can operate at higher speeds, particularly during rush hour.Trucks are also able to be more efficient and keep the 24-hour cycle going strong.Because now more than ever, these driver's jobs are key to keeping the supply chain running smoothly.TA Truck stops wanted to make it clear their restaurants and convenience stores remain open to truckers for carryout as food is a tough commodity these days on the road.

Be wary of emails asking for your financial support to "save humanity" or defeat the coronavirus.

Be wary of emails asking for your financial support to "save Humanity" or defeat the coronavirus. Scammers and cyberattackers are using the confusion and fear around the novel coronavirus to take advantage of unsuspecting people looking to help. Barracuda Networks, a cyber firm, has noted a huge surge in malware and phishing attempts recently. Mark Albert recently spoke with Fleming Shi, chief technology officer of Barracuda Networks, to understand why the attacks are happening and how others can spot them. Shi's team found coronavirus-related email attacks rose by as much as 667% since March 1. A new ransomware attack has even adopted the disease's name."Have you ever seen such a spike in such a short amount of time?" Albert asked."It's a big surprise to us, yeah," Shi said.The attacks have moved up from just scams and phishing, now to blackmail. One attack, spotted more than a thousand times, threatened to infect the victim and their family with the coronavirus."So they're really attacking people's fear, right?" Shi said. "I feel like this is pure evil. We've got to defend ourselves." The Department of Homeland Security this month issued an alert about COVID-19 scams, including those online, on mobile, and on the phone. The Federal Trade Commission also issued a coronavirus consumer warning."A lot of people will end up falling for — to become a victim, falling for this type of scams," Shi warned.The U.S. Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency urges the public to report to it any coronavirus-related  scams or vulnerabilities.

Second arrest made in grocery store murder of Carmen Rodriguez
.W
A second arrest has been made in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez, who was shot dead inside her family-owned grocery store in east Baltimore, Baltimore City police announced Thursday afternoon.

Baltimore police announced a handful of murder arrests within the past two weeks, most notably, an arrest in the murder of Carmen Rodriguez.Rodriguez was killed in front of her children at her family-owned grocery store in December 2019.To say Rodriguez was a staple in this southeast Baltimore neighborhood is an understatement. Her life was celebrated, and on the street corner on N. Kenwood, they renamed the street "Carmen Rodriguez Way."On Thursday, police announced a second arrest and her murder hoping to offer closure for her family."I'm proud to announce that we have arrested 39-year-old Martin Brooks with the Dec. 22 homicide that occurred in the 100 block of North Kenwood Avenue," said Police Commissioner Michael Harrison.Harrison said a number of key clues led to the arrest."That’s going to be good detective work, community support and tireless and relentless effort to make sure we find who did this and hold people accountable," he said.Back on Dec. 22, 2019, surveillance video released to the public showed 29-year-old Terrance Peterson and Brooks entering the Kim Grocery & Deli on Kenwood Avenue.Charging documents revealed Peterson entered the store, bought some items and left, then got into a waiting car where the passenger, Brooks then exited, went into the store and held Rodriguez at gunpoint while the cash register was being emptied. He then fired one shot killing her."She was a beautiful woman, mother of four, hard-working 15-16 hours a day trying to make an honest living, then some animal just comes in here," said Derrick Galan, Rodriguez's husband. At the time, Galan called out the police department for not doing enough. Friends of hers gathered outside the store Thursday to express relief."It’s an impact for the neighborhood because now we know that the person that took such a caring person away is gone," said Shenee Jones, Rodriguez's friend.Brooks is facing a long list of charges including, first-degree murder.Police said the case is still under investigation. ​             BALTIMORE

Appeals grow to close US national parks during coronavirus outbreak
.W
The Trump administration is sticking with its waiver of entrance fees at national parks during the coronavirus outbreak. Some aren't loving that.

The Trump administration is sticking with its crowd-friendly waiver of entrance fees at national parks during the coronavirus pandemic, as managers at some parks try and fail to keep visitors a safe distance apart and communities appeal for a shutdown at the parks still open.Vice President Mike Pence has said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would provide specific health guidance on Thursday about national parks and the coronavirus.While the Interior Department agreed this week to requests from local managers of Yellowstone and some other national parks to close, others remained open and newly free of charge. In Arizona, local governments and the Navajo Nation were waiting for an answer Thursday on their request earlier this week for federal officials to shut down Grand Canyon National Park as cases of the coronavirus grow in surrounding areas.“We think it’s just in the best interest of the community, the visitors and the staff,” said Lena Fowler, a supervisor in Coconino County, which includes the Grand Canyon. “What we’re really concerned about is making sure everyone is safe.”The National Park Service is deciding whether to shut down individual sites on a park-by-park basis, in consultation with state and local health officials, Nicholas Goodwin, a spokesman for Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, said Thursday.Goodwin said Bernhardt’s decision earlier this month to waive entrance fees was meant to give a financial break to those visitors who had decided they wanted to go, not to draw people outdoors and together on vistas and trails as coranavirus deaths and illnesses grow. “It was not meant to create a flood of people to national parks,” Goodwin said.The Trump administration agreed last week to close some parks, including Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the Great Smoky Mountains, after requests from the park managers.At the Great Smoky Mountains, the number of visitors last week was even up from the previous year, with about 30,000 people entering the park each day. Park spokeswoman Dana Soehn said in a phone interview that despite efforts to protect staff and visitors from COVID-19, including closing restrooms and visitor centers, the park found it impossible to keep people from crowding together in popular spots. The day after the closure announcement, park officials learned that an employee had tested positive for COVID-19.“We looked at different models, including closing just the highly congested trails, but in the end, we decided to support the local community efforts to decrease unnecessary travel,” she said. Elsewhere, the area around the still-open Zion National Park in Utah is seeing hundreds of tourists, even though visitation has dropped precipitously because of worldwide travel restrictions, said Larry Hamill, manager of Zion Rock Mountain Guides. Related video: Do’s and Don’ts When Visiting a National ParkRangers have occasionally had to halt traffic because the limited parking near trailheads is full, he said. In the United States, deaths from COVID-19 topped 1,150 Thursday, and there were over 80,000 confirmed coronavirus cases. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.Current CDC recommendations call for canceling "all U.S. events of 10-plus people" when there is a “minimal or moderate spread of COVID-19 in the community.”Criticism grew of the Interior Department’s stance on the national parks.“I just don’t understand what’s going on in terms of the senior leadership,” regarding cutting the entrance fees and keeping national parks open, said Kristen Brengel, a senior official with the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group on park policy.National parks, including the Grand Canyon, have roads and trails designed to funnel visitors en masse to see views and wildlife, Brengel said. “They know they can’t keep people safe there,” she said. National Park Service spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said Thursday that the agency is working with Grand Canyon staff to review documentation the park sent in a bid to close.In an email to Grand Canyon staff this week, the park said it included information on the limitations of its public health system, wastewater treatment and emergency responders.The Coconino County Board of Supervisors, the Grand Canyon Chamber of Commerce and the Navajo Nation sent letters this week asking for at least a temporary closure of Grand Canyon National Park. The park gets more than 6 million visitors a year, but it’s also home year-round to about 2,000 people, including a small community of Havasupai tribal members. The spread of the coronavirus quickly could overwhelm a small clinic at the national park.The Navajo Nation, which has 69 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, closed tribal parks, placed restrictions on businesses and issued a stay-at-home order for residents on the vast 27,000-square-mile (70,000-square-kilometer) reservation that extends into Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.“We are experiencing constant traffic through Navajo communities, and we simply cannot afford any additional outbreaks among our Navajo people, non-Navajo residents or those tourists travelling through the Navajo Nation,” tribal President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer wrote in the letter. Picavet said the service had not yet decided whether to recommend Bernhardt close Grand Canyon as requested by the local authorities. Goodwin gave no timeline for a decision.

They have a very difficult job that requires them to place their lives on the line in order to protect the public’s health. We all owe them a debt of gratitude," Young said in a statement.The Baltimore City Health Department is conducting a contact trace investigation in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.The fire chief said the members who tested positive are quarantined at home."We are taking this discovery very seriously," Fire Chief Niles Ford said. "The last thing we want to do is marginalize our ability to serve the public, while we attempt to maintain our level of quality service. Once COVID-19 made its way in Maryland, specifically Baltimore City, everyone in the department received protocols and guidelines about protecting themselves and the community from this nationwide pandemic."The police commissioner said the officer is in good spirits. When the officer learned that they may have been exposed to the virus, the officer self-quarantined for over a week. The officer remains quarantined and is recovering."This member has been off for over a week, while awaiting their test results," Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said.

The big go-to for people these days are grocery stores. People are picking up and stocking up on groceries, prescriptions and other items. And the response from stores to keep the public and workers safe continues to evolve.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Stores started by offering hand sanitizer and cart wipes to customers. Now, stores, like Giant Food, are putting up barriers.Keeping grocery stores stocked and cleaned is an ongoing effort. Giant employees are wiping down monitors, credit card swipers and counters. Now, stores are getting plexiglass screens."We are about two-thirds of the way through all of our stores. We will be complete by the end of this week in all stores. Those screens are being installed at every single cash register, between the customer and the payment station," said Ira Kress, Giant's interim president.The plexiglass is being installed at all 155 of Giant's pharmacy stores on the pharmacy counters, customer service desks and in stores that offer Starbucks services.While the barriers are new to customers, it's a move they applaud. Richard Savanuck's wife is expecting, and he's taking precautions and is glad the store is, too."It makes sense. It's for the safety of the workers. All these people are risking their health for us. It's the best thing for everyone now. I think it's smart that they are doing it," Savanuck said."It's good to take any preventive measure you can," said Harvey Forman, a customer. "It was weird."Giant's not alone with the effort. Harris Teeter is doing the same. Both Aldi and Wegman's websites said they are in the process of installing barriers, too.Giant said it's too soon to say whether the plexiglass will be a permanent fixture. Not only are the stores working on cleanliness, they are hiring and they've increased wages.             OWINGS MILLS, Md.

Trader Joes in Elkridge closes after employee suspected positive with coronavirus
.W
A Trader Joe's grocery store in Elkridge closed its doors Tuesday after an employee is expected to have a positive case of coronavirus.

A Trader Joe's grocery store in Elkridge closed its doors Tuesday after an employee is expected to have a positive case of coronavirus.According to Trader Joe's website, this is one of three stores closed because of the coronavirus pandemic -- the two other stores are in New York.There was no shortage of shoppers trying to go into the Elkridge Trader Joe's Tuesday, only to be greeted with a closed sign on the door.“We just came here to go shopping, grab a few things,” said shopper Karen Williams. The sign on the door said a crew member tested positive or is receiving treatment for a suspected case of coronavirus. The store is closed for cleaning.“I mean they definitely should clean it out if there's someone there that tested positive. I mean, I wouldn't want to go in there knowing that, so I would feel more comfortable going in there after they cleaned it out for sure,” said shopper Aarthi Ambrosi.The sign said the employee was last in the store Monday and anyone who visited the store in the two weeks prior should contact the Howard County Health Department with concerns.“We were just here last week, last Tuesday ‘cause we come here on Tuesday. Now I'm kind of concerned,” said Williams. “That's part of the risk of going out, but like I said, I'm trying to get some supplies for my parents who don't want to be out and about, so I'm willing to take that risk I guess,” said shopper Vidya Ambrosi. It's a sober reminder that anyone can become infected with the coronavirus and potentially pass it on. Health officials said the best way to stay healthy is to stay home. if you must go out, avoid close contact with others, wash your hands often and don't touch your face.WBAL-TV 11 News reached out to the Howard County Health Department to get more information, but they were not available for an interview.There is no word on when the store will reopen.On Thursday, the health department said there is no need for the public to to quarantine if they shopped at Trader Joe's. The Howard County Government said: "To clarify the situation regarding Trader Joe’s, the Health Department is pleased that Trader Joe’s decided to take action and clean its facility after believing that an employee may have exhibited symptoms similar to COVID-19.  We are concerned that reporting the information without sufficient detail about the situation and without engaging the Health Department was premature and did not allow for the appropriate investigation to take place in order to determine true exposure risk to the public.""Based upon our investigation, there is no need for the public to quarantine if they shopped at Trader Joe’s. We remind everyone to self-monitor, contact a healthcare provider if they become ill, follow social distancing guidance, stay home and only go out only as needed, wash hands, wipe down commonly touched surfaces, and don't touch face with your hands.

NFL says draft is still on — but public not invited

The NFL says it is exploring “innovative options" for how the process will be handled and will provide that information as it becomes available.

The NFL Draft will continue as scheduled April 23-25, according to a memo from Commissioner Roger Goodell obtained by several news outlets. Last week, Goodell announced that the draft would take place as scheduled, but under a modified format without public events. Goodell's latest memo, obtained by ESPN and NFL.com,  says "public discussion of issues relating to the draft serves no useful purpose and is grounds for disciplinary action.""Everyone recognizes that public health conditions are highly uncertain and there is no assurance that we can select a different date and be confident that conditions will be significantly more favorable than they are today," Goodell's memo says. The memo says prospects and their families will not attend the draft and encourages teams to plan "to conduct draft operations in a location outside of your facility, with a limited number of people present, and with sufficient technology resources to allow you to communicate internally, with other clubs, and with draft headquarters."Last week's announcement said the draft will be televised regardless of its venue or format.“In consideration of current information related to COVID-19 and guidance from medical experts such as the CDC, and in coordination with public authorities in Nevada and the city of Las Vegas, the NFL will modify its plans,” the league said in a statement.The NFL says it is exploring “innovative options" for how the process will be handled and will provide that information as it becomes available."This decision reflects our foremost priority: the health and safety of all fans and citizens," Goodell said. "While this outcome is disappointing both to the NFL and to the Las Vegas community, we look forward to partnering with the Raiders, the city of Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority for a future NFL draft as well as evaluating opportunities for other major NFL events in Las Vegas in the future, including the Super Bowl."

President Trump previews new social distancing guidelines based on geographic risks
.W
President Donald Trump told state governors his administration was preparing to issue new, potentially more relaxed social distancing guidelines.

President Donald Trump told state governors on Thursday his administration was preparing to issue new, potentially more relaxed social distancing guidelines based on geographic risk factors for the novel coronavirus, even as some health experts warn it's too early to allow Americans to congregate in large groups or return to their workplaces.In a letter, Trump said COVID-19 testing capabilities would allow his administration to identify "high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk" counties where different levels of social distancing would be appropriate."Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria, developed in close coordination with the Nation's public health officials and scientists, to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus," he wrote.New, more tailored guidelines will help governors and other state policymakers decide on "maintaining, increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place," Trump wrote.The president has been itching to loosen the 15-day social distancing measures he announced last week in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.During an early evening news conference, Trump repeatedly stressed the U.S. "has to go back to work" but suggested social distancing guidelines could be used as they returned."When we are open, as soon as we open, that doesn't mean you will be stop the guidelines. You will still try and distance yourself. Maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life, but the timing is coming," Trump said.Even as he's agitated to relax the guidelines, however, some state governors have implemented new restrictions on nonessential businesses and large gatherings.Trump said this week that he'd like to see the country "raring to go" by Easter, on April 12, a date that many health experts say is unlikely."There is still a long battle ahead, but our efforts are already paying dividends," he wrote in the letter. "As we enhance protections against the virus, Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic, social and religious lives."Some of Trump's health advisers have warned that loosening guidelines on social distancing before the virus is contained would worsen its spread. They have cautioned against creating arbitrary deadlines on reopening the country."You've got to understand that you don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, said on CNN on Wednesday. "So you've got to respond in what you see happen. And if you keep seeing this acceleration, it doesn't matter what you say. One week, two weeks, three weeks -- you've got to go with what the situation on the ground is."Trump has insisted that as conditions improve in certain areas of the country, or don't devolve into large outbreaks, that business should be able to return to normal.But he's also said that widespread testing isn't necessary in those areas because they don't have large caseloads."We could go to certain states right now that have virtually no problem or a very small problem. We don't have to test the entire state in the Mid-West, or wherever they may be. We don't have to test the entire state. I think it's ridiculous. We don't have to do it," he said during a briefing at the White House on Wednesday. "A lot of those states could go back right now, and they probably will because at some point in the not-too-distant future, certain states are going to come off the rails."On the call, Trump reiterated his view that the country needs to reopen soon and that not every place needs to be under the same restrictions. He said certain places had almost no problems with the virus and shouldn't be kept to the same restrictions as areas with high case loads.Some governors on the call thanked Trump for moving away from a nationwide guidance, saying it didn't work for their states.But others were less enthusiastic. Trump and Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee got into a heated discussion over Trump's unwillingness to use the Defense Production Act to secure more equipment for states.Inslee told Trump he needed to act as the "Tom Brady" of the response effort after Trump said the federal government would act as the "backup" for states' own efforts. Trump said the federal government had already done plenty for Washington State.Other governors weren't as combative but did raise some issues with how the federal government has handled the situation, including access to tests.CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.

MLB uniform maker switches to producing medical masks, gowns
.W
The company hopes to produce nearly 15,000 masks and gowns a day.

The Bryce Harper jersey that could have been worn this baseball season by the biggest Philadelphia Phillies fan is now a protective mask in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.Fanatics, the company that manufactures uniforms for Major League Baseball, has suspended production on jerseys and is instead using the polyester mesh fabric to make masks and gowns for hospitals in Pennsylvania and nearby states.New York Yankees and Phillies pinstripes were still in vogue on baseball's scheduled opening day -- only stitched on the protective wear made by the apparel company.Michael Rubin, the founder and executive chairman of Fanatics, was watching TV last week when he was struck by the idea to turn the 360,000-square-foot facility in Easton, Pennsylvania, into a factory for the COVID-19 virus fight.While Rubin considered how he could make it happen, St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem reached out to Fanatics late last week about the possibility of the company manufacturing masks. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Attorney General Josh Shapiro each contacted Rubin over the weekend and told him the state was in "dire need" of more masks and gowns.Fanatics developed a prototype that was approved by the state's emergency agency and by Tuesday the company halted production of all baseball jerseys.Related video: Americans sew face masks for health workersRubin, a limited ownership partner of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils, said he had the blessing of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to stop producing jerseys."We've got a million yards of fabric that we make these baseball uniforms from, what would you think if we take that fabric and make masks and gowns," Rubin told The Associated Press. "He immediately said, 'Great. I want to do it immediately. The most important thing is we've got to help the heroes on the front line and baseball can help play a role in it.'"So with Manfred's support, production on the $300 jerseys for Harper, Aaron Judge, Mookie Betts and the rest of baseball's brightest stars was stopped. The company makes the uniforms for MLB and Nike.Fanatics stated fashioning masks and gowns on Tuesday and Rubin hoped to produce nearly 15,000 masks and gowns a day. Rubin, whose Reform Alliance lobbies for changes to state probation and parole laws, said the demand was for 95 percent masks. The production plant had been shut down as a nonessential business but about 100 workers have returned to work for Fanatics.The company is making Level 1 masks, used for low-risk, nonsurgical procedures that are for single-use only.Rubin said Wolf told Fanatics they would pay for the masks and gowns. Rubin, though, said he spoke to Manfred and Fanatics teamed with MLB to provide hospital uniforms at no cost to those in need in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.Rubin, who has a net worth of $2.3 billion according for Forbes, said it would cost Fanatics about $3 million to make the masks and gowns and the company would produce at least 1 million over the course of several months.And if you are one of the few Phillies fans left who doesn't have a Harper jersey but want one?"I think we've got them, but I'm not 100% sure," Rubin said with a laugh. "I know we can get a mask and a jersey made from one."There was a bit of a dust-up this week when the Devils and 76ers did an about-face on cutting salaries for employees making more than $100,000. A day after announcing the temporary 20% pay cuts because of the economics effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the teams' co-owners rescinded them.“As an organization, I don't believe we got right up front,” Rubin said. “But I believe we got it right. I think people who know me, know I'm a transparent person. I believe when you get something wrong, you just kind of fix it. Ultimately, as an organization, we fixed it. I'm proud the organization came together and did the right thing by our employees. I think we'll be rewarded by our employees who will feel we did the right thing. We got to the right place."But when it comes to Fanatics assisting in the coronavirus fight, Rubin added, “we're less worried about manufacturing jerseys and more worried about just saving lives.”                         The Bryce Harper jersey that could have been worn this baseball season by the biggest Philadelphia Phillies fan is now a protective mask in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus
.W
The British prime minister was tested after showing mild symptoms.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus, the first leader of a major nation to contract COVID-19, but he insisted Friday that he remains in charge of the U.K.'s response to the outbreak.Johnson, 55, said he was tested Thursday on the advice of the country's chief medical officer after showing "mild symptoms" of a temperature and a persistent cough."I've taken a test, that's come out positive so I am working from home, I am self-isolating, and that's entirely the right thing to do," Johnson said in a video message posted on his Twitter account."But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus." Health Secretary Matt Hancock was also confirmed to have the virus.Hancock, 41, tweeted: "Thankfully my symptoms are mild."Johnson is the highest-profile political leader to have contracted the virus, which has infected more than 500,000 people around the world.The diagnoses of Johnson and Hancock are the latest evidence that no one — no matter how high-profile — is untouched by the global pandemic.Politicians may be especially exposed, since they meet large numbers of people and hold multiple meetings daily. Britain's Parliament continued to meet as the virus spread, before it was eventually suspended Tuesday.On Friday, health officials said Britain had 14,579 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 759 people have died — 181 deaths in 24 hours, the highest daily toll yet.Elsewhere in the world, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa have all been tested and found to be negative. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is self-isolating after his wife tested positive for COVID-19.Britain's government is run from a series of interconnected buildings centered on 10 Downing St. and adjoining houses — a warren of rooms and narrow corridors that is both the prime minister's home and the workplace of hundreds of people.Johnson's spokesman, James Slack, said the prime minister was self-isolating in his apartment, which is above 11 Downing St., and would have his meals left outside his door by staff."For now the prime minister's symptoms are mild and he is continuing to do all of the same functions he was performing before. The only difference is he will now have to do that by teleconferencing," Slack said.He would not say whether Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, was currently living at Downing St.Slack said several other Downing St. staff are self-isolating but he did not know of any other confirmed cases.The government said that if Johnson is unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will replace him.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and sometimes death.Johnson has met in person with some senior ministers and officials this week, and has appeared at press conferences alongside his top medical and scientific advisers.On Thursday evening, Johnson stood outside his front door to join in a national round of applause for health care workers. Slack said the prime minister was careful to observe social distancing rules while he did so, standing several meters away from Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, who also took part.Earlier this week Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, announced that he had tested positive for the virus. His mother, 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, is self-isolating at Windsor Castle as a precaution.Buckingham Palace said Johnson and the queen last met on March 11. The pair have held their weekly audience by phone for the past two weeks.Johnson has been criticized by his opponents for his Conservative government's initial reluctance to impose tough restrictions on movement and the economy to try to stem the spread of the virus. Early this month, Johnson recounted shaking hands with medics treating coronavirus patients at a hospital and said, "I continue to shake hands."The government's initial advice was that people should wash their hands frequently. As the number of cases soared, the escalated to include the closure of schools, bars, restaurants and nonessential shops, a nationwide order for everyone but key workers to stay home.Johnson's diagnosis comes at the end of a week when he effectively closed down much of the British economy and introduced strict curbs on people's day-to-day movements. The pound suffered a knee-jerk retreat in the immediate aftermath of Johnson's disclosure but had soon recouped most of those losses and was trading 0.5% higher on the day at $1.2257. In his Twitter video, Johnson thanked everyone in the public services for their "amazing national effort" and praised everyone who is staying at home."That's the way we're going to win," he said.Johnson's political opponents wished him well. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, wished the prime minister a speedy recovery and relayed his hope that his family is "safe and healthy." Corbyn said everyone's health "depends on everybody else."             LONDON, England

Focus on this, contact lens wearers of the world: To reduce the spread of coronavirus, experts suggest it's time to put your contact lenses on the shelf and dazzle the world with your frames.That's because wearing glasses can help you stop touching your face, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, a key way any virus is spread, including the novel coronavirus currently spreading across the world.Why contact lenses?Contact lens users not only touch their eyes to put in and remove their lenses twice or more a day, they also touch their eyes and face much more than people who don't wear contacts, said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology."You touch your eye and then you touch another part of your body," said Steinemann, an ophthalmologist at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio."You rub your eyes, then rub your face, scratch your face, put your fingers in your mouth, put your fingers in your nose," he added. "Some people are not very hygienic and may have forgotten to first wash their hands."Glasses may also provide a tiny bit more protection from any coronavirus virus particles floating in the air, Steinemann said, although it's more likely that you'd be infected via your mouth and nose than your eye.While critical for any health professional taking care of patients with COVID-19, for the rest of us "it's just another preventative, another way in which you can add a filter to help yourself stay away from a coronavirus," Steinemann said.In case you're wondering, it's not likely you can get the novel coronavirus - or any virus -- from the eye itself."Can you end up with with COVID-19 from the virus entering through the eye? Theoretically, it's possible, but we have no proof of that," he added."It's possible, I guess, but I've always thought that that was a bit of a stretch," said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.Pink eye connectionWhat's more likely is that this new coronavirus could cause conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition also known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid."Conjunctiva is modified mucus membrane, like the inside of your mouth or the inside of your nose or nasal cavity and pharynx," Steinemann said."It's moist and nice and hospitable for viruses. In fact there's lots of organisms that can stick very readily to your conjunctiva, or for that matter, stick on a contact lens that is also resting on your conjunctiva," he added.Symptoms of conjunctivitis include tearing, itching or burning, blurred vision, red or "pink" in the whites of the eye, pus, mucus and a yellow discharge that can crusts over the eyelashes, often sticking the eyes together after sleep.Reports from China and around the world are showing that about 1% to 3% of people with COVID-19, also had conjunctivitis.This is concerning because the coronavirus can spread by touching fluid from an infected person's eyes, or from objects that person has touched which then carry the fluid.The news caused more than a dozen national eye organizations to tell ophthalmologists to stop seeing patients for anything but urgent or emergency care, such as eye injuries. That includes both office and surgical care."Each of us has a societal responsibility to not function as a vector of a potentially fatal disease," the academy said in its announcement. "This is an existential crisis. We as physicians must respond to it and support our colleagues and our communities. Be safe."A newly released study by the American Academy of Ophthalmology found no evidence that people with COVID-19 were shedding the virus from their tears, but no one in the study had conjunctivitis. So it's still unknown if the novel coronavirus can be spread by tears.Don't panicThat doesn't mean that any red or pinkish eye will be a sign of COVID-19, experts stress.The novel coronavirus is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis; in fact, it's so common that it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered COVID-19 virus would do the same. There are numerous viruses and bacteria responsible for the common cold that can cause pink eye, as can fungi, amoebas and parasites picked up from swimming in contaminated waters. Allergic reactions to smoke or dust, shampoos, pool chlorine, even eye drops can be to blame.Plus there are many other, often benign causes of pink eye: seasonal allergies; a sty, which is a clogged eye duct or a sort of "eye pimple;" a chalazion, which is an inflammation of the gland along the eyelid; blepharitis, another inflammation or infection of the skin along the eyelid; or iritis, an inflammation of the colored part of your eye called the iris.None of those conditions are contagious.Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other tell-tale symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.Or it could just be allergies, especially if you've been sneezing and your eyes and nose are itchy.Regardless, this is a time to be conscientious about social distancing at 6 feet and practicing good self-hygiene -- washing hands (the right way) at every opportunity and not touching your face. Which leads us back to putting up your contact lens for a while."This is not the time to cut corners," Steinemann said. "Always wash your hands, always use hand sanitizer. Don't touch your face. Don't rub your eye. Right? And disinfect your contact lenses."If you keep wearing them at all.

VIDEO: Aquarium closed due to the coronavirus welcomes shelter puppies for visit

ADORABLE! Carmel and Odie got to explore the aquarium and make some new friends!

The Georgia Aquarium is closed to the public because of coronavirus restrictions, so some adorable puppies got to visit.Carmel and Odie got to scamper around in the aquarium's underwater tunnel and explore the Ocean Voyager gallery, in a video posted on social media by the aquarium and the Atlanta Humane Society.The pups, who are siblings, are about 8 weeks old and are probably some sort of terrier mix, Christina Hill with the Atlanta Humane Society said."They are very cute and scruffy, aren't they?" she said.The puppies didn't seem too interested in the whale sharks, blackbar soldierfish, rays, bowmouth guitarfish or the other species swimming around in the 6.3 million-gallon habitat.In fact, they were pretty easily distracted and ended up playing with each other and sniffing the air conditioning vents before curling up together for a nap.The fish, for their part, mostly carried on with their regular business and didn't pay much attention to the puppies.A curious grouper did swim up to the window, seeming to check them out.Carmel and Odie are living with a foster family right now and are not yet available for adoption, Hill said.The Atlanta Humane Society has about 200 animals in foster homes, Hill said, and is only doing limited adoptions because of the coronavirus outbreak.  Hill said there's been a fair amount of interest in adopting Carmel and Odie and that they'll be looking for a "forever home" once the Atlanta Humane Society reopens to the public.Want to keep up with the big fish while in quarantine? The Georgia Aquarium has a number of live webcams running, in addition to doing online education programs for people who want to visit from home.

Multiple routes are experiencing service impacts Wednesday after a Maryland Transit Administration operator tested positive for the novel coronavirus, MDOT MTA officials said.

Multiple routes experienced service disruptions Wednesday after a Maryland Transit Administration operator tested positive for the coronavirus, MDOT MTA officials said.According to union officials, the driver said she is doing OK, under the circumstances. She is in home quarantine with her two children.Riders 11 News spoke with are taking extra precautions, but otherwise unfazed by news the bus driver tested positive for coronavirus.“I'm all geared up. I got gloves on, got my hat on, didn't touch anything and nobody sat beside me,” said bus rider Roslyn Dupree.“They say six feet is the idea, six feet, but I don't think you can do that on a bus -- kind of impossible. I'm trying to keep my distance,” said Vincent Davis, another bus rider.“I’m, 93-years-old. I was with Gen. McArthur in the Philippines,” said bus rider Mike Kamiski, who also nothing phases him.The driver who contracted coronavirus worked out of the Eastern division. State officials issued a statement saying, in part, “Out of an abundance of caution, MDOT MTA has closed the eastern bus division so that it can undergo a thorough cleaning and disinfecting.”Michael McMillan, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300, is directing Eastern district employees, which includes some 200 bus drivers, to self-quarantine.“She don't know where she got it from, so the person she may have got it from may be still in that division or once again, she may have got it from the outside. We need to take every caution every precaution necessary in order to have public safety,” said McMillan.Union officials contend the state could do more to protect drivers and the public. They suggest limited operating hours staggering work shifts, supplying drivers with masks and gloves, more signage to educate the public.“I do feel as though the public being safe and operators as well first and foremost to be safe is the main concern for that,” said McMillan. According to union officials, the bus driver became ill last Thursday, which was also the last time she worked. She got a drive through test on Monday and the results came back positive this Tuesday.As a result of the temporary closure, the following routes will experience service impacts:CityLink Navy, Orange, Blue, Pink, Lime and Gold LocalLink 21, 22, 28,36, 56, 59, 62, 63, and 65Express BusLink 105, 120, and 160MDOT MTA encourages riders to use transit for essential travel only. Essential travel means taking trips to work, hospitals, health care providers, pharmacies, grocery stores, banks, food distribution centers, schools, to provide care for family members and other similar destinations.  MDOT MTA is working diligently to reopen the Eastern bus division as quickly as possible.W2lmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vZDJjbXZicTdzeHgzM2ouY2xvdWRmcm9udC5uZXQvZW1haWwvcHJvZF9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1c19pZnJhbWVfYXJ0aWNsZS5odG1sIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxNCIgc3R5bGU9IndpZHRoOjEwMCU7Ym9yZGVyOm5vbmU7b3ZlcmZsb3c6aGlkZGVuIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3dUcmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiXVsvaWZyYW1lXQ==             BALTIMORE

'Daddy' Logan remembered for delicious bread, fearlessness on golf course
.W
"You got to have confidence, if you don't have confidence you can't do anything," Logan said in 1988.

A man Jacob "Daddy" Logan figured out a way to help communities lacking certain resources. He became an entrepreneur, selling bread and operating a traveling store, among other things. One thing is for sure is he loved a challenge."You got to have confidence, if you don't have confidence you can't do anything," Logan said in 1988.Logan had more than confidence -- he had visions for how he could help his community.  While working at Bethlehem Steel in 1945, he and his wife, Estelle, moved to Cherry Hill.  After the war, he left the docks to start a bread business, restaurants and grocery stores to raise his family. He started out by bringing goods to those who had no store in their community. He had a bus and later a truck."He had candy, he had all the things a woman would need for the household, as far as cleaning and also things from the pharmacy, like aspirin and those types of things," said his daughter Francesca Brooks.Brooks said after a while, her father decided to go into the bread business. Daddy Logan's Bread was sold in stores all over the city."So, Daddy would purchase himself some trucks so that they could go out to Baltimore City, Mount Winan, Cherry Hill, parts of Brooklyn and Glen Bernie. Then Hauswald's said, 'Mr. Logan, I'm making more of your bread than my bread. You're competing with me,'" Brooks said.So, he found another company to make his bread. In 1993, Logan retired and returned to one of his first loves: golf. He had been a caddy in his earlier years and tried to learn then, but segregation kept him off the greens. At 73 years old, he taught himself to play golf and would later be a fixture on courses throughout Maryland, at Carroll Park, Forest Park, Pasadena and even at Pinehurst Golf Course in North Carolina."I play every day. Most days, it's nice -- not raining or snowing," said golfer John Clark.Those who saw Logan on the links will tell you he was something else."He used to brag and say he could beat this person and beat that person. He had a certain personality. Also had a way with him where he had a certain charm and elegance," Clark said.His van advertised his fearlessness, bragging he could go anywhere to play anyone who wants to play."He said he would play all the men that were his age and he would beat them," said golfer Vernon Bailey. "When you saw him play, you would think, if he can do it, I can do it."Logan passed away in 2017 at the age of 97. He drove and played golf up until the end. Brooks said her father always wanted his story told."He wanted to continue when segregation was over to show that a black man is not limited to anything. He can do anything he wants to do, but all he has to do is have that dream," Brooks said.​             BALTIMORE

Baltimore startup donates toilet paper due to coronavirus outbreak

A Baltimore start-up's initial plan to sell toilet paper, quickly evolved into a plan to donate toilet paper when the coronavirus led to bare shelves at grocery stores.

A Baltimore start-up's initial plan to sell toilet paper, quickly evolved into a plan to donate toilet paper when the coronavirus led to bare shelves at grocery stores.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||After seven days and more than 100 deliveries, members of the Lor Tush team have accomplished their goal.The two sisters from west Baltimore and their friend have donated 1,000 rolls of toilet paper to people all over Baltimore City."All our friends, they're artists, they're musicians, they're servers. They work in the service industry and everyone's out on their luck, so we were like, okay, let's do what we can to at least take one stress away," said April Isa of Lor Tush. They were planning to launch their Lor Tush toilet paper business later this year, but then came the coronavirus outbreak and the empty toilet paper shelves at grocery stores.They already had a lot of toilet paper, so they started taking requests for free donations"And next thing you know, we've got like thousands of submissions and like, we were just hopping in our cars and were delivering them," said April Isa. "A lot of people who reached out to us are immune-compromised and they're telling us they can't go out themselves to get toilet paper and if they wanted to, there's none on the shelves.""We really did do a good thing. Let's see how we can keep this momentum going. Everybody needs a little joy in their life," said Louise Isa, of Lor Tush. And they're very proud to explain this isn't just any toilet paper, It's bamboo, hypo-allergenic and three-ply extra soft.They've had their current supply manufactured overseas since last year.The business name, they said came naturally: "'Lor' is with a Baltimore accent how people say "little,'" said April Isa.With the help of donations, the goal now is to give out 500 to 1,000 more rolls."If we could just show them that things eventually do get better by people doing little things, just to show that they care, it really matters," said April Isa. Donations will help out with continued delivery costs, click here for information on where to donate.              BALTIMORE

Couples are livestreaming their weddings, creating a sense of 'certainty' at an uncertain time
.W
"We wanted to provide them with something that included love and optimism."

The coronavirus is not on the guest list, but the wedding crasher has arrived -- and engaged couples across the globe are now rethinking their walks down the aisle.When Atlanta couple Elsie Brotherton and Bree Beal got married over the weekend, their 140 guests gathered to watch their wedding ceremony despite the threat of the coronavirus. But their guests weren't clapping or cheering as they might normally do. Instead they were reacting with their thumbs-up, hearts and smiley face emojis.The couple chose to exchange vows in a neighbor's backyard on Facebook's livestream. More than 700 people tuned in to the ceremony."It feels great to be a newlywed right now. In fact, it has created a sense of certainty for us in a time when there is otherwise great uncertainty in the world," Brotherton told CNN.The venue, decorations and wedding dress were ready to go. They planned to host a dinner at their favorite local restaurant for the reception. But with governments trying to contain the spread of the virus by shutting down restaurants, ordering lockdowns and enforcing stay-at-home orders, they opted for alternative plans."We ended up ordering food from the restaurant where we had originally planned to eat. Not only is it delicious, but we wanted to support a local business struggling during the COVID-19 shutdown," the couple said.A small business owner herself, with four yoga studios in Atlanta, 34-year-old Brotherton has been forced to transition her business online."It has been an extremely stressful few weeks for me, and it was just such a blessing to be able to pause for a few hours on my wedding night and to connect with all of our friends around the world online. It felt like I could breathe for the first time since things started getting crazy," she said.The couple asked all their "guests" watching online to take a selfie of themselves toasting with the hashtag #loveinthetimeofcoronavirus. They received more than 100 selfies.The show must go onThe big question on the minds of engaged couples is whether or not to go through with wedding plans in the coming weeks and months. Nearly a third of the world's population, 2.5 billion people, is under some sort of movement restriction related to the coronavirus. With more than 500,000 cases around the world and more than 101,000 in the United States alone, large gatherings have been disrupted in major ways.For couples who decide the show must go on, they are adhering to safe social distancing and using online streaming platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Zoom to share their special day.Canadian couple Celena Peters and Josh Whiteman had family and friends traveling from across Canada to attend their Alberta wedding. With some guests at high risk for COVID-19, the couple's pastor mentioned livestreaming as an option so guests could still join them.Nearly 40 guests joined the couple's livestream wedding on Zoom. Some even dressed up just to watch it from home. Others were in sweatpants eating snacks.As brides and grooms search for workarounds, they are spending their days asking for refunds and begging for credits."It is relieving that it is over and we no longer have to worry about the constant updates and how it was affecting our planned wedding. That was the worst part -- not knowing what was going to happen," Whiteman told CNN.Many couples are leaning on friends and family more than ever. Sarah Marchese and Varun Khedekar of Sarasota, Florida, said their friend surprised them with the idea to livestream their reception last weekend. More than 40 of their guests joined the Zoom meeting."She created a Spotify music playlist for us to play at the virtual reception," the couple said. "We had no idea that so many of our friends and family were going to log on to Zoom and virtually celebrate with us. The best part was seeing that some of our guests still dressed up in suits and dresses, despite being at home. It was a wonderful surprise!"Megan Murphy, the friend who hosted the livestream, said it was the "best night in isolation.""People on the call would chime in with messages of congratulations and love, both via voice and in the chat feature, and we'd all hoot and holler whenever they kissed on camera," she recalled.Drew Piers, a guest at a friend's livestream wedding on YouTube in Tallahassee, Florida, said he had a "gasp" when the bride walked down the aisle for the first time.At the end of the ceremony, Piers' wife made light of the situation, participating in the wedding with her and reporting to bridesmaid duty."She grabbed a small potted plant we had in the house and walked through our house to the music, since she wasn't able to trail the bride and groom in person. We sent that video to them afterward to share some more laughs," Piers said.For some couples, it's an "agonizing decision." Trish Barillas and Charlie Sandlan spent more than a year and half planning their Guatemalan wedding. As the outbreak escalated, the couple worried about friends and family members traveling from the United States."We originally had 67 Americans who were flying down for the wedding and 120 Guatemalans who were attending. The week before the wedding we lost 42 American guests, including the maid of honor, as our friends were forced into painful decisions regarding what was best for themselves and their families," the couple said.The couple decided to livestream the wedding in Guatemala on Instagram for those who weren't able to attend."We wanted to provide them with something that included love and optimism. So even though we never saw our car, the ceremony venue or the reception, we were surrounded by tremendous love and support," the couple told CNN.Houses of worship are dealing with calls to close or limit the number of people allowed to enter their congregations.Danica Vella and Ian Attard from Malta chose to livestream their church wedding on Facebook, just as the country imposed a partial lockdown."Weirdest part of it all... walking in on all those empty seats... and empty Church, albeit our parents and siblings being there... but knowing it's for a good reason to ensure the health of us all," the couple wrote.                        The coronavirus is not on the guest list, but the wedding crasher has arrived -- and engaged couples across the globe are now rethinking their walks down the aisle. When Atlanta couple Elsie Brotherton and Bree Beal got married over the weekend, their 140 guests gathered to watch their wedding ceremony despite the threat of the coronavirus. But their guests weren't clapping or cheering as they might normally do. Instead they were reacting with their thumbs-up, hearts and smiley face emojis.                              Advertisement                       The couple chose to exchange vows in a neighbor's backyard on Facebook's livestream. More than 700 people tuned in to the ceremony. "It feels great to be a newlywed right now. In fact, it has created a sense of certainty for us in a time when there is otherwise great uncertainty in the world," Brotherton told CNN. The venue, decorations and wedding dress were ready to go. They planned to host a dinner at their favorite local restaurant for the reception. But with governments trying to contain the spread of the virus by shutting down restaurants, ordering lockdowns and enforcing stay-at-home orders, they opted for alternative plans. "We ended up ordering food from the restaurant where we had originally planned to eat. Not only is it delicious, but we wanted to support a local business struggling during the COVID-19 shutdown," the couple said. A small business owner herself, with four yoga studios in Atlanta, 34-year-old Brotherton has been forced to transition her business online. "It has been an extremely stressful few weeks for me, and it was just such a blessing to be able to pause for a few hours on my wedding night and to connect with all of our friends around the world online. It felt like I could breathe for the first time since things started getting crazy," she said. The couple asked all their "guests" watching online to take a selfie of themselves toasting with the hashtag #loveinthetimeofcoronavirus. They received more than 100 selfies.                                                                                                       These quarantining couples don't know when they'll see each other again                          The show must go on The big question on the minds of engaged couples is whether or not to go through with wedding plans in the coming weeks and months. Nearly a third of the world's population, 2.5 billion people, is under some sort of movement restriction related to the coronavirus. With more than 500,000 cases around the world and more than 101,000 in the United States alone, large gatherings have been disrupted in major ways. For couples who decide the show must go on, they are adhering to safe social distancing and using online streaming platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Zoom to share their special day. Canadian couple Celena Peters and Josh Whiteman had family and friends traveling from across Canada to attend their Alberta wedding. With some guests at high risk for COVID-19, the couple's pastor mentioned livestreaming as an option so guests could still join them. Nearly 40 guests joined the couple's livestream wedding on Zoom. Some even dressed up just to watch it from home. Others were in sweatpants eating snacks. As brides and grooms search for workarounds, they are spending their days asking for refunds and begging for credits. "It is relieving that it is over and we no longer have to worry about the constant updates and how it was affecting our planned wedding. That was the worst part -- not knowing what was going to happen," Whiteman told CNN. Many couples are leaning on friends and family more than ever. Sarah Marchese and Varun Khedekar of Sarasota, Florida, said their friend surprised them with the idea to livestream their reception last weekend. More than 40 of their guests joined the Zoom meeting. "She created a Spotify music playlist for us to play at the virtual reception," the couple said. "We had no idea that so many of our friends and family were going to log on to Zoom and virtually celebrate with us. The best part was seeing that some of our guests still dressed up in suits and dresses, despite being at home. It was a wonderful surprise!" Megan Murphy, the friend who hosted the livestream, said it was the "best night in isolation." "People on the call would chime in with messages of congratulations and love, both via voice and in the chat feature, and we'd all hoot and holler whenever they kissed on camera," she recalled. Drew Piers, a guest at a friend's livestream wedding on YouTube in Tallahassee, Florida, said he had a "gasp" when the bride walked down the aisle for the first time. At the end of the ceremony, Piers' wife made light of the situation, participating in the wedding with her and reporting to bridesmaid duty. "She grabbed a small potted plant we had in the house and walked through our house to the music, since she wasn't able to trail the bride and groom in person. We sent that video to them afterward to share some more laughs," Piers said. For some couples, it's an "agonizing decision." Trish Barillas and Charlie Sandlan spent more than a year and half planning their Guatemalan wedding. As the outbreak escalated, the couple worried about friends and family members traveling from the United States. "We originally had 67 Americans who were flying down for the wedding and 120 Guatemalans who were attending. The week before the wedding we lost 42 American guests, including the maid of honor, as our friends were forced into painful decisions regarding what was best for themselves and their families," the couple said.

Danica Vella and Ian Attard from Malta chose to livestream their church wedding on Facebook, just as the country imposed a partial lockdown. "Weirdest part of it all... walking in on all those empty seats... and empty Church, albeit our parents and siblings being there... but knowing it's for a good reason to ensure the health of us all," the couple  wrote .

Postal Service forced to keep working despite shortages of cash and protection
.W
Just like hospitals, post offices are facing critical shortages of essential products to protect them from the coronavirus outbreak.

United States Postal Service workers, who are still delivering and sorting mail at distribution centers around the country even as millions of Americans telecommute, are worried that they may not have the protection — or even the funding — they will need to keep delivering mail for months longer.Just like hospitals, post offices are facing critical shortages of essential products to protect them from the coronavirus outbreak — one union for U.S. Postal Service workers said this week it has heard thousands of concerns from its members related to coronavirus.Reports have popped up across the country where postal workers say they don't have hand sanitizer, gloves or masks, and are being told to work despite illnesses and are looking to community donations to address supply shortfalls.Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who oversees the U.S. Postal Service in his role as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's government operations subcommittee, said he has heard directly from the mail carriers that they are not getting the protection they need while on the job. "I had a conference call two or three days ago. I heard loud and clear concerns they had for their exposure. They cannot telework. They have to deliver the mail and sort the mail. They have to put the mail in mailboxes either at the post office or at people's homes and businesses," Connolly said. "They are complaining that in the workplace itself they are given no protective gear to help minimize the risk that has them very concerned."Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said postal workers in her region have said they don't have hand sanitizer or materials needed to keep post offices disinfected.But it's not just the current work conditions putting postal workers — and the mail millions depend on — at risk.For years, USPS has struggled to stay afloat with the emergence of technology threatening their bottom line, but coronavirus has further strained their financial situation as mail volume has declined. The Postal Service has warned that it could be insolvent by June, the House Oversight Committee said this week.Democrats working behind the scenes tried to inject $25 billion into the U.S. Postal Service in the stimulus bill, a quick infusion of cash intended to keep the post office operating even as business slowed. Democrats had also pushed for a debt forgiveness program, but neither item made it into the bill. Instead, the final bill included $10 billion in loans that have to be approved by the Treasury Department.The Postal Service said in a statement that the funding in the legislation was appreciated, but warned that the measure was insufficient because the lost revenue due to a "rapid drop in mail volumes" during the coronavirus pandemic is putting the future of the Postal Service at risk."The Postal Service remains concerned that this measure will be insufficient to enable the Postal Service to withstand the significant downturn in our business that could directly result from the pandemic," said USPS spokesman David Partenheimer. "Under a worst case scenario, such downturn could result in the Postal Service having insufficient liquidity to continue operations."The National Association of Letter Carriers, a union for USPS delivery workers, said in a statement that the legislation was "woefully inadequate."Connolly blasted his Republican colleagues for the lack of funding given the billions infused to other industries — including the airlines."What would happen tomorrow in the wake of this pandemic if the Postal Service announced tomorrow that they were going out of businesses and they were laying off all their workers?" Connolly said.The Postal Service has 630,000 employees across the country, making it one of the largest U.S. government agencies. USPS said Friday that 111 of its employees have tested positive for coronavirus, and one letter carrier died in New York.As millions shelter in place to wait out the coronavirus, the mail is a lifeline to distribute critical medicine and supplies to those who are homebound. It also will play a major role in helping distribute millions of checks to individuals and businesses who receive cash from the federal government as part of its historic stimulus program.In a statement pushing for more funding, the House Oversight Committee argued that the system helped to deliver more than a billion prescription drug orders last year. In rural areas, the committee said the Postal Service may be one of the only ways that individuals can get the items they need.The committee also warned that more than a quarter of all U.S. votes in recent elections were distributed through the mail, meaning a loss in funding could result in a disenfranchisement in voting for Americans."All that did was lift the cap a little bit on their current loan credit line, but it comes with conditionality," Connolly said. "They don't need more credit. They need debt forgiveness and an injection of liquidity to keep operating."The fight over the Postal Service is likely to continue, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled House Democrats were already turning to the next legislation even before President Donald Trump signed the $2 trillion bill on Friday afternoon.But for postal workers, the more immediate concern is safety as coronavirus spreads across the country.The NALC wrote in a letter to its members that it had fielded nearly 3,000 reports of issues across the country related to coronavirus, though it noted that USPS was receiving orders of hand sanitizers this week being distributed into the field."In the places where there are not enough supplies, or none at all, it is generally due to the overall shortage of these items throughout the country," wrote NALC President Fredric Rolando. "USPS has been working to acquire more items, even authorizing local managers to purchase them if they could be found."The American Postal Workers Union said it was concerned about the "distribution of personal protective equipment and sanitizers has been uneven across the country."Partenheimer said the USPS was working urgently to acquire and ship additional supplies, and that it was "making gloves and surgical masks available to all employees that request them.""We are actively encouraging any employee who feels they are sick to stay home," the USPS spokesman said.Some of the supply issues for the Postal Service can be attributed to the broader supply crunch that has hospitals scrambling for supplies and Federal Emergency Management Agency working to fill orders.Noble, a Boston-based distributor that contracts with the federal government, has 1,000 orders for back-logged for N95 masks for the Postal Service, the type most recommended to protect against the virus.CEO Tom Noble said the company can't fill the orders because FEMA is buying face masks directly from 3M — rather than relying on its usual distributors, putting FEMA at the front of the line and ahead of orders like Noble's.The backlog "bumps everybody to the right," Noble said. "That's not a normal chain of events for the market itself."

The FDA and FTC report a spike in products making false claims

Federal officials issued a warning about fake products that claim to prevent COVID-19 or cure it, on the heels of warnings about email and text message scams offering coronavirus tests. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission have seen a spike in products making false claims. However, there is currently no cure, treatment or vaccine. But investigators say companies are trying to profit from the coronavirus outbreak, including seven such companies the FDA says it caught doing so. The FDA has sent cease and desist letters to Vivify Holistic Clinic, Xephyr, Herbal Amy and Jim Bakker, the televangelist. Watch the video above to learn more about these companies, as well as a warning about fake coronavirus tests being texted and emailed to people. If you have any questions about drugs or treatments, talk to your doctor or contact the FDA at druginfo@fda.hhs.gov, or by phone 1-855-543-DRUG (3784).

CDC issues travel advisory for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut
.W
The CDC said this advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory urging people in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to "refrain from non-essential domestic travel" for the next two weeks.President Donald Trump had asked the CDC on Saturday to issue the advisory after he had floated the idea of a quarantine earlier in the day.The CDC said this advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply. These employees of critical infrastructure, as defined by the United States Department of Homeland Security and have a special responsibility to maintain normal work schedules.Related video above: Trump raises idea of quarantines for northeast USThe move comes, he said on Twitter, after consulting with the governors of the three states, who will administer the plan "in consultation with the Federal Government." The CDC said that the governors of the states would have "full discretion" on how to implement the advisory.Trump said in his tweet that a quarantine would "not be necessary."Trump had said earlier in the day that he was considering a short-term quarantine of "hot spots" in parts of the tri-state area — New York, New Jersey and Connecticut — where cases of coronavirus continue to rise."We're thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it's a hotspot. ... We might not have to do it, but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut," he told reporters as he departed the White House for Norfolk Naval Station to send off a Navy hospital ship to New York.Trump's suggestion comes after the United States this week became the epicenter of the global pandemic, with more than 120,000 reported Covid-19 cases across the country, and more than 52,000 of them in New York state alone. Officials forecast that the apex of the pandemic there is still 14 to 21 days away. But overwhelmed hospitals, in New York as well as across the U.S., working to treat coronavirus patients and curb the spread of the virus are facing a shortage of supplies and ventilators, a key piece of equipment. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that he spoke with Trump on Saturday morning, but that the two had not discussed a quarantine."I don't even know what that means. I don't know how that could be legally enforceable," the Democratic governor said during in a news conference in Albany. "And from a medical point view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing.""But I can tell you, I don't even like the sound of it," he added.Later Saturday, Cuomo told CNN that the quarantine sounded more like a lockdown for the New York area, calling a potential move by the federal government "mayhem.""It would be chaos and mayhem," Cuomo said. "It's totally opposite everything he's been saying. I don't think it is plausible. I don't think it is legal."Trump, however, earlier said that possible quarantine would be "enforceable" and "restrict travel" from those parts of the tri-state area. He also said any quarantine wouldn't affect truckers from outside the New York area."Restrict travel, because they're having problems down in Florida, a lot of New Yorkers going down. We don't want that," he said.Florida's governor had mandated a 14-day self-quarantine or isolation period for travelers coming to Florida from airports in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. According to media reports, wealthy New Yorkers have fled Manhattan for vacation homes in the Hamptons, the Catskills, the Poconos, Florida and Connecticut.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a call with Trump, the president mentioned the possibility of a quarantine "around the New York City area.""There's a lot of logistics involved and I think the president is well suited to figure that out," DeSantis said during a Saturday briefing. "Whatever works I think we need to do."DeSantis said it's not fair to Floridians "to just be airdropping in people from the hot zones, bringing infections with them." He added that New York officials were working hard and doing a great job but people are "dispersing from there." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, responded to Trump's tweet with one of his own, saying that the possible quarantine measures are "unclear" and could cause "confusion."The specifics & impact of this new directive by tweet are unclear & uncertain. The effect may be more confusion than confidence. Gov. Lamont has been strong & effective in his leadership instructing CT's people to self-quarantine & stay at home if possible," Blumenthal said in a Saturday Twitter post.As he departed from Joint Base Andrews, Trump said he would speak to Cuomo later about the possible quarantine. And describing the quarantine as something that would be "for a short period of time, if we do it at all," the president also said that he would not close the New York City subway.Earlier this month, Cuomo had deployed the National Guard and created a 1-mile "containment zone" in New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, in an attempt to stop a growing cluster of coronavirus cases.The National Guard helped coordinate delivering meals to those in quarantine and a drive-thru coronavirus testing site was opened.Cuomo said that the number of new coronavirus cases slowed over the period the restrictions were imposed.As of Saturday morning, New York had at least 728 reported deaths due to coronavirus and at least 52,318 reported cases — making it the state with the most in the nation, according to CNN Health's tally.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have returned to the United States after going into self-quarantine in Australia.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have returned to the United States after going into self-quarantine in Australia."We're home now, and like the rest of America, we carry on sheltering place and social distancing," Hanks tweeted Saturday. The couple tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month while in Australia, where Hanks had been doing pre-production work on a film about singer Elvis Presley. Hanks is set to play Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, in the film. Production on the project has been suspended."Many, many thanks to everyone in Australia who looked after us. Their care and guidance made possible our return to the USA. And many thanks to all of you who reached out with well wishes. Rita and I so appreciate it," the actor wrote.The couple had shared their experience in isolation, offered advice to those sheltering in place and even Wilson rapped to the 1992 hip hop hit "Hip Hop Hooray" by the rap group Naughty by Nature.

Since the heartbreaking photo was taken, the Arkansas family's home was destroyed by a tornado. The doctor was at home and "survived by the grace of God."

Hospital workers are separating from their families as a way to protect other family members during the coronavirus pandemic.An Arkansas physician has only seen his 1-year-old son Zeke through a glass door for the last two weeks. During that time, Dr. Jared Burks saw his son crawl for the first time."He is working right now in a rotation that has him all around the hospital, including the ER, and he just felt like it would be responsible for us to quarantine from each other," Alyssa Burks told KATV.She posted a photo of her husband and son on Facebook with their two hands separated by glass, which garnered many comments and shares."I've had a lot of people that have commented and said, 'Thank you for the sacrifice your husband is making and all of the other medical staff that are working alongside him,'" Burks told the TV station.On Saturday, a tornado struck their home and destroyed it, according to reports. Jared Burks was inside but "survived by the grace of God," Alyssa Burks posted on Facebook late Saturday. Watch the video above to learn more about this story.             JONESBORO, Ark.

Relief package billions can't buy hospitals out of shortages
.W
The problem isn’t a lack of money, experts say. It’s that there’s not enough of those supplies available to buy.

The billions of tax dollars headed for hospitals and states as part of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus response bill won't fix the problem facing doctors and nurses: a critical shortage of protective gowns, gloves and masks.The problem isn’t a lack of money, experts say. It’s that there’s not enough of those supplies available to buy. What’s more, the crisis has revealed a fragmented procurement system now descending into chaos just as demand soars, The Associated Press has found.Hospitals, state governments and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are left bidding against each other and driving up prices.Related video above: Trump signs $2.2 trillion stimulus packageFor more than a week, governors have pushed back against administration assurances that supplies are available now, bitterly complaining to President Donald Trump that there's no coordination.“It’s pretty much every state for itself,” said Virginia's secretary of finance, Aubrey Layne, who is deeply involved with his state’s effort to buy medical supplies. Masks that were priced at $2.50 a week ago are now being quoted as high as $9, he said, and suppliers make clear that there are “plenty of people out here” looking to buy, even at the high prices.“There is a lot of opportunism going on,” Layne said. Even if someone took some of this money and built the equipment to make masks, gowns and gloves, it would not solve the problem because none of the materials are made in the United States. That includes latex and rubber, largely from Southeast Asia, as well as textiles used in surgical gowns that can repel fluids but are easily disposable.“The suppliers that provide the raw materials needed to make such items have to increase their capacity in order to deliver more materials to manufacturers, which could take time and may not be feasible if the suppliers are located in other parts of the world that are currently crippled by the coronavirus,” said Kaitlin Wowak, an assistant professor at University of Notre Dame business school who specializes in analytics and operations. “The coronavirus is spreading at an unbelievable rate so you can only expect the demand for personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to follow the same trajectory, which is scary given that there is already a massive shortage of such items at hospitals,” said Wowak. Doctors and nurses in hot spots such as New York and New Orleans  are caring for feverish, wheezing COVID-19 patients without adequate masks, gloves or gowns.Can the $100 billion carved out for hospitals in the stimulus package solve that?“It is not about throwing money at this problem,” said Lisa Ellram, a professor of supply chain management at Miami University of Ohio. Just like consumers who today wander past empty shelves in the toilet paper aisle, state governments and hospitals are finding their suppliers’ warehouses are bare. The AP reported last week that imports of critical medical supplies were plummeting due to factory closures in China, where manufacturers had been required to sell all or part of their goods internally rather than export to other countries.Now that bottleneck has tightened as the pandemic sweeps through the world, shuttering potential backup factories from one country to the next. Many manufacturers have been ordered to shut down or limit production throughout Southeast Asia and Latin America, including in India and Mexico. In Malaysia, where 75 percent of the world’s medical gloves are made, AP found factories were shut down and only allowed to reopen with half staff, who are now locked in hostels at their workplaces.Shipments of medical gloves are down 23% so far this month compared with 2019, and medical gown imports are down 64% for the same period, according to trade data compiled by Panjiva and ImportGenius, services that track imports and exports. No medical-grade N95 masks, made almost entirely in China, have arrived at U.S. ports so far this month.An Oregon Nurses Association member who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for her job said she’s allowed one N95 mask a day to protect against tiny particulates. “Wearing the same mask from patient to patient to patient, what are you doing? Are we taking care of them or putting them at greater risk?” she said. A colleague has already tested positive for COVID-19, she said. Her own test was lost so she’s being retested. But she continues to work treating patients even though she has minor symptoms. Doctors and nurses working in hospitals have also told AP about shortages of saline flushes to clean intravenous catheters, disposable CaviWipe towelettes to clean hospital surfaces, defibrillator electrodes to shock hearts back into beating and oxygen concentrators, which help respiratory patients breathe. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.Six weeks ago, the Center for Global Development warned that the U.S. should get ready to rapidly scale-up medical supply manufacturing. Minnesota’s 3M Co. was already ramping up, but only in the past week have many others followed.A frenzied push to increase domestic production is too little and too late, said Prashant Yadav, a visiting fellow at the center.Trump on Friday announced that he was using his power under the Defense Production Act to order General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators — work that had already been underway, AP reported.Yadav said that in addition to more supplies, states and hospitals need a better way to allocate medical supplies to the places they’re needed most.“The real challenge is not having a clear dashboard-like function that can help match demand and supply. Just infusing more cash doesn’t create that,” he said Friday.Before the crisis, hospitals typically bought masks, gloves and other equipment through independent purchasers that bargain with suppliers to keep costs down. But those groups haven’t been able to fill orders.Soumi Saha, director of advocacy at Premier, which purchases equipment for roughly 4,000 hospitals, said 56% of hospitals didn't receive their orders for N95 masks in February. She said traditional wholesale markets are depleted and hospitals are turning to the gray market, rife with scams and counterfeit products. In a 72-hour period last week, Premier fielded more than 130 requests from hospitals to evaluate unregulated suppliers, none of which were legitimate, Saha said.“The short-term solutions are patchwork. We need to start implementing longer term solutions now or I don't know how much longer the Band Aid can hold on,” she said.The new nonprofit Project N95, launched by tech entrepreneurs, former government officials and supply chain experts, is one of many new impromptu clearinghouses for medical equipment trying to solve the crisis.Its website says it has requests from more than 2,000 institutions needing more than 100 million items of personal protection equipment in the next 30 days. The $100 billion earmarked for hospitals in the stimulus package will help quickly repurpose operating rooms into intensive care units, subsidize hospitals losing revenue due to canceled procedures, and hire additional staff to replace infected workers, said Ashley Thompson, the American Hospital Association’s senior vice president for policy.Hospitals will also receive an additional 20 percent Medicare reimbursement for COVID-19 patients, whose providers can use up to two weeks of personal protection equipment in a single day.Leaders of both parties promise the money will give doctors and nurses the resources they need.Lawmakers are "proud to have secured truly historic investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in hospitals, health systems, state and local governments, ensuring that they have the tools they need to combat the virus,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Friday. But even some in Congress are dubious.“If the administration has a list of critical supplies it is providing, what’s on that list?" said Rep, Norma Torres, D-Calif. "If they’ve conducted a nationwide needs assessment, what did they find? If they’ve met with industry to encourage new manufacturing, who did they meet with?”                         The billions of tax dollars headed for hospitals and states as part of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus response bill won't fix the problem facing doctors and nurses: a critical shortage of protective gowns, gloves and masks.

What's essential? In France: pastry, wine. In US: golf, guns
.W
What, really, is essential? It's a question countries across the world are asking, and their answers are telling.

The coronavirus pandemic is defining for the globe what's “essential” and what things we really can't do without, even though we might not need them for survival. Attempting to slow the spread of the virus, authorities in many places are determining what shops and services can remain open. They're also restricting citizens from leaving their homes. Stay-at-home orders or guidance are affecting more than one-fifth of the world's population.This has left many contemplating an existential question: What, really, is essential? Whether it is in Asia, Europe, Africa or the United States, there's general agreement: Health care workers, law enforcement, utility workers, food production and communications are generally exempt from lockdowns.But some lists of exempted activities reflect a national identity, or the efforts of lobbyists.In some U.S. states, golf, guns and ganja have been ruled essential, raising eyebrows and — in the case of guns — a good deal of ire. Related video above: Virus concerns strain grocery store operationsIn many places, booze is also on the list of essentials. Britain at first kept liquor stores off its list of businesses allowed to remain open, but after reports of supermarkets running out of beer, wine and spirits, the government quickly added them."Recent events clearly demonstrate that the process of designating 'essential services' is as much about culture as any legal-political reality about what is necessary to keep society functioning," said Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University.Countries including India and U.S. states are listing the information technology sector as essential. The world's dependency on the internet has become even more apparent as countless people confined to their homes communicate, stream movies and play games online to stave off cabin fever.Several states where marijuana is legal, such as California and Washington, deemed pot shops and workers in the market's supply chain essential. For some, the emphasis is on medicinal uses, not enabling cooped-up people to get stoned.“Cannabis is a safe and effective treatment that millions of Americans rely on to maintain productive daily lives while suffering from diseases and ailments,” Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in an email. “It is the very definition of essential that these individuals can still access their medicine at this time.”Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont added gun shops to his list of essential businesses, generating shock and dismay among families of gun violence victims. His spokesman Max Reiss said Lamont is trying not to overly disrupt commerce or interfere with legal rights. Newtown Action Alliance, a group formed after a gunman killed 26 people in 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, urged Lamont to reconsider, noting a recent surge in gun and ammunition purchases. The group predicted an "increased number of deaths due to unintentional shootings, homicides and suicides.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion Friday saying emergency orders in his state can't restrict gun sales. "If you have a break down in society, well then our first line to defend ourselves is ourselves, so I think having a weapon ... is very important for your personal safety,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a radio interviewer. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday quietly allowed gun shops to reopen, but only by appointment during limited hours if customers and employees comply with social distancing and other protective measures.There is a lot of variation across the United States because a national stay-at-home order has not been issued, said Benjamin Clark, associate professor of planning, public policy and management at the University of Oregon. “We end up with places making up the rules that are culturally or geographically specific,” Clark said. “This is why we see so much variation, and potential risk.”In Europe, the current epicenter of the pandemic, Italy has the most stringent rules, with only essential businesses such as food shops and pharmacies remaining open. The manufacturing sector was ordered shut down on Thursday, though factories that make needed products like medical supplies will continue to operate after making conditions safer for employees.Britain, which was initially reluctant to shut down business, has issued orders to close nonessential operations. Restaurants and eateries must be shut, but Britons can still get fish and chips and other meals, as long as they’re carry-out. In France, shops specializing in pastry, wine and cheese have been declared essential businesses.In a nod to Israel’s vibrant religious life, people can gather for outdoor prayers — with a maximum of 10 worshipers standing 2 meters (2 yards) apart. Demonstrations — also allowed — have occurred outside parliament and the Supreme Court, with participants maintaining social distance.“In times of uncertainty, institutions and practices that are central to the cultural identities can become really important touchstones — material markers of certainty, comfort, and mechanisms to persist,” said Aimee Huff, marketing professor at Oregon State University, specializing in consumer culture. In China, authorities closed most businesses and public facilities beginning in late January but kept open hospitals, supermarkets and pharmacies. Truck drivers delivering food, disinfectant and medical supplies to locked-down cities were hailed as heroes. Now, the ruling Communist Party is relaxing restrictions to revive the economy after declaring victory over the outbreak. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing conditions, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.In the United States, lobbyists have been trying to influence what gets on lists of essential services, so their clients' businesses can remain open. “They were absolutely earning their pay” in Connecticut, said Reiss, the governor's spokesman. He noted lobbyists for manufacturers and the golf course industry were particularly active.Despite their efforts, golf wasn't deemed essential in Connecticut. But Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey included golf courses on his list. Officials in Phoenix encouraged the city's 1.7 million residents to “get outside, get exercise and practice responsible social distancing” in golf courses, parks and trails.Mayors of five other Arizona cities pushed back, telling Ducey that including golf courses and payday lenders was taking the definition of essential too far.In California, construction executives and others lobbied state officials to get construction exempted from the stay-at-home mandate, the Sacramento Bee reported. State health officials responded by including all construction as essential. If construction in America's most populous state stalls — as it it did during the Great Recession — it would be difficult to restart, said Erika Bjork of the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which advocated for the industry. “We need to keep this engine humming, so when we come out of this we have housing,” Bjork said.Like Britain, some U.S. states allowed liquor stores to remain open, including New Mexico, which routinely ranks first in alcohol-related deaths per capita.State health officials were concerned that shutting them down would result in people with alcoholism seeking emergency medical attention, taking resources away from the coronavirus, said Tripp Stelnicki, a spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu said flower shops are among the essentials.Asked why, spokesman Ben Vihstadt said they provide essential services for funeral homes.___Associated Press reporters Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; Joe McDonald in Beijing; Carlo Piovano and Jill Lawless in London; Angela Charlton in Paris; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Josh Hoffner in Phoenix; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Michael Casey in Concord, New Hampshire contributed to this report.___Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky                        The coronavirus pandemic is defining for the globe what's “essential” and what things we really can't do without, even though we might not need them for survival.

The group predicted an "increased number of deaths due to unintentional shootings, homicides and suicides.”  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion Friday saying emergency orders in his state can't restrict gun sales.  "If you have a break down in society, well then our first line to defend ourselves is ourselves, so I think having a weapon ... is very important for your personal safety,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a radio interviewer.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday quietly allowed gun shops to reopen, but only by appointment during limited hours if customers and employees comply with social distancing and other protective measures. There is a lot of variation across the United States because a national stay-at-home order has not been issued, said Benjamin Clark, associate professor of planning, public policy and management at the University of Oregon.  “We end up with places making up the rules that are culturally or geographically specific,” Clark said. “This is why we see so much variation, and potential risk.” In Europe, the current epicenter of the pandemic, Italy has the most stringent rules, with only essential businesses such as food shops and pharmacies remaining open. The manufacturing sector was ordered shut down on Thursday, though factories that make needed products like medical supplies will continue to operate after making conditions safer for employees. Britain, which was initially reluctant to shut down business, has issued orders to close nonessential operations. Restaurants and eateries must be shut, but Britons can still get fish and chips and other meals, as long as they’re carry-out.  In France, shops specializing in pastry, wine and cheese have been declared essential businesses. In a nod to Israel’s vibrant religious life, people can gather for outdoor prayers — with a maximum of 10 worshipers standing 2 meters (2 yards) apart. Demonstrations — also allowed — have occurred outside parliament and the Supreme Court, with participants maintaining social distance. “In times of uncertainty, institutions and practices that are central to the cultural identities can become really important touchstones — material markers of certainty, comfort, and mechanisms to persist,” said Aimee Huff, marketing professor at Oregon State University, specializing in consumer culture.  In China, authorities closed most businesses and public facilities beginning in late January but kept open hospitals, supermarkets and pharmacies. Truck drivers delivering food, disinfectant and medical supplies to locked-down cities were hailed as heroes. Now, the ruling Communist Party is relaxing restrictions to revive the economy after declaring victory over the outbreak.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing conditions, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. In the United States, lobbyists have been trying to influence what gets on lists of essential services, so their clients' businesses can remain open.  “They were absolutely earning their pay” in Connecticut, said Reiss, the governor's spokesman. He noted lobbyists for manufacturers and the golf course industry were particularly active. Despite their efforts, golf wasn't deemed essential in Connecticut. But Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey included golf courses on his list. Officials in Phoenix encouraged the city's 1.7 million residents to “get outside, get exercise and practice responsible social distancing” in golf courses, parks and trails. Mayors of five other Arizona cities pushed back, telling Ducey that including golf courses and payday lenders was taking the definition of essential too far. In California, construction executives and others lobbied state officials to get construction exempted from the stay-at-home mandate, the Sacramento Bee reported. State health officials responded by including all construction as essential.  If construction in America's most populous state stalls — as it it did during the Great Recession — it would be difficult to restart, said Erika Bjork of the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which advocated for the industry.  “We need to keep this engine humming, so when we come out of this we have housing,” Bjork said. Like Britain, some U.S. states allowed liquor stores to remain open, including New Mexico, which routinely ranks first in alcohol-related deaths per capita. State health officials were concerned that shutting them down would result in people with alcoholism seeking emergency medical attention, taking resources away from the coronavirus, said Tripp Stelnicki, a spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.  In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu said flower shops are among the essentials. Asked why, spokesman Ben Vihstadt said they provide essential services for funeral homes. ___ Associated Press reporters Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut; Joe McDonald in Beijing; Carlo Piovano and Jill Lawless in London; Angela Charlton in Paris; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; Josh Hoffner in Phoenix; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Michael Casey in Concord, New Hampshire contributed to this report. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky

How to tell the difference between allergies, the flu and coronavirus
.W
Coronavirus anxiety has many people assuming the worst when they get a headache, stomach bug or raspy throat. But there's a way to tell the difference.

What before was just a simple headache, upset stomach or hot flash now can spell dread for hours, or even days, as you worry if you have "it." In the age of the novel coronavirus, once-minor inconveniences can be enough to cancel plans out of caution and social distancing. Mark Albert spoke with Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore health commissioner and Dr. Jesse Goodman, attending physician at Georgetown University to learn the difference and help understand what is nothing and what may be cause for concern.What are the symptoms? It seems like these are flu-like symptoms. Does everyone get a fever or can you have this without a fever?"The most common symptoms of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, are fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and less likely sneezing, runny nose that distinguishes it from allergies, from a cold," Wen said. "Some patients also have what are called atypical symptoms. They may feel achy all over, likely because of high fever. They may have abdominal symptoms, have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea as well. But these are all fairly nonspecific symptoms, such that a person who has another type of virus may well have these symptoms, too. There are also people who have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all and could still have COVID-19.""It's more than just the symptoms of a common cold or allergy," Goodman said. "You're sick. You have high fever and you're in one of these compromised host groups."Wen contended the only true way to know is to get tested, but the lack of testing kits available in the U.S. has impeded the goal of public health workers and led to dissatisfying results."This is why, though, testing is so important," she said. "It has been a major point of frustration that we haven't had enough testing here in the U.S. because it's a point of frustration for clinicians, for patients. I mean, it's frustrating to be told 'You could have COVID-19; we just can't test you; so go home and self-isolate.' That may be the right thing to do if we have no test, but it is frustrating. It also really hampers public health efforts, because if we do not know the true spread of COVID-19 in our communities, it also significantly limits our ability to figure out what interventions should be done."

The number of people who have died of novel coronavirus in Italy has risen by 969 in the past day, the biggest daily jump since the crisis began.

The number of people who have died of novel coronavirus in Italy has risen by 969 in the past day, the biggest daily jump since the crisis began.The total number of deaths now stands at 9,134, according to Italy's Civil Protection Agency, more than any other country.There has been an increase of 4,401 coronavirus cases in the past day, Italy's Civil Protection Agency said.The total number of recorded coronavirus cases in Italy, including deaths and those who recovered, now stands at 86,498.The 969 figure includes 50 deaths that were not included in Thursday's figures. The previous biggest spike in deaths came last Saturday, when there was an increase of 793.Since the beginning of the crisis in Italy, 51 doctors who tested positive for the disease have died, the Italian Association of Doctors said Friday. Of those doctors, 32 were working in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-hit by coronavirus.A total of 6,414 health care workers have been infected as of Thursday, according to the Italian National Institute of Health.Meanwhile, a 101-year-old man was released from a hospital after recovering from the coronavirus, Gloria Lisi, the deputy mayor of the Italian city of Rimini, has said.The man, who has been named only as "Mr. P," was admitted to hospital in Rimini, northeast Italy, last week after testing positive for COVID-19 and left the hospital Thursday.Lisi said his "truly extraordinary" recovery gave "hope for the future.""Mr. P made it. The family brought him home yesterday evening. To teach us that even at 101 years, the future is not written," she said.Mr. P was born in 1919, during the Spanish flu pandemic, which is estimated to have killed between 30 million and 50 million people worldwide.Rimini had registered 1,189 cases of coronavirus as of Thursday, according to the Italian Civil Protection Department.Authorities in 197 countries and territories have reported more than 575,000 novel coronavirus cases worldwide since China reported its first cases in December.

Trump adds 30 days to distancing guidelines as virus spreads
.W
President Donald Trump is extending the voluntary national shutdown for a month as the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus pandemic rise in the U.S.

President Donald Trump is extending the voluntary national shutdown for a month as sickness and death from the coronavirus pandemic rise in the U.S.The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday, and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines, at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic. But instead he decided to extend them through April 30, a tacit acknowledgment he'd been too optimistic. Many states and local governments have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.Trump's impulse to restore normalcy met a sober reality check Sunday from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, who said the U.S. could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. Trump's decision to extend the guidelines reflected a recognition that the struggle will take place over the longer haul.“I want our life back again,” the president told reporters in the Rose Garden.Brought forward by Trump at the outdoor briefing, Fauci said his projection of a potential 100,000 to 200,000 deaths is “entirely conceivable" if not enough is done to mitigate the crisis. He said that helped shape the extension of the guidelines, “a wise and prudent decision.”The federal guidelines recommend against large group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home. People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, nonessential travel and shopping trips.The extension would leave the federal recommendations in place beyond Easter on April 12, by which time Trump had hoped the country and its economy could start to rev up again. Alarmed public health officials said Easter was sure to be too soon.The U.S. had more than 137,000 COVID-19 cases reported by late Sunday afternoon, with more than 2,400 deaths. Earlier Fauci told CNN, “I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 cases,” then corrected himself to say he meant deaths. “We're going to have millions of cases.” But he added, “I don't want to be held to that” because the pandemic is “such a moving target.” One in 3 Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus, with schools and businesses closed and public life upended.Dr. Deborah Birx, head of the White House coronavirus task force, said parts of the country with few cases so far must prepare for what's to come. “No state, no metro area, will be spared,” she said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.Fauci's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu. Trump repeatedly cited the flu's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing down the severity of this pandemic.Trump had eyed a “reopening” of the U.S. economy by Easter, April 12, but in recent days, medical professionals have warned that would be far too soon for the nation's heavily affected urban areas.Just on Saturday, Trump was discussing tightening restrictions, suggesting and then backing away from an “enforceable” quarantine of hard-hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Instead, the White House task force recommended a travel advisory for residents of those states to limit nonessential travel to slow the spread of the virus to other parts of the U.S.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Trump shouldn't be so quick to reverse the social distancing guidelines, saying more testing needs to be in place to determine whether areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.Trump's “denial” in the crisis was “deadly,” she told CNN.“As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution," she said. She promised a congressional investigation once the pandemic is over to determine whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts and to answer the questions that resonates through U.S. political scandals: “What did he know and when did he know it?”Trump minimized the gravity of the pandemic for weeks. Asked whether she was saying that attitude cost American lives, Pelosi said: “Yes, I am. I'm saying that."It put Pelosi out of lockstep with former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, who said he wouldn't go so far as to lay the blame for deaths on the president. “I think that's a little too harsh," he told NBC.Biden faulted Trump for holding back on using his full powers under the recently invoked Defense Production Act to spur the manufacture of the full range of needed medical supplies — and for making erratic statements about the pandemic.“He should stop thinking out loud and start thinking deeply," Biden said.Meanwhile, governors in other hot spots across the country were raising the alarm that the spread of the virus was threatening their health care systems.“We remain on a trajectory, really, to overwhelm our capacity to deliver health care,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week.” “By the end of the first week in April, we think the first real issue is going to be ventilators. And we think it's about the fourth or fifth of April before, down in the New Orleans area, we're unable to put people on ventilators who need them. And then several days later, we will be out of beds.”He said officials have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors but so far have only been able to get 192.

Tokyo's infection spike after Olympic delay sparks questions
.W
Before the Olympics were postponed, Japan looked like it had coronavirus infections contained, even as they spread in neighboring countries.

Before the Olympics were postponed, Japan looked like it had coronavirus infections contained, even as they spread in neighboring countries. Now that the games have been pushed to next year, Tokyo’s cases are spiking, and the city's governor is requesting that people stay home, even hinting at a possible lockdown.The sudden rise in the number of virus cases in Tokyo, and the government's strong actions immediately after the Olympic postponement have raised questions in parliament and among citizens about whether Japan understated the extent of the outbreak and delayed enforcement of social distancing measures while clinging to hopes that the games would start on July 24 as scheduled.With the Olympics now off, many are voicing suspicion that the numbers are rising because Japan suddenly has no reason to hide them.“In order to make an impression that the city was taking control of the coronavirus, Tokyo avoided making strict requests and made the number of patients look smaller," former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said in a tweet. “The coronavirus has spread while they waited. (For Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike) it was Olympics first, not Tokyo's residents.”Experts have found a rise of untraceable cases mushrooming in Tokyo, Osaka and other urban areas — signs of an explosive increase in infections.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Saturday that Japan is now on the brink of a huge jump in cases as it becomes increasingly difficult to trace and keep clusters under control.“Once infections overshoot, our strategy ... will instantly fall apart,” Abe warned. “Under the current situation, we are just barely holding up.” He said a state of emergency is not needed just yet, but that Japan could at any time face a situation as bad as in the United States or Europe.There was less of a sense of urgency displayed recently when many people visited parks for cherry blossom viewing, and Abe was only hinting at an Olympic postponement. But in a phone call with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach last Tuesday, Abe agreed to postpone the games until around the summer of 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.A day later, Koike asked Tokyo residents to stay home weekends until mid-April, saying confirmed cases of the coronavirus had shot up to 41 in a day from 16 earlier in the week. On Saturday, Tokyo reported 63 new cases, another single-day record. Koike said infections in Tokyo were on the brink of an explosive increase, and that stronger measures, including a lockdown, could be needed if the spread of the virus doesn't slow.”Is this just a coincidence?" Maiko Tajima, an opposition lawmaker from the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said during a parliamentary session last Wednesday, citing Tokyo's sudden spike.Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said there is “absolutely no relationship” between the Olympic postponement and the number of confirmed cases. Abe cited experts as saying a big reason for the recent rise is the growing number of cases that can't be linked and a jump in infections from abroad. The prime minister told people to “be prepared for a long battle.”A day after Koike's warning, Abe convened a new task force under a recently enacted special law that would allow him to declare a state of emergency in specific areas, including Tokyo.Japan's strategy has been to focus on clusters and trace infection routes rather than testing everyone. A guideline issued Saturday still says that tests will be conducted per clinical doctors' advice. Experts set a high bar for testing eligibility, allowing them only for those linked to clusters or those with symptoms, because they fear massive testing will fill up beds that are needed for patients in severe need, and cause a collapse of medical systems.From Feb. 18 to March 27, Japan tested about 50,000 people, a daily average of 1,270 — fewer than the national daily capacity of several thousand. There was only a slight increase in the number of tests in the past week. In Tokyo, fewer than 2% of those who sought advice on a government hotline had been tested, according to health ministry figures. South Korea, by contrast, had tested about 250,000 people by mid-March.Abe denied allegations that Japan had manipulated the numbers by limiting tests, or combined COVID-19 deaths with other pneumonia fatalities. “I'm aware that some people suspect Japan is hiding the numbers, but I believe that's not true,” he said. “If there is a cover-up, it will show up in the number of deaths.” He said doctors told him that pneumonia patients with COVID-19 can be detected by CAT-scan or X-rays.Many Japanese experts say testing is not for everyone and should be conducted selectively in an attempt to save hospital beds for those who really need them. “Tests are primarily for people who are suspected of having the virus, and should be based on clinical judgment by doctors,” said Shigeru Omi, a former World Health Organization public health expert who is on the government-commissioned panel.Aki-Hiro Sato, a professor of information sciences at Yokohama City University, said in a recent report that Japan is now likely facing a second or third wave of the virus coming from Europe and the United States. Tokyo has about 430 cases, but Sato estimated an additional 1,000 might have been infected in Tokyo by late March if infections are accelerating at a pace similar to what's happening in other countries. Including asymptomatic or light infections, about 10,000 people might be infected, he said.As of Sunday, Japan had 2,578 confirmed cases, including 712 from a cruise ship, with 64 deaths, according to the health ministry. About 1,000 have recovered.Under the current law, COVID-19 is designated as an infectious disease and whoever tests positive is routinely hospitalized, but a new government guideline would allow a triage of patients, which would include self-quarantine at home.Right now, Japan has 2,600 hospital beds designated for infectious disease treatment, including 118 in Tokyo, but about one-third of them are already occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to Satoshi Kutsuna of the Disease Control and Prevention Center. Citing the recent spike, Kutsuna said an “overshooting of infections is just about to begin, unfortunately.”Abe has said the government would secure 12,000 beds and 3,000 ventilators to prepare for a worst case scenario.“We fear a situation where severe patients start dying when the medical system collapses, and we must prevent that situation,” Kato, the health minister, said Sunday on a talk show on public broadcaster NHK.                        Before the Olympics were postponed, Japan looked like it had coronavirus infections contained, even as they spread in neighboring countries. Now that the games have been pushed to next year, Tokyo’s cases are spiking, and the city's governor is requesting that people stay home, even hinting at a possible lockdown. The sudden rise in the number of virus cases in Tokyo, and the government's strong actions immediately after the Olympic postponement have raised questions in parliament and among citizens about whether Japan understated the extent of the outbreak and delayed enforcement of social distancing measures while clinging to hopes that the games would start on July 24 as scheduled.                              Advertisement                       With the Olympics now off, many are voicing suspicion that the numbers are rising because Japan suddenly has no reason to hide them. “In order to make an impression that the city was taking control of the coronavirus, Tokyo avoided making strict requests and made the number of patients look smaller," former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said in a tweet. “The coronavirus has spread while they waited. (For Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike) it was Olympics first, not Tokyo's residents.” Experts have found a rise of untraceable cases mushrooming in Tokyo, Osaka and other urban areas — signs of an explosive increase in infections. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Saturday that Japan is now on the brink of a huge jump in cases as it becomes increasingly difficult to trace and keep clusters under control. “Once infections overshoot, our strategy ... will instantly fall apart,” Abe warned. “Under the current situation, we are just barely holding up.” He said a state of emergency is not needed just yet, but that Japan could at any time face a situation as bad as in the United States or Europe. There was less of a sense of urgency displayed recently when many people visited parks for cherry blossom viewing, and Abe was only hinting at an Olympic postponement. But in a phone call with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach last Tuesday, Abe agreed to postpone the games until around the summer of 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                            2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics will be postponed due to coronavirus                          A day later, Koike asked Tokyo residents to stay home weekends until mid-April, saying confirmed cases of the coronavirus had shot up to 41 in a day from 16 earlier in the week. On Saturday, Tokyo reported 63 new cases, another single-day record. Koike said infections in Tokyo were on the brink of an explosive increase, and that stronger measures, including a lockdown, could be needed if the spread of the virus doesn't slow. ”Is this just a coincidence?" Maiko Tajima, an opposition lawmaker from the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said during a parliamentary session last Wednesday, citing Tokyo's sudden spike. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said there is “absolutely no relationship” between the Olympic postponement and the number of confirmed cases. Abe cited experts as saying a big reason for the recent rise is the growing number of cases that can't be linked and a jump in infections from abroad. The prime minister told people to “be prepared for a long battle.” A day after Koike's warning, Abe convened a new task force under a recently enacted special law that would allow him to declare a state of emergency in specific areas, including Tokyo. Japan's strategy has been to focus on clusters and trace infection routes rather than testing everyone. A guideline issued Saturday still says that tests will be conducted per clinical doctors' advice. Experts set a high bar for testing eligibility, allowing them only for those linked to clusters or those with symptoms, because they fear massive testing will fill up beds that are needed for patients in severe need, and cause a collapse of medical systems. From Feb. 18 to March 27, Japan tested about 50,000 people, a daily average of 1,270 — fewer than the national daily capacity of several thousand. There was only a slight increase in the number of tests in the past week. In Tokyo, fewer than 2% of those who sought advice on a government hotline had been tested, according to health ministry figures. South Korea, by contrast, had tested about 250,000 people by mid-March. Abe denied allegations that Japan had manipulated the numbers by limiting tests, or combined COVID-19 deaths with other pneumonia fatalities. “I'm aware that some people suspect Japan is hiding the numbers, but I believe that's not true,” he said. “If there is a cover-up, it will show up in the number of deaths.” He said doctors told him that pneumonia patients with COVID-19 can be detected by CAT-scan or X-rays. Many Japanese experts say testing is not for everyone and should be conducted selectively in an attempt to save hospital beds for those who really need them. “Tests are primarily for people who are suspected of having the virus, and should be based on clinical judgment by doctors,” said Shigeru Omi, a former World Health Organization public health expert who is on the government-commissioned panel.                                                                                                       Athletes come to terms with 'heartbreaking' Tokyo Olympics postponement                          Aki-Hiro Sato, a professor of information sciences at Yokohama City University, said in a recent report that Japan is now likely facing a second or third wave of the virus coming from Europe and the United States. Tokyo has about 430 cases, but Sato estimated an additional 1,000 might have been infected in Tokyo by late March if infections are accelerating at a pace similar to what's happening in other countries. Including asymptomatic or light infections, about 10,000 people might be infected, he said. As of Sunday, Japan had 2,578 confirmed cases, including 712 from a cruise ship, with 64 deaths, according to the health ministry. About 1,000 have recovered. Under the current law, COVID-19 is designated as an infectious disease and whoever tests positive is routinely hospitalized, but a new government guideline would allow a triage of patients, which would include self-quarantine at home. Right now, Japan has 2,600 hospital beds designated for infectious disease treatment, including 118 in Tokyo, but about one-third of them are already occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to Satoshi Kutsuna of the Disease Control and Prevention Center.

A man who was among dozens of nursing home residents in Carroll County who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the state's first outbreak has died.

A man who was among dozens of nursing home residents in Carroll County who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the state's first outbreak has died.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||State and county health officials said there's an outbreak of coronavirus at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where 66 residents have tested positive, with 11 hospitalized at Carroll Hospital Center and Frederick Memorial Hospital.One of the residents, a man in his 90s, died Saturday evening. Carroll County Health Officer Ed Singer said the man had underlying health conditions.Singer said the facility is a comprehensive care facility with 104 beds."We're trying to isolate folks who are at the property. There are quite a few people who are sick," Singer said Sunday afternoon. Singer said there are no patients going in or out of the facility as of Sunday.County health officials said Pleasant View Mount Airy had previously implemented multiple prevention measures according to state and federal guidance, including restricting visitation and communal dining, suspending group activities, implementing extra cleaning measures and conducting daily checks for both staff and residents for symptoms."The facility was doing everything it was supposed to be doing up front," Singer said.Carroll County Board of Commissioners President Stephen Wantz said officials are doing everything they can to ensure everyone is protected the most way that they can."This has been something that's really taxing our resources in Carroll. We never thought we would be in a position like this with an incident of this magnitude," Wantz said.Hospital officials stress that people should follow social-distancing guidelines and stay home as they provide care."We have been providing staff support, supplies, anything necessary to help them provide the care," Carroll Hospital Center President Leslie Simmons said. "Our goal absolutely without a doubt is to stop the spread of the virus.""You have got to make sure that you are doing your social distancing," Wantz said. "I'm not sure what people are not understanding about this deadly pandemic."Simmons said people who have underlying health conditions should call their health care provider, but others should stay home."If you have no symptoms, you do not need to be tested. If you have mild symptoms, you should stay home and monitor your symptoms. You do not need to be tested," Simmons said.Mount Airy Mayor Pat Rockinberg said the municipality is following emergency operations plans. Police said they are ensuring the safety of the facility and ensuring the public is not interfering."We will enforce Gov. Hogan's executive order. We're asking everybody to calm down and realize this is a private property and anybody trespassing will be arrested," Maryland State Police Westminster Barrack commander Lt. Rebecca Bosley said.The Carroll County Health Department is able to answer general questions about coronavirus at 410-876-4848.Gov. Larry Hogan issued the following update to Marylanders:"It took nearly three weeks for the national capital region to go from 0 to 1,000 cases of COVID-19. It took three days for the region to go from 1,000 to 2,000 cases in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. This is a rapidly evolving and escalating emergency which is now surrounding the nation's capital."The number of deaths in our state as a result of COVID-19 has doubled. We have lost 10 of our fellow Marylanders, and we mourn each and every one of them."Tonight, Maryland has experienced a tragic coronavirus outbreak at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy. Multiple state agencies are on the scene and working closely with the local health department and the facility as they take urgent steps to protect additional residents and staff who may have been exposed."I want to thank all of the doctors, nurses, and first responders all across our state who are working around the clock to respond to this pandemic."As we have been warning for weeks, older Marylanders and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable and at a significantly higher risk of contracting this disease."We continue to call for Marylanders to stay at home, except for essential reasons, in order to help stop the spread of this virus."We are leveraging the full arsenal of public health and government, but defeating this invisible enemy will require a unity of effort and spirit like nothing we have ever faced."PHNjcmlwdCBpZD0iaW5mb2dyYW1fMF9kZWIyNWMzOC03OGU3LTQyOTgtODIxYS1kYzlmOWJlM2Y4ZWEiIHRpdGxlPSJNYXJ5bGFuZCBjb3JvbmF2aXJ1cyBjYXNlcyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL2UuaW5mb2dyYW0uY29tL2pzL2Rpc3QvZW1iZWQuanM/MmdnIiB0eXBlPSJ0ZXh0L2phdmFzY3JpcHQiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pg==             MOUNT AIRY, Md.

"God works in mysterious ways," a resident said.

A tornado ripped through Jonesboro, Arkansas, injuring 22 people and leaving a trail of flattened homes and buildings.Mayor Harold Perrin and other local officials said there were no deaths after the tornado touched down on Saturday in the city, about 130 miles northeast of Little Rock.Of the 22 injured people, two stayed in the hospital overnight but did not have life-threatening injuries, officials said.Some residents are convinced that many more people could've been injured if not for people staying at home to slow the spread of coronavirus.Joel Campbell works as a car salesman near Turtle Creek Mall, where severe storms upturned cars and caused extensive damage.The mall has been closed because of coronavirus."God works in mysterious ways," Campbell said."I never would have thought in a million years we would get hit with this tornado during COVID-19," he said. "I don't think anyone thought that. But the fact that we were going through this COVID-19, is a good thing."Images posted on social media, including from the Jonesboro Police Department, showed broken walls, flattened commercial buildings and debris scattered across parking lots.One picture showed a mangled vehicle in the mall parking lot. At the local airport, at least one airplane was overturned and hangars were damaged.The search and rescue efforts were completed by Sunday morning, and responders are moving into the cleanup and recovery phases, Craighead County Judge Marvin Day said.The storm moved across Jonesboro around 5 p.m. local time Saturday, according to a video posted by the National Weather Service in Little Rock.Day said there is a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., and Jonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliott urged residents to stay home while debris is cleared out of roadways and other common areas."We've already asked you to stay at home for this virus but we're really stressing to stay at home," Elliott said.Meanwhile Dr. Jared Burks, who has self quarantined from his wife and young son amid the coronavirus outbreak, are among people who lost their homes on Saturday.A photo of Burks and his 1-year-old son, Zeke, touching hands through a glass door, garnered national social media attention.Watch the video above to learn more about this story.

Plans to add a grocery store and other new retail, expanded office space and 318 luxury apartments to the Village of Cross Keys were unveiled to a group of Roland Park leaders Wednesday night.The north Baltimore development is ripe for redevelopment, said Arsh Mirmiran, a partner in Towson-based Caves Valley Partners that will buy the north Baltimore property from a subsidiary of New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp., VCK Realty LLC.The fate of the Village of Cross Keys is similar to Harborplace, also owned by Ashkenazy. The downtown waterfront landmark is in receivership and has been hit with a high vacancy rate and disrepair since Ashkenazy acquired it in 2013 from General Growth Properties. The developer acquired the Village of Cross Keys at the same time.The sale of Cross Keys is expected to close by spring and designs for the redevelopment will commence in full after that, Mirmiran told the Roland Park Civic League at its monthly meeting where about 60 people were in attendance.Read the full story in the Baltimore Business Journal             BALTIMORE

Inside a New York hospital that is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and deaths
.W
"Every day I come, what I see on a daily basis, is pain, despair, suffering and health care disparities," one doctor said.

At Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in New York, the intensive care unit is at capacity, patient beds line the hallways of the emergency department, and the morgue is overflowing.COVID-19, Dr. Arabia Mollette said, has turned the Brooklyn-based hospital into "a war zone.""A medical war zone," Mollette, an emergency room physician at Brookdale Hospital, told CNN. "Every day I come, what I see on a daily basis, is pain, despair, suffering and health care disparities."This is the reality for many hospitals across New York, which has become the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak. Brookdale Hospital granted CNN rare access on Sunday to view health care workers' fight against COVID-19. The hospital is located in Brownsville, one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City. The Brooklyn borough is one of the hardest hit by the virus, according to city data.Hospital staffers said they want people to understand how dire the situation is for health care workers, and how the hospital needs more federal resources and help from the public in order to continue combating the coronavirus."The hope that we have is that if people be more socially responsible and stay home and do what they can do to flatten this curve, it will help alleviate the pressure off the emergency department," Mollette said.Overflow of patients, not enough resourcesBrookdale Hospital, which began seeing COVID-19 patients at the beginning of March, said it now has more than 100 patients who have tested positive for the virus, and 78 additional patients are hospitalized as they await results. As of Sunday, at least 20 patients had died after contracting the virus.The hospital sees over 100,000 patients annually, and has a capacity of about 300 people at any given time, Khari Edwards, the hospital's vice president of external affairs, told CNN.But with coronavirus cases rapidly increasing, there has been an influx of patients.Already, the hospital has started to open up floors that have not been in use for years to make room for more patient beds, Mollette said. The hospital has also converted its pediatric emergency department into a COVID-19 isolation area, she added.To separate the space from other wings of the hospital, health care workers hung plastic sheets from the walls, and used duct tape to prevent them from falling."I can say that every corner every part of the hallway, every room, every space has been filled up to capacity with our patients," Mollette said.Inside the ER, a cacophony of coughing filled the room as one nurse walked through rows of filled beds to feed a patient juice.Meanwhile, the ICU is quieter — as the lulled beep of machines, including ventilators, reverberates."Wash your hands" signs hang on the doors of patients' rooms, reminding those who enter to do the task recommended most by health officials amid the pandemic.As is the case with many other hospitals across the country, Brookdale Hospital is struggling to keep up with the demand for resources as more patients come in."We need gowns, we need gloves we need masks we need more vents (ventilators)," Mollette said. "We need more medical space. We need psychological support as well. It's not easy coming here when you know what you're getting ready to face."President Donald Trump previously downplayed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's request for 30,000 more ventilators for the state."I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators," Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in an interview last week.But Dr. Amy Plasencia, chief medical resident at Brookdale Hospital, said the hospital has "a critical shortage of ventilators in relation to the numbers that we are seeing."Ventilators are used on serious cases of COVID-19 to help patients breathe who are struggling to do so on their own, Plasencia said.Once patients are hooked up to the machines, they generally need to continue using them for one to two weeks or longer, she said."Certainly no physician wants to be put in a position where they have to triage treatments based on resource availability," she said. "But in this national crisis that is where we may be heading."Brookdale Hospital, like others in the state, is so strapped for ventilators that it has started looking at ways to repurpose older models that have been out of use, and adapting anesthesia machines to use as ventilators, Plasencia said.The hospital's morgue is also overflowing.Edwards said the morgue can usually hold around 20 people, and the hospital's already "gone over that" number.The hospital now has a refrigerated truck provided by the state to help with the overflow of bodies."What's more so terrifying is you have family members who can't come pick up normally as they lose a family member," Edwards said. "Funeral homes are swamped."Health care workers have already begun preparing additional beds in anticipation of having even more patients in the coming weeks, Edwards said.Hospital workers stay away from their own families to protect themWearing protective gear is now considered essential at most hospitals to avoid spreading the coronavirus.At Brookdale Hospital on Sunday, almost all health care employees -- including janitorial staff, food workers, nurses and doctors -- made sure to protect themselves by covering up from head-to-toe while working in patient areas.The standard "uniform" for any health care employee as they brave the packed hospital includes gloves, face shields, surgical masks, gowns or lab coats, and covers for their hair and shoes.With the gear on, some say they feel safe — at least for now.Lab technician Andrei Legoun, who began his shift around 7:30 a.m., is among the hospital employees at the frontlines every day.Right now, he is focused on turning around dozens of COVID-19 tests at a time at the hospital.It can take anywhere from three to six hours to get back test results, Legoun said.The hospital said it is now offering a new, rapid test, which Legoun said can do as many as 300 tests in a day. Legoun said he hopes they will eventually be able to complete up to 500 tests a day.Legoun said he is not nervous about exposure to the virus -- the samples he gets are placed in a water bath to deactivate the virus before he tests them. Plus, he added, "I have a mask."Still, Legoun said he has spent the last two months away from his family, and has avoided seeing anyone face-to-face — even his daughter and girlfriend."In case I'm a carrier for some reason, I don't want to pass it along to them," he said.Mollette also hasn't seen her family in months, and sleeps in a separate bedroom from her fiancé to protect him."I'm going to be honest with you: I don't really sleep that well at night," Mollette said. "I'm worried about my family, I worry about my safety. I'm worry about my colleagues. I worry about how the shift is going to be the next time I come. I worry about if a family member is going to come and be patient as well."For Plasencia, protecting fellow hospital employees — particularly residents and interns — is of equal importance, as they collectively continue to work on the frontlines of the crisis."We are trying to sustain morale," she said. "And certainly in this outbreak we are providing emotional support for each other, but it's a very difficult time for health care."                        At Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in New York, the intensive care unit is at capacity, patient beds line the hallways of the emergency department, and the morgue is overflowing.

"The hope that we have is that if people be more socially responsible and stay home and do what they can do to flatten this curve, it will help alleviate the pressure off the emergency department," Mollette said. Overflow of patients, not enough resources Brookdale Hospital, which began seeing COVID-19 patients at the beginning of March, said it now has more than 100 patients who have tested positive for the virus, and 78 additional patients are hospitalized as they await results. As of Sunday, at least 20 patients had died after contracting the virus. The hospital sees over 100,000 patients annually, and has a capacity of about 300 people at any given time, Khari Edwards, the hospital's vice president of external affairs, told CNN. But with coronavirus cases rapidly increasing, there has been an influx of patients.                                                                                                       These are the stories of some of the US victims of the coronavirus                          Already, the hospital has started to open up floors that have not been in use for years to make room for more patient beds, Mollette said. The hospital has also converted its pediatric emergency department into a COVID-19 isolation area, she added. To separate the space from other wings of the hospital, health care workers hung plastic sheets from the walls, and used duct tape to prevent them from falling. "I can say that every corner every part of the hallway, every room, every space has been filled up to capacity with our patients," Mollette said. Inside the ER, a cacophony of coughing filled the room as one nurse walked through rows of filled beds to feed a patient juice. Meanwhile, the ICU is quieter — as the lulled beep of machines, including ventilators, reverberates. "Wash your hands" signs hang on the doors of patients' rooms, reminding those who enter to do the task recommended most by health officials amid the pandemic. As is the case with many other hospitals across the country, Brookdale Hospital is struggling to keep up with the demand for resources as more patients come in. "We need gowns, we need gloves we need masks we need more vents (ventilators)," Mollette said. "We need more medical space. We need psychological support as well. It's not easy coming here when you know what you're getting ready to face." President Donald Trump previously downplayed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's request for 30,000 more ventilators for the state. "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators," Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in an interview last week.                     But Dr. Amy Plasencia, chief medical resident at Brookdale Hospital, said the hospital has "a critical shortage of ventilators in relation to the numbers that we are seeing." Ventilators are used on serious cases of COVID-19 to help patients breathe who are struggling to do so on their own, Plasencia said. Once patients are hooked up to the machines, they generally need to continue using them for one to two weeks or longer, she said. "Certainly no physician wants to be put in a position where they have to triage treatments based on resource availability," she said. "But in this national crisis that is where we may be heading." Brookdale Hospital, like others in the state, is so strapped for ventilators that it has started looking at ways to repurpose older models that have been out of use, and adapting anesthesia machines to use as ventilators, Plasencia said. The hospital's morgue is also overflowing. Edwards said the morgue can usually hold around 20 people, and the hospital's already "gone over that" number. The hospital now has a refrigerated truck provided by the state to help with the overflow of bodies. "What's more so terrifying is you have family members who can't come pick up normally as they lose a family member," Edwards said. "Funeral homes are swamped." Health care workers have already begun preparing additional beds in anticipation of having even more patients in the coming weeks, Edwards said. Hospital workers stay away from their own families to protect them Wearing protective gear is now considered essential at most hospitals to avoid spreading the coronavirus. At Brookdale Hospital on Sunday, almost all health care employees -- including janitorial staff, food workers, nurses and doctors -- made sure to protect themselves by covering up from head-to-toe while working in patient areas.                     The standard "uniform" for any health care employee as they brave the packed hospital includes gloves, face shields, surgical masks, gowns or lab coats, and covers for their hair and shoes. With the gear on, some say they feel safe — at least for now. Lab technician Andrei Legoun, who began his shift around 7:30 a.m., is among the hospital employees at the frontlines every day. Right now, he is focused on turning around dozens of COVID-19 tests at a time at the hospital. It can take anywhere from three to six hours to get back test results, Legoun said. The hospital said it is now offering a new, rapid test, which Legoun said can do as many as 300 tests in a day. Legoun said he hopes they will eventually be able to complete up to 500 tests a day. Legoun said he is not nervous about exposure to the virus -- the samples he gets are placed in a water bath to deactivate the virus before he tests them. Plus, he added, "I have a mask." Still, Legoun said he has spent the last two months away from his family, and has avoided seeing anyone face-to-face — even his daughter and girlfriend. "In case I'm a carrier for some reason, I don't want to pass it along to them," he said. Mollette also hasn't seen her family in months, and sleeps in a separate bedroom from her fiancé to protect him. "I'm going to be honest with you: I don't really sleep that well at night," Mollette said. "I'm worried about my family, I worry about my safety. I'm worry about my colleagues. I worry about how the shift is going to be the next time I come. I worry about if a family member is going to come and be patient as well." For Plasencia, protecting fellow hospital employees — particularly residents and interns — is of equal importance, as they collectively continue to work on the frontlines of the crisis. "We are trying to sustain morale," she said. "And certainly in this outbreak we are providing emotional support for each other, but it's a very difficult time for health care."

A grassy meadow in New York's Central Park normally occupied by sunbathers and picnickers is now an emergency field hospital.

A grassy meadow in New York's Central Park normally occupied by sunbathers and picnickers is now an emergency field hospital as officials scramble to support a hospital system getting overwhelmed by coronavirus.The 68-bed field hospital in the park's East Meadow along the Upper East Side is designed as a respiratory care unit.Samaritan's Purse, a Christian humanitarian aid organization, set up the tents in cooperation with FEMA, state officials and local hospital authorities, the organization said.Mayor Bill de Blasio said the tent hospital is expected to be operational by Tuesday.Though small, the field hospital is an example of how New York is using every possible method to expand its capacity to treat coronavirus patients.The Army Corps of Engineers transformed Manhattan's Javits Convention Center into a makeshift 1,000-bed field hospital, and Gov.

Maryland prison officials confirm coronavirus in detention system
.W
State prison officials confirmed Monday, for the first time, the presence of coronavirus inside the detention system.

State prison officials confirmed Monday, for the first time, the presence of coronavirus inside the detention system. It follows news of a confirmed outbreak inside the Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric hospital in Jessup.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Dealing with the spread of the virus is especially challenging in secure institutions and dangerous for the people housed in institutions, and employees who work in them.Prison officials confirmed the spread of coronavirus to the state's prison system: an inmate at the Jessup Correctional Institute, who's been hospitalized; and two contract employees, at least one of whom works in Baltimore.This follows Sunday's news of nine confirmed cases inside the Clifton T. Perkins secure psychiatric hospital, also in Jessup -- eight inmates have tested positive, one employee.The union that represents employees said there are too few protections.”They need more sanitizer. They need gloves, masks, they need to reduce movement in some of the locations,” said Patrick Moran, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. At a news briefing Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan acknowledged the danger employees face, but he said the lack of protective gear is a crisis within a crisis.“No, we do not have enough gear. No one in the country has enough gear. That's the number one problem in America that everyone is talking about,” said Hogan.The prison system is: Tracing contacts between infected people and others.Making sure deep cleaning is done.Space for quarantine has been set aside.Temperature checks are done on employees on each shift.Grab-n-go meals have replaced the dining hall.Moran said it is a frightening time for employees, but they will stay on the job.“Our members are incredibly dedicated to their jobs. Our members are committed to their jobs. Our members work these jobs even in the face of danger when you don't have a pandemic such as this,” he said. City leaders have called for the release of inmates -- such as older inmates, non-violent offenders during the coronavirus pandemic. So far, no inmates have been released.              BALTIMORE

Police: Man charged in connection with assault of woman with syringe
.W
Anne Arundel County police said they arrested a man in connection with the assault of a woman in Churchton.

An Anne Arundel County man accused of an attack with a syringe is being held without bail Wednesday.The victim and alleged attacker both live in Churchton. The victim, Katie Peters, told 11 News that she feels safe going out in public now that the suspect is in jail.Peters said she thought she was burned by a cigarette butt at a grocery store cart-return area last week in Churchton. She said she confronted a man there and that he said, "It felt like a bee sting didn't it?"According to Anne Arundel County police, Peters was the target of a random sneak attack with a loaded syringe stuck in her rear end, which was caught on surveillance camera.Police said they received an anonymous tip that led them to Thomas Bryon Stemen, 51, of Churchton, and the recovery of a syringe full of liquid from the driver's side door of his vehicle.On Wednesday, a judge ordered Stemen held without bail on first- and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment charges."So he's being held without bond. So it's over for everybody now, except for me and him. So he has to deal with the fallout of what he's done, and I have to deal with the fallout of 30 days of medicine for present preventative purposes," Peters said.Peters said she is terrified of the unknown."I am at a loss right now because I do not know what was in that needle," Peters said. "He will not tell the police. He will not tell the judge what was in that needle. Why? What was so bad that was in that needle? What's going to happen to me?"During the court proceedings Wednesday, the prosecutor told the judge Stemen tried to do the same thing to two other women but he had bad aim and missed. Peters is pleading with the two women to come forward."We need the two people that he attempted to get to come forward so that we can build a better case against him, so that he'll never come back out of jail," Peters said.Police said anyone with information is asked to call Anne Arundel County police at 410-222-1960.

Baltimore police have one suspect in custody Friday in connection with the shooting death of Carmen Rodriguez, who was killed just before Christmas inside her family's grocery store.

Baltimore police have one suspect in custody Friday in connection with the shooting death of Carmen Rodriguez, who was killed just before Christmas inside her family's grocery store.Police said Terrance Peterson, 29, turned himself in to the Eastern District Thursday following a public release of surveillance video. "The release of the video did help in that case," Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said. "Anything else we might say could turn into evidence. We can't speak to it at this time.""Mr. Peterson was aware of some of the media attention, and he turned himself in to the Eastern District yesterday. Homicide detectives brought him to headquarters, where he was charged," Baltimore police homicide unit Commander Maj. Steve Hohman said.Peterson was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Rodriguez and other charges for his involvement in the killing, officials said. He is being held at Central Booking.A $5,000 reward from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives remains in place for information leading to the arrest of the second suspect.Rodriguez, 36, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head on Dec. 22 inside her food business, Kim Deli & Grocery. People in the community said Rodriguez and her husband managed the store and were kind to everyone.Video released by police was taken both inside and outside the store. It shows a person of interest and the alleged shooter, as well as their getaway car.A vigil will be held for Rodriguez on Jan. 22 at 5:30 p.m. on the corner of Kenwood Avenue and Fayette Street."I'm disgusted by it. I'm glad something is moving forward justice-wise," said Terrell Wilson, a customer of the store. "I'm still in shock. That was my friend. (I) went to the store every day, got whatever I needed. She's not with her kids anymore. (It's) not just a store; she was our friend."Dewey Schultz, a neighbor, said Rodriguez was an excellent person. He hopes police catch everyone involved."It's sickening. It's disgusting. I didn't think my city was like this. It seems like it's not getting any better," Schultz said.In a statement, Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen told 11 News, "Our community stands behind the family of Carmen Rodriguez. To murder a mother in front of her children is unthinkable. We are hopeful that with the recent arrest of a suspect in her murder, justice will be served." Cohen also said the street will be renamed to honor Rodriguez's legacy.​             BALTIMORE

"This complete stranger, who owed me nothing and is more on the front lines than I am, shared his precious masks with me, without my even asking."

A Minnesota state trooper moved a doctor to tears when he turned what should have been a speeding ticket into a heartwarming act of kindness.Dr. Sarosh Ashraf Janjua, a cardiologist at a coronavirus quarantine unit in Duluth, was pulled over by Trooper Brian Schwartz for speeding on March 21.But instead of a ticket, Schwartz handed Janjua five N95 masks he was supposed to use as protection -- along with a firm warning for speeding."I burst into tears. And though it may just have been the cold wind, I think he teared up a little as well, before wishing me well and walking away," Janjua said on Facebook."This complete stranger, who owed me nothing and is more on the front lines than I am, shared his precious masks with me, without my even asking."Schwartz felt compelled to offer Janjua his N95 masks after noticing "what appeared to be two used N95 masks in Ashraf's purse that he assumed she was reusing," the Minnesota State Patrol said in a statement to CNN.The N95 respirator masks that health care workers need to protect themselves while treating coronavirus patients are in dangerously short supply. Physicians are being forced to wear used masks, risking infection when they care for patients.Like millions of health care workers across the world, Janjua, who is originally from Boston, said she was "afraid" of not having proper equipment to protect herself from possibly getting sick far from home."Thank you to Sarosh for her hard work and dedication," the Minnesota State Patrol said on Facebook. "Troopers are working hard during the pandemic and are thinking about all the first responders who are caring for Minnesotans during this critical time."While the coronavirus pandemic has changed the world as we know it, the kindness of people like Trooper Schwartz is a reminder that nothing can take away our unity in times of crisis."I think we are all just hanging on to something that makes us feel safe," Janjua told CNN. "Somehow, for Americans, that something has become N95 masks and toilet paper. Trooper Schwartz' act of kindness became my something."             DULUTH, Minn.

Pastor arrested for violating rules amid virus outbreak
.W
Florida officials have arrested the pastor of a megachurch after detectives say he held two Sunday services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Florida officials have arrested the pastor of a megachurch after detectives say he held two Sunday services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.According to jail records, Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne turned himself in to authorities Monday afternoon in Hernando County, where he lives. He was charged with unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order. Bail was set at $500, according to the jail's website, and he was released after posting bond.Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news conference Monday that he negotiated with the attorney of Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne to turn himself in to authorities in Hernando County. His church is located in Tampa.“Not only did the church comply with the administrative order regarding six-foot distancing, it went above and beyond any other business to ensure the health and safety of the people," said a statement from Liberty Counsel, Howard-Browne's law firm. "Contrary to Sheriff Chronister’s allegation that Pastor Howard-Browne was ‘reckless,” the actions of Hillsborough County and the Hernando County Sheriff are discriminatory against religion and church gatherings.”Howard-Browne isn't alone in refusing to curtail in-person worship services despite public health orders designed to stop the virus from spreading. Churches in Ohio, Kentucky and Louisiana have continued to invite worshippers in recent days as at least a half-dozen states offer some degree of exemption for faith in their orders to shutter nonessential activity during the pandemic.Chronister said his command staff met with The River at Tampa Bay Church leaders about the danger they are putting themselves — and their congregation — in by not maintaining appropriate social distancing, but Howard-Browne held the services. The Sheriff's Office also placed a digital sign on the road near the church driveway that said “practice social distancing.”“Shame on this pastor, their legal staff and the leaders of this staff for forcing us to do our job. That's not what we wanted to do during a declared state of emergency,” Chronister said. “We are hopeful that this will be a wakeup call."The church has said it sanitized the building, and the pastor said on Twitter that the church is an essential business. He also attacked the media for “religious bigotry and hate.” In the statement released late Monday afternoon, Liberty Counsel said the church enforced the six-foot distance rule between family groups, made sure the staff wore gloves, gave every person who entered hand sanitizer, among other things.The county and governor’s orders require gatherings, including those held by faith-based groups, be fewer than 10 people to limit the spread of COVID-19. A live stream of Sunday's three-and-a-half-hour church service showed scores of congregants. In a Facebook post, Howard-Browne said coronavirus “is blown totally way out of proportion.”On March 18, the church called its ministry an essential service, just like police and firefighters, and said it would keep its doors open.In a Facebook video Sunday, Howard-Browne said, “It looks like we're going to have to go to court over this because the church is encroached from every side.”“This is really about your voice. The voice of the body of Christ,” he said.As recently as last year, Howard-Browne's church hosted an event with Paula White-Cain, who was named an advisor leading President Donald Trump’s Faith and Opportunity Initiative. She's also an unofficial spiritual advisor to the president.             TAMPA, Fla.

'I am willing to give up my ventilator': Woman makes changes to living will amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
A retired nurse says she made changes to her living will in case medical professionals have to decide who gets life-saving equipment if more people become sick with COVID-19.

Darlene Freyer said she is worried that medical professionals may soon have to decide who gets ventilators if more people become sick with COVID-19."I am willing to give up my ventilator to someone who still has a life to live," the Pittsburgh-area woman said Monday.Freyer said she has underlying medical issues and she worries that if she becomes ill, she will be given a ventilator that someone else might need."I've lived my life. I'm 65 years old," she said. "I've raised a whole family. I spoke to them about this decision. They respect this decision."Freyer said she has informed her power of attorney and changed her living will to reflect her decision. "I don't want to take some college student's ventilator, I don't want to take some young mother with four children's ventilator, I don't want to take a 70-year-old person's ventilator who maybe has a disabled child that they're still caring for. Age doesn't always have to be a factor with this," she said.Freyer said she hopes her decision will save a life and help health care professionals make otherwise tough decisions.She said she retired from her career as a nurse six years ago."Common sense tells me our medical professionals are going to have to make some very hard decisions choosing who gets the ventilators and who does not," Freyer said. "Why not help our warriors that are on the front line do their job just a little bit easier?"              PITTSBURGH

Ford to build 50,000 ventilators in 100 days
.W
Other automakers have also vowed to help manufacture ventilators on a large scale.

Ford plans to make as many as 50,000 simple ventilators for coronavirus patients within 100 days and plans to continue producing 30,000 per month after that, the company announced Monday.The automaker said it will make the ventilators at its Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The factory will be staffed by 500 United Auto Workers union members who have volunteered to work on the project, Ford officials said.The ventilator is currently being made by Florida-based Airon Corp. and has been licensed by GE Healthcare. Ford has been working with GE Healthcare to help increase its ventilator output.The Airon Model A-E ventilator that Ford will produce operates on air pressure alone and requires no electricity. Airon currently makes three of the ventilators per day at its factory in Melbourne, Florida. Ford's plant will produce the ventilators around the clock with three shifts of workers, Ford said, and it will make 7,200 of the devices per week.Ford is also working with GE Healthcare to increase GE's own production of its more advanced ventilators. It's also working on designing a simplified GE Healthcare ventilator device that Ford could also produce.Other automakers have also vowed to help manufacture ventilators on a large scale. General Motors is partnering with another ventilator maker, Ventec Life Systems, to help increase Ventec's production. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he plans to manufacture ventilators at a Tesla plant in Buffalo, though the company has not shared details about that effort.A few other companies, including Dyson in the United Kingdom, are also designing new ventilators and pledging to help traditional medical supply manufacturers ramp up their production.On Monday, Virgin Orbit announced it was also seeking to produce ventilators, making it one of the first aerospace companies to get involved. The California-based rocket startup said it has been working with UCI Health, a California research hospital, and the University of Texas at Austin, to create a prototype for a so-called "bridge" ventilator — a  simple device that the company says can be quickly manufactured on a large scale.Bridge ventilators could be used to treat some of the less critically ill COVID-19 patients in order to free up more sophisticated ventilators for those in dire need, Virgin Orbit said.Kevin Zagorski, an engineer who typically works on rocket engine design, is heading up Virgin Orbit's ventilator manufacturing efforts. He said that if the bridge ventilator design gets FDA approval for its design in the coming days, Virgin Orbit could begin producing thousands of the ventilators a week at its Los Angeles factory.

Gender reveal sparked 10-acre brush fire, officials say
.W
Even with a burn ban in place, fire officials in Florida have already seen an increase in fires, including a blaze that was reportedly sparked by a gender reveal celebration.

Even with a burn ban in place, fire officials in Florida have already seen an increase in fires, including a Saturday blaze that was reportedly sparked by a gender reveal celebration. "We were informed that it was caused by a gender reveal using Tannerite and a weapon," said Brevard County Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer. “Something as seemingly innocent as a gender reveal, can turn into a large-scale disaster where homes are threatened."Schollmeyer said people need to follow the rules of burn bans, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, which is straining resources.   "Especially during all these potential COVID-19 responses and medical responses it can quickly overwhelm resources and by that I mean, it will leave no resources to respond to those medical calls when needed," Schollmeyer said. "We want to prevent those wildfires started carelessly by let's say fireworks, camp fires, open trash and burning, bonfires, those kind of incidents can escalate rapidly. The outdoor equipment utilizing internal combustion engines like ATVs, lawnmowers and the like, make sure they have a spark arrestor on them."             BREVARD COUNTY, Fla.

While many associates have been taking their temperature at home, Walmart says it will start to take their temperatures before each shift.

Walmart on Tuesday announced additional steps to be taken in stores to keep the public and workers safe in the COVID-19 pandemic.Temperature ChecksWalmart said associates will be asked basic health questions before their shift and have their temperatures taken. Anyone with a temperature of 100 degrees will be paid for reporting to work and asked to go back home. A news release states those employees would not be able to return to work until they were fever-free for at least 3 days.The news release says Walmart is working to send infrared thermometers to all locations. That process could take up to 3 weeks.Associates are encouraged to not show up to work if they feel any of the COVID-19 symptoms like coughing, feeling achy and difficulty breathing.  Masks and glovesWalmart's news release also says the company will make gloves and masks available to associates. This is as long as supplies last. Walmart said the masks will arrive in 1 to 2 weeks.According to Walmart's online statement, "They will be high-quality masks, but not N95 respirators — which should be reserved for at-risk healthcare workers." Associates who would like a mask and gloves are encouraged to ask their manager.             BENTONVILLE, Ark.

How to stay healthy when gyms are closed

Is it safe to go for a run? How do you get a full workout at home with no equipment? Here's how to stay healthy while practicing social distancing.

Gyms, yoga studios, spin classes. You name it, it's closed to blunt the curve of the novel coronavirus. But the home presents new challenges, mainly motivation. How can people stay fit and healthy with so many distractions in the home? Mark Albert spoke with Dr. Jesse Goodman, attending physician at Georgetown University; Dr. Leana Wen, former health commissioner of Baltimore; and Nick Kripowicz, a certified strength and conditioning specialist with VIDA Fitness, to better understand how people can stay healthy and active when we're advised to social distance.Is it okay if I just go out for a walk?"I think it's great for people to go for walks as long as you can do it in a way that you could keep at least several feet away from people," Goodman said. "So you don't want to do it in a crowded place. "You know, it is important to stay sane, stay physically active, all right? And remain healthy in these other ways, such as eating well and exercising."Wen repeated that sentiment, noting that social distancing doesn't have to mean being locked up inside."Make sure that we continue to exercise," Wen said. "I agree with my colleagues that we really we shouldn't just be staying indoors. We should ... stay away from people. But we could do that outdoors. We take hikes and walks."I've got the fitness gear. I'm cooped up at home. How do I start?"So the easiest way to start is to set yourself a short time," Kripowicz said. "Something like 15 or 20 minutes." Kripowicz recommends moving once every hour. He says no fancy equipment is needed. Just pick a short period of time for working out, and keep going if you can."One of my favorites is taking your trusty backpack and filling it with big, heavy books," Kripowicz said. "So you can use this for almost any exercise you could do with a free weight in the gym, like some kind of tricep extension, bicep curl. You can pretty much do anything with it if you're willing to get creative."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's coronavirus website encourages people to take care of their bodies by also eating healthy, well-balanced meals, exercising regularly and getting plenty of sleep.

Neurosurgeon who separated conjoined twins dies from complications of COVID-19
.W
Dr. James T. Goodrich also served as a Marine during the Vietnam War.

Dr. James T. Goodrich, the neurosurgeon who allowed CNN inside a remarkable operation to separate twins Jadon and Anias McDonald, died on Monday after complications related to COVID-19, according to the hospital where he worked."Dr. Goodrich was a beacon of our institution and he will be truly missed," said Montefiore Medicine CEO Dr. Philip O. Ozuah. "His expertise and ability were second only to his kind heart and manner."The hospital described Goodrich as a "humble and truly caring man" who "did not crave the limelight and was beloved by his colleagues and staff." They spoke of his skills as a neurosurgeon, but also of his spirit, including how he baked cookies during the holidays and hand-delivered them to nurses."Jim was in many ways the heart and soul of our department - a master surgeon, a world-class educator, and a beloved colleague for all," Dr. Emad Eskandar, chair of the department of neurosurgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center said. "His sudden loss is heart-breaking and his memory will always remain foremost in our thoughts."The hospital called Goodrich a pioneer in the field of helping children with complex neurological conditions; he developed a multi-stage approach for separating craniopagus twins, like Jadon and Anias McDonald, who were fused at the brain and skull.Goodrich was thrust into the spotlight in 2004 when he operated on Carl and Clarence Aguirre, twins from the Philippines who shared about 8 centimeters of brain tissue. In 2016, Goodrich led a team of 40 doctors in a 27-hour surgery at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx to separate Anias and Jadon, who were 13 months old when they were separated. CNN was in the operating room with Goodrich and the team as the boys were separated.It marked the seventh separation surgery performed by Goodrich — and just the 59th craniopagus separation surgery in the world since 1952.The doctor, with his tufts of gray hair and beard, was known for his incredible skill with his hands, but also his heart. He kept in touch often with patients he operated on. Families spoke about how he would never forget the children's birthdays, and always be there for those special milestones, ones he helped make possible.Separating conjoined twins is "actually pretty awesome," he told CNN before the McDonald brothers' operation. "It's chaotic ..."We've got it down to a fine art, but in the beginning, it was a bit of a challenge."Goodrich, who was in this 70s, spent more than 30 years at Montefiore Einstein and was the director of the Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Montefiore and a professor of clinical neurological surgery, pediatrics, plastic and reconstructive surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.Goodrich was originally from Oregon and served as a Marine during the Vietnam War, Montefiore Einstein said, and he was known for his passion for historical artifacts, travel and surfing.

Man charged with attempted murder in shooting of 2 Anne Arundel County police detectives
.W
Two Anne Arundel County police officers were shot late Wednesday night while pursuing a person of interest in a death investigation, police said.

A man has been charged with attempted murder in connection with the two Anne Arundel County police officers who were shot late Wednesday night.Police said Joseph Robert Mitchell Willis, 22, of Pasadena, is charged with the murder of Christopher Lawrence Jones, 44, of Glen Burnie, and the attempted murder of one of the two police detectives. The investigation is on-going and additional charges will be placed.County fire officials said a call was dispatched around 11:07 p.m. Wednesday and two officers were taken to Shock Trauma.Anne Arundel County police Sgt. Jacklyn Davis said detectives were investigating a death. Earlier in the evening, police said detectives were called to the 600 block of Newfield Road, where a man found inside a house with a gunshot wound."It's one guy (who) lives there. There are so many people that come and go in that house, it isn't funny," said Joe Cortina, a neighbor.Police realized that the victim's vehicle was missing. Around six hours later, the vehicle was found about 7 miles north in the Fort Smallwood area of Baltimore City."Detectives went to initiate a traffic stop on that suspect. That suspect fired on officers, striking a detective. He has been transported to an area hospital. He was able to break off the pursuit to get medical attention," Davis said. "A second detective continued the pursuit of the subject, who was shooting at him, chased him into the Stoney Beach community, they exchanged gunfire again and that detective was also shot. So we have two detectives shot. Our suspect is still outstanding in the Stoney Beach community."During the initial stages of the investigation, Davis said the man is tall, perhaps around 6 feet tall, skinny and white, and he possibly has face and/or neck tattoos.Davis said the first shooting occurred right across the Baltimore City line near a Royal Farms store.WBAL-TV 11 News reporter Tre Ward reported seeing a Royal Farms store off Fort Armistead and Fort Smallwood roads blocked off with crime scene tape. Baltimore City police told 11 News that detectives were sent to the 5400 block of Fort Smallwood Road for an investigation.The second shooting was in the Stoney Beach community. "Anybody in that community, look out your windows. If you see somebody in your yard give us a call. We consider him armed and dangerous. He shot two of our guys. He's armed, he's dangerous, and we're out looking for him," Davis said.The first officer shot is in critical, but stable, condition. He was taken to a hospital in life-threatening condition. The second officer shot is in stable condition and is recovering the same hospital."We're going to hope and pray with everything that we have that they're going to stay that way," Davis said.The detectives were identified as Detective Scott Ballard, a 22-year veteran assigned to the fugitive apprehension team, and Detective Ian Preece, a 13-year veteran assigned to the homeland security investigations team.As of Thursday evening, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said Detectives Ballard and Preece are out of surgery, taking first steps to recovery.Thursday morning, Police Chief Timothy Altomare urged the shooter to turn himself in to police."Every minute you stretch this out, it makes it more dangerous for my cops, and thus it makes it more dangerous for you. We need you to come and turn yourself in. We will treat you with respect to a human being. You will be safe and we will respect your rights. But you need to come in and end this lunacy before another person gets hurt." Gov. Larry Hogan released a statement, saying, "We have absolutely no tolerance for the violence committed against two Anne Arundel County Police detectives last night. These brave officers are now in stable condition, and all Marylanders are praying for their full and speedy recovery."Around 50 officers in the area went door-to-door to talk to residents.Around 9:30 a.m. Thursday, 11 News reporter Jennifer Franciotti said there was a large SWAT presence around Fort Smallwood Road. She said activity seemed to be concentrated in the upper floor of a laundromat. The scene has since cleared.Anne Arundel County Schools officials said the following schools in the northeast cluster were closed Thursday: Northeast High School, George Fox Middle School and High Point, Riviera Beach, Solley and Sunset elementary schools. The district announced that these schools would be open on time Friday.Refresh wbaltv.com and our app, and watch 11 News for late-breaking updates.             PASADENA, Md.

Cruise ships are still scrambling for safe harbor
.W
More than a dozen cruise ships remain stranded at sea right now — some with and some without passengers — as ports deny entry and passengers panic about returning home.

More than a dozen cruise ships remain stranded at sea right now — some with and some without passengers — as ports deny entry and passengers panic about returning home.On March 13, in light of mounting fears over onboard COVID-19 outbreaks, the Cruise Lines International Association made the decision to suspend operations from U.S. ports of call for 30 days.Two weeks later, thousands of passengers and crew members remain aboard at least 20 ships across the world.Industry group CLIA encompasses 38 cruise companies, with a total of 277 ships.The organization confirmed to CNN on Friday that about 5.4% of the total fleet was still at sea completing journeys.Major cruise lines P&O, Cunard, Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Holland America have extended their ban on cruising until mid-May.Here are details on the cruise ships still in limbo that we know about.Cruise ships with passengersZaandam — Holland AmericaStatus: Sailing to Fort Lauderdale, FloridaThe Zaandam was sailing a South American voyage that departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was originally supposed to conclude in San Antonio, Chile, on March 21.Influenza-like symptoms have been reported by 76 guests and 117 crew members. Eight passengers have tested positive for COVID-19.Four guests on board Zaandam have passed away, the cruise line confirmed Friday."I fear other lives are at risk," Orlando Ashford, president of Holland America Line, said in a statement. No one has exited the ship since it stopped in Punta Arenas, Chile, March 14. Guests were originally told they could disembark in Chile for flights, but ultimately this was forbidden.Once flu-like symptoms cropped up on board, those with symptoms were isolated and their traveling companions quarantined. All guests were asked to remain in their staterooms.The ship stopped in Valparaiso, Chile, to refuel, and now it's heading to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.All the ports en route are closed to cruise ships, so Holland America deployed another of its ships, Rotterdam, to offer relief.Rotterdam met Zaandam off Panama on the evening of March 26 to "provide extra supplies, staff, COVID-19 test kits and other support as needed."Previously, the ship had no coronavirus test kits on board.Holland America transferred healthy Zaandam guests to Rotterdam. The guests who moved from Zaandam to Rotterdam completed a health screening beforehand, says Holland America.Guests on both ships are remaining in their staterooms until the ship disembarks.  Zaandam is considering "alternative options" if the plan to disembark in Fort Lauderdale falls through, but the hope was the ship would dock there Monday. "We need confirmation from a port that is willing to extend the same compassion and grace that Panama did, and allow us to come in so our guests can go straight to the airport for flights home," said Ashford, who says the ship tried to disembark passengers earlier in the voyage. "It's tempting to speculate about the illnesses that may have been avoided or lives saved if we'd gotten the assistance we sought weeks ago."Arcadia — P&O Cruises UKStatus: Sailing to Southampton, EnglandCruise ship Arcadia embarked on a 100-day, round trip World Cruise back in January, in a very different cruising landscape.Now, the ship is making its way back to Southampton, in the United Kingdom. It's due to arrive on April 12 on schedule.The ship is skipping all stops after it was turned away from Cape Town."As South African authorities are enforcing additional entry and travel restrictions because of the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, all guests are remaining on board until Southampton, where Arcadia is due to arrive on Sunday 12 April as per the original itinerary," said P&O Cruises in a statement.There are no reported cases of COVID-19 on board.Coral Princess — Princess CruisesStatus: Sailing to Fort Lauderdale, FloridaThe Coral Princess departed Santiago, Chile, March 5. Princess Cruises announced operations were halting one week later.Princess Cruises tried to negotiate disembarkation in Brazil for guests on board the Coral Princess. Anvisa, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, denied the disembarkation of Coral Princess guests, including those with confirmed outbound flights.The ship is now traveling directly to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. There are no known cases of COVID-19 on board.Sara Roberts is one of 374 British passengers on board."We are all virus free and want the British government to send a safe repatriation flight to enable us to travel safely home together," she tells CNN Travel. "Ideally we would like this to happen en route in Barbados."  Princess Cruises said internet and guest stateroom telephone service is currently complimentary, to help guests stay in touch with family members.

3 VEIP locations converted to coronavirus-testing stations
.W
Various Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program centers around Maryland have been converted into drive-through testing facilities for the coronavirus.

Three Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program centers around Maryland have been converted into drive-through testing facilities for the coronavirus.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Gov. Larry Hogan announced on Monday free, appointment-only, drive-through testing for the coronavirus is now available at several vehicle emissions facilities around the state, including Waldorf, Bel Air and Glen Burnie."(We) have begun drive-through testing for COVID-19 at three motor vehicle emissions inspection stations," Hogan said.The VEIP location on Ordnance Road in Glen Burnie had a soft opening Monday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. All three locations officially open Wednesday, state health officials said.People pulled in to get checked in. Those who had approval from their doctor and an appointment then drove into the actual emissions garage for testing.Officials told 11 News everything ran smoothly Monday, and the biggest issue involved people actually showing up for their emissions testing.Patients must get a referral from their physician, and they need to make an appointment. (Link to make appointment will be made available here.)"When a patient goes to make an online appointment, they will see the time slots and locations that are available on that given day," Maryland Department of Health spokesman Andy Owen said.To qualify for testing at a VEIP site, individuals must:Meet testing criteria as determined by a licensed healthcare provider.Obtain an order for testing from a healthcare provider.Register online and make an appointment at a test site.Once individuals have a confirmed order from a healthcare provider, they will receive a unique code they can use to make an appointment at the closest available testing site, state health officials said. MDH will operate the site in Glen Burnie in conjunction with the Anne Arundel Health Department. MDH will operate the site in Waldorf in conjunction with the Charles County Health Department. Both of these sites will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, in partnership with the Harford County Health Department, will operate the VEIP site in Bel Air, which will be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Sabrina Lacayo was one of the first to be tested Monday. She said it was an easy process from when she spoke to her doctor."I had a cough, fever, sore throat, runny nose, I can't taste," Lacayo said. "We did a tele-visit. So, they talk to you on the phone, and they ask you your symptoms, and they send you a lab slip to come and get it done."And then she got her test."They stick a swab up your nose, and it's a little uncomfortable. That's pretty much it. They ask for your information. It's a little pressure up there, that's it," Lacayo said.Health officials said results will be given to patients through their physician in three to 10 days.There's also a screening site at FedEx Field in Landover, Prince George's County. Maryland Department of Health spokesman Andy Owen described the opening there as a soft opening, limited to only a few patients Monday.HOW TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR SCREENING AT FEDEX FIELDAll patients, including those with prescriptions from a doctor, must make an appointment through the Prince George's County Health Department's COVID-19 hotline at 301-883-6627.According to the Prince George's County Health Department, testing requires the following steps:Call the Prince George's County Health Department Coronavirus hotline at 301-883-6627 to schedule an initial telehealth screening.The telehealth medical professional will speak to the caller to obtain information to determine if the patient meets the CDC testing requirements.If the caller meets CDC testing guidelines, they will receive an appointment time and an appointment number (from 1 to 100 **MUST KEEP ASSIGNED APPOINTMENT NUMBER) to go to the FedExField site on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday. Patients must show up at their appointment time, with their appointment number, and be able to answer questions based on their telehealth screening.Upon arriving at the testing site, patients will receive instruction from law enforcement as to where to park and when to exit their vehicle.The individual will walk to the checkpoint and give their appointment number, then they will be escorted to a tent based on their symptoms.If a patient meets testing requirements outlined by the CDC, they will be escorted to the testing tent. Following the testing, the individual will be given instructions on home self-care, and social distancing.Those who do not meet CDC guidelines will not be tested. Those individuals who do not meet criteria but are symptomatic will receive instructions on home self-care and self-isolation, as needed. Those individuals who are asymptomatic will receive instructions on home self-care and social distancing. The individual will then be escorted to the exit.             GLEN BURNIE, Md.

Harry and Meghan officially start their non-royal life. Here's what that will look like
.W
Here's what we can expect to see from their transition.

When the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they would be giving up their senior royal roles to become "financially independent," it sent shock waves through the British establishment and became the topic of intense debate across the country and beyond.Why are they doing it? How will they survive? And what do the rest of the family think about it?So much has happened in the weeks since that such questions are no longer top of mind, as the couple said in a statement Monday ahead of their official transition to being non-working members of the royal family."The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to COVID-19," a Sussex spokesperson said. "However, we recognize there are outstanding questions relating to their future beyond their Household transition deadline."That future includes no longer using the name "Sussex Royal" for their nonprofit organization, website or Instagram account, as March 31 marks the end of their time as senior royals and the start of their new life. As the couple officially relinquishes their royal duties, here's what we can expect to see from their transition.They're still part of the royal family — but can't use royal titlesWe've seen the wider family put up a united front following what royal sources initially described as "disappointment" and "upset" at the Sussexes' original bombshell statement in January of this year.Queen Elizabeth drew the line on Harry retaining any royal appointments, most notably his cherished honorary military titles. The hybrid royal role he had initially carved out for himself clearly wasn't workable for anyone else, nor was the intention to continue using the brand in his marketing. As a result, Harry and Meghan will no longer use the titles His and Her Royal Highness, and will no longer represent the Queen.This doesn't change Harry's place in the line of succession, and it doesn't mean the couple will no longer move in royal circles. On March 9, as part of their final royal duties, the Sussexes joined everyone from the Queen to the Countess of Wessex at Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service.There was much written about the lack of interaction between the Sussexes and Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge. But the bigger message was that while Harry and Meghan may be leaving "the firm," they remain part of the family.They'll receive some support from Prince CharlesBehind the scenes, arrangements have been finalized on the terms of the couple's departure. The Prince of Wales agreed to continue to support them financially through his private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, though not as far as keeping their office going at Buckingham Palace. They were allowed to keep their home on the Windsor estate in England — if they repaid the £2.4 million (about $3 million) of public funds used to renovate — but the couple had made clear they intended to spend more time in North America anyway.Initially, that appeared to mean Canada, where they had taken a house on Vancouver Island. But President Donald Trump tweeted this week that the family had left for the U.S. and that "the U.S. will not pay for their security protection."A spokesperson for the Sussexes responded immediately with a statement saying they had no plans to ask the U.S. government for security resources and that privately funded security arrangements have been made.They're already getting to workThis leaves the Sussexes with sizeable outgoings that may not be covered by the support provided by Harry's father, even when combined with his mother's inheritance — certainly not to the style to which they have become accustomed.Harry has taken a couple of speaking opportunities with Wall Street banks where he discussed mental health issues. Meghan has done a voiceover for a Disney film about elephant protection in Botswana. The couple are closely associated with both these issues and can speak credibly to them, and they are also projects that could develop into lucrative income streams without appearing to compromise the royal brand.The challenge going forward will be continuing to find such deals, ones that pay enough but don't rock the boat back in the UK. Like the rest of us, the Sussexes now have bills to pay, but they have also vowed to stop trading on the brand that made them so commercially valuable in the first place: royalty.Now that their transition out of royalty is complete, prepare for their reinvention."The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months focusing on their family and continuing to do what they can, safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future nonprofit organization," the couple's team said in Monday's statement.

A look at the emotional toll coronavirus is taking on health care workers

There's so much appreciation for the health care providers whose tireless efforts are well-documented across the country and close to home.

There's so much appreciation for the health care providers whose tireless efforts are well-documented across the country and close to home. But something we may not have in our minds is what's going through theirs as they care for those with coronavirus.Dr. Vanessa Walker and life coach Angela Trapp co-facilitate a peer group that helps health care professionals work through the mental health toll those providers experience on the job.Walker's primary job right now is working in the intensive care unit tending to coronavirus patients. She tries not to get anxious about the fact that as a pulmonary and critical care physician, she's putting her life on the line each day working in an ICU."I don't really process it," she said. "I don't let it in because it's too overwhelming if you do." Walker also holds another role that weighs on her heavily. She's on the team tasked with creating policies and protocols for how Sutter Health will allocate resources if and when they see a surge in coronavirus patients."When we're making plans for this, the fact is we are considering how are we going to give people these resources and unfortunately how are we going to take them away," said Walker. "And that's probably what has bothered me the most about this whole thing because that's not something I'm prepared to do."That's where a coach like Angela Trapp comes in."It's OK to be afraid," Trapp said. "We want to normalize that fear and anxiety. Yes you're a physician. Yes, you signed up for this, but you're also a human being, and as a human being, those fears are natural."Among the main fears Trapp says health care providers are grappling with now: the worry about exposing their own children and their parents to the coronavirus after a day on the job. She says it's important for those anxieties to be acknowledged, especially as these providers are practicing in unprecedented times."This is the time to be OK with being vulnerable," Trapp said. "Having peers support each other and creating that safe space... that's what's gonna get us through."Other methods Trapp suggests using as coping mechanisms include:Control what you can through planning. Find peace in preparation.Have a mantra -- something that strengthens and brings calm at the same time.Maintain daily routines -- like keeping up with exercise.Shine a light on successes."Everybody wants to focus on the people, unfortunately, losing their lives or getting very sick," said Walker. "The way I think we definitely cope with it is, every time we win, we celebrate it."Another important piece of advice from the experts: keep an eye out on fellow colleagues. Watch for signs of overwhelm and stress. Know that there are resources available for doctors and other health care providers. The nonprofit organization Sierra Sacramento Valley Medical Society's "Joy of Medicine" program offers counseling sessions to health care providers by video conference and telephone 24/7.

Advertisement                       Dr. Vanessa Walker and life coach Angela Trapp co-facilitate a peer group that helps health care professionals work through the mental health toll those providers experience on the job. Walker's primary job right now is working in the intensive care unit tending to coronavirus patients.  She tries not to get anxious about the fact that as a pulmonary and critical care physician, she's putting her life on the line each day working in an ICU. "I don't really process it," she said. "I don't let it in because it's too overwhelming if you do."                                                                                                            Inside a New York hospital that is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and deaths                           Walker also holds another role that weighs on her heavily. She's on the team tasked with creating policies and protocols for how Sutter Health will allocate resources if and when they see a surge in coronavirus patients. "When we're making plans for this, the fact is we are considering how are we going to give people these resources and unfortunately how are we going to take them away," said Walker. "And that's probably what has bothered me the most about this whole thing because that's not something I'm prepared to do." That's where a coach like Angela Trapp comes in. "It's OK to be afraid," Trapp said. "We want to normalize that fear and anxiety. Yes you're a physician. Yes, you signed up for this, but you're also a human being, and as a human being, those fears are natural." Among the main fears Trapp says health care providers are grappling with now: the worry about exposing their own children and their parents to the coronavirus after a day on the job.  She says it's important for those anxieties to be acknowledged, especially as these providers are practicing in unprecedented times.                                                                                                       Central Park becomes a field hospital for New York, where coronavirus deaths have topped 1,000                          "This is the time to be OK with being vulnerable," Trapp said. "Having peers support each other and creating that safe space... that's what's gonna get us through." Other methods Trapp suggests using as coping mechanisms include: Control what you can through planning. Find peace in preparation. Have a mantra -- something that strengthens and brings calm at the same time. Maintain daily routines -- like keeping up with exercise. Shine a light on successes. "Everybody wants to focus on the people, unfortunately, losing their lives or getting very sick," said Walker. "The way I think we definitely cope with it is, every time we win, we celebrate it." Another important piece of advice from the experts: keep an eye out on fellow colleagues. Watch for signs of overwhelm and stress. Know that there are resources available for doctors and other health care providers.  The nonprofit organization Sierra Sacramento Valley Medical Society's  "Joy of Medicine"  program offers counseling sessions to health care providers by video conference and telephone 24/7. All calls are confidential and free of charge to the providers.              ﻿

All Kohl's locations will be closed until further notice.

Kohl’s announced it will continue to keep its stores closed nationwide to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.All stores were closed March 19. The store closings have affected about 85,000 employees nationwide."These are unprecedented times as our communities around the country come together to support the nationwide efforts in slowing the spread of COVID-19. At Kohl’s we are committed to doing our part as we extend the duration of our store closures to protect the health and safety of our customers and our associates," Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass said.All Kohl's locations will be closed until further notice."As a company, we operate with great discipline to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are taking difficult and decisive actions to strengthen our financial liquidity and secure the financial position of the company for the long-term benefit of our associates, customers and shareholders," Gass said.Kohl's said earlier this month that it would pay all associates for two weeks during the shutdown.All store and distribution center associates will be furloughed.Some corporate workers will also be furloughed, Kohl's announced.The company will continue to provide health benefits to furloughed employees.Gass said she will not accept her salary during the store shutdown and employee furlough."It is an incredibly difficult decision to extend our store closures and temporarily furlough some of our associates," Gass said. "We look forward to the day that we can reopen our stores to welcome our associates back and serve the millions of families across the country that shop Kohl’s."Orders will continue to be shipped directly to customers' homes.Beginning April 2, customers can also pick up items at stores from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. within two hours of ordering online.

Coronavirus is having a major impact on the race for Baltimore mayor.

Coronavirus is having a major impact on the race for Baltimore mayor.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||At least for the time being, gone are the days of mass campaign events, shaking hands and door-knocking. Candidates have to be more creative than ever in getting their message out.Currently, the campaign trail has gone digital. Candidates are relying on phone banks, tele-town hall meetings, text messages and advertising to get out their message."It's all coronavirus all the time on the media, and that's all anybody's talking about, and so for these candidates, the question is for them, where are we going to spend money right now," said Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Huges Field Politics Center.During this time of crisis, candidates are pushing their coronavirus-education platforms."I'm using my platforms, which are my campaign website and my social media platform, to try to educate people about the dangers of the coronavirus. At the same time, it is essential I'm still campaigning, I'm staying active, digitally and socially," candidate T.J. Smith said.Candidate Thiru Vignarajah built an in-house studio to communicate with voters. He has also purchased billboard space."We have billboards all across town that are sharing COVID-19-related information and public health messages, and we offered the city and state to transmit their messages through those billboards as well," Vignarajah said.Candidate Mary Miller is on TV and all social media platforms."We are using social media, we are using video content, we are trying to reach voters in every way we can in a safe manner," Miller said.Mayor Jack Young is no longer on the campaign trail. His campaign manager, Myles Handy, sent a written statement to 11 News, saying: "The mayor's sole focus is the health and safety of Baltimore's residents. Our campaign continues to organize supporters through phone banking, text messaging and social media.""Nobody is really paying attention to the race for mayor. So they may want to hold onto that money and really capture people's attention closer to the finish line," Kromer said.The finish line is the primary on June 2, which the governor moved from April 28. One of the last polls indicates the candidates have a lot of work to do because a majority of voters are undecided.             BALTIMORE

Travelers take precautions to lower coronavirus risk at BWI-Marshall

While state authorities believe a possible coronavirus outbreak is a low-level risk, it's not stopping concerns from spreading from travelers to local businesses to even schools.

While state authorities believe a possible coronavirus outbreak is a low-level risk, it's not stopping concerns from spreading from travelers to local businesses to even schools.Some travelers at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport are heeding the governor's warnings and taking precautions as the administration is taking steps to stop the possible spread of the coronavirus."These are the kinds of things people should start planning for right now," Hogan said. "A month ago, at my direction, our administration initiated actions for the preparation and mobilization of all necessary resources in order to address the coronavirus."Precautions that are now geared toward local businesses, schools and airports like the BWI-Marshall."It's definitely scary. You're hearing it more and more. It's not something that's been going away, like Ebola. It's been in the news for quite some time, so to hear it come to Maryland is pretty terrifying," said traveler Kem Udo."It's a little scary because they really don't know how infectious it is compared to a normal cold or flu," said traveler Christian Johnson.State officials are urging people to start preparing, just in case they need to be quarantined at home for a short or long period of time.The $10 million the governor says he will add in a supplemental budget for emergency preparedness and preventative measures is coming with positive response."Glad that something is hopefully being done." Udo said.Though some are taking his warnings lightly."I think there would be quarantines that would be going on, and then I think there would be cause for concern. But, right now, I don't think so. People coughing around me all day today," said traveler Stuart Sheer.Efforts continue to be a top priority to keep the potential spread at a minimum."I may invest in some face masks," Udo said."Mostly just wash my hands before I eat, try to be mindful of keeping my hands clean and stuff while eating, or if I'm in public places where the chance of infection is higher," said Johnson.​             BALTIMORE

Anne Arundel County police said substances tested in syringes in connection to an assault last week in Churchton was semen.

Anne Arundel County police said substances tested in syringes in connection to an assault last week in Churchton was semen. Police initially said they learned the syringe in question contained semen. Officials later said police are unsure if any of those were the syringe in question.Police said they were notified about the assault which happened in the 5500 block of Shady Side Road, where a woman was assaulted and poked with what she believed to be a syringe.The victim, Katie Peters, told 11 News on Wednesday that she felt safe going out in public now that the suspect, Thomas Bryon Stemen, 51, is in jail. Peters said she thought she was burned by a cigarette butt at a grocery store cart-return area. She said she confronted Stemen there and that he said, "It felt like a bee sting didn't it?"According to police, they received an anonymous tip that led them to Stemen, 51, and the recovery of the syringe full of liquid from the driver's side door of his vehicle.A judge ordered Stemen held without bail on first- and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment charges. Detectives believe there may be additional victims who have yet to report similar incidents. This investigation is extremely active additional charges may be applicable. Anyone with any information is asked to call Southern District at 410-222-1960 or the tip line 410-222-4700. This story will be updated.              SHADY SIDE, Md.

Many Maryland school districts have stepped up their public information campaigns regarding a possible coronavirus outbreak.|| CDC information on coronavirus | Link: Maryland resources on coronavirus  ||The nation's school systems are being told to stay on alert. Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday afternoon that schools and daycares should have contingency plans in place in case of closures.From Anne Arundel to Howard counties, school officials in Maryland told 11 News they want to make sure parents and students stay in the loop when it comes to COVID-19, the novel coronavirus.President Donald Trump, pressed on whether schools should prepare for the possible spreading of the coronavirus, had this to say to reporters Wednesday evening: "I would think so, yes. I mean, I haven't spoken specifically about that with the various doctors, but I would think so, yes."Even without specific guidance from the federal government, local school systems started sending letters to parents and the public more than a month ago."We are very much in a preparation mode," Howard County schools Superintendent Michael Martirano said.Howard County is one of the Maryland school districts still warning parents to keep their children at home if they show symptoms of the virus, all while staying connected to local, state and federal health officials."We're taking our lead from the Howard County Health Department, great partners for us, the Maryland State Health Department, as well as the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), getting accurate information out to our community," Martirano said.Right before the president's press conference on coronavirus, Harford County school officials sent a recorded telephone voice message to the homes of its 38,000 students. The district said it's prepared to field questions from anxious parents and residents.Across the state, custodians have been on hand to clean classrooms and other parts of school buildings to try and limit the spread of the flu and, if necessary, the coronavirus.Anne Arundel County school officials said, in a worst-case scenario, it already has technology in place to allow schools to connect with students at home."Yeah, I think schools should be preparing, get ready just in case, the words are 'just in case,'" Trump said.The University System of Maryland is monitoring the spread of the coronavirus.

Aw! Police deliver cherry pies to 102-year-old woman for her birthday

With a statewide stay-at-home order in effect for Colorado, city employees wanted to show their love for the community.

The Arvada Police Department ended a long week by celebrating a long life. When police heard Susie Montoya was celebrating her 102nd birthday, and someone wanted to send her a cherry pie, officers went on a mission to make sure it was done safely.With a statewide stay-at-home order in effect, city employees wanted to show their love for the community. So they ordered the pies from a local business: Rheinlander Bakery.Then, Det. Dave Snelling took the pies to the crime lab for processing. He put on a mask and gloves, cleaned the boxes with disinfectant wipes, and packaged them in a brown paper bag for safe delivery.He even arranged for Arvada firefighters to oversee the delivery.“We’re going to give out these pies all while maintaining COVID CDC standards, maintaining our distance and using proper procedures to make sure that keep this entire family safe,” Snelling stated. He even reminded the family to wash their hands before helping themselves to the pie.Montoya watched from an upstairs window as well-wishers sang Happy Birthday to her and Snelling officially declared it “Susie Montoya Day.”“I know what you’re thinking… ‘Dave, is all this that important? Why are you using resources to this?'” Snelling said. “I will tell you, absolutely, it’s important. Because Susie Montoya is turning 102 years old today.'” Video: Teachers hold parade for students stuck at home due to coronavirus             ARVADA, Colo. (KCNC)

A large earthquake struck north of Boise, Idaho, Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking. The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 5 p.m. It was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, Idaho, near the rural mountain town of Stanley.Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn't interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho's coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases in the nation outside of New York City and surrounding counties.“It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said. The earthquake is added stress during an already stressful time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.”Brett Woolley, a restaurant owner in Stanley, said he heard earthquake coming before he felt it. “I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I'm sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”City officials began checking facilities while public safety officers conducted structural checks in the city's downtown area and in neighborhoods according to Mayor Lauren McLean.This is a developing story.

An increasing number of people around the world and in Maryland are stepping up to fight the coronavirus, whether it's companies changing their production models or people at home sewing masks, and it's affecting the economy.

An increasing number of people around the world and in Maryland are stepping up to fight the coronavirus, whether it's companies changing their production models or people at home sewing masks, and it's affecting the economy.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Some would say there's a ramping up of a community effort similar, albeit on a smaller scale, to what was seen during World War II -- people and businesses using their crafts to help battle the coronavirus, causing a shift in what has become a very unstable economy.In Carroll County, a group of women and families who call themselves the COVID-19 Carroll County Mask Makers is sewing masks for first responders and medical staff around the state. So far, they have created 2,000 masks."It makes us feel good because we feel helpless, and I feel most people feel helpless, and they're saying, 'What can we do? What can we do?'" said Nora Murray, with the COVID-19 Carroll County Mask Makers.It's is just one of many examples around Maryland in which both individuals and companies are stepping up to help battle the coronavirus.Under Armour is switching up its operations to sew masks. At Loyola University Maryland, faculty and staff are using 3-D printers and laser cutters to create face shields for hospitals.Many Maryland distilleries are making hand sanitizer for the public and hospitals, and GAP Inc. is creating masks, scrubs and gowns for hospitals."We came into this year very strong economically. Unemployment in Maryland (was) 3.3%. Unemployment nationally (was) 3.5%. And the forecast was this was going to be a decent year for the economy, at least the first half of the year. All that has fallen apart, obviously," said Anirban Basu, an economist with the Sage Policy Group.Basu said the shifting of companies and individuals is socially beneficial and has helped some people keep their jobs.The recent 25% unemployment rate has caused a depression-like mentality, but it's still much different than the Great Depression of 1933."In 1929, the U.S. unemployment was 4% -- about where it had been prior to our COVID-19 crisis -- and then, it takes four years to get up to 25%. So that was a grinding decline in economic activity. This is a very sudden one," Basu said.Economists expect to see more large companies to shift their ways, including some automakers, and they expect a more robust recovery by the fourth quarter of this year.

Maryland governor issues stay-at-home order amid coronavirus pandemic

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic.The executive order took effect at 8 p.m. Monday."This virus is spreading rapidly and exponentially," Hogan said. "We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home, we are directing them to do so."Anyone who violates the order will be guilty of a misdemeanor that carries a possible sentence of up to one year in prison and/or a fine of up to $5,000.|| Read the governor's executive order here ||"No Marylander shall be leaving their home unless it is for an essential job or an essential reason such as obtaining food or medicine, seeking urgent medical attention or for other necessary purposes," Hogan said.The governor said only essential needs are exempt from the order"People are not locked in their homes. We're just telling people that they need to stay in their homes except for essential and necessary things. We want people who have to go out and get food, they need to get prescriptions, you should be able to get outside for your own physical and mental well-being, you should be able to go for a walk and take your dog for a walk. You should not be going out in a crowd of people congregating at a park somewhere," Hogan said.|| Recreation: Department of Natural Resources FAQ on stay-home order ||"We need to protect ourselves and to save lives. So don't go out. Only take a walk by yourself or with the people that you live with, and only for a very short period of time," Maryland Health Secretary Fran Phillips said.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||As of Monday morning, there are 1,413 confirmed coronavirus cases in Maryland and 15 deaths. There have been as many as 13,316 negative test results. The youngest case to date is that of a 1-month-old infant.Officials said Maryland is expected to hit New York coronavirus levels by Easter."We are only at the beginning of this crisis, and it's going to get incredibly worse before it gets better. We are going to get through this together," Hogan said.The pandemic is on track to swamp the Maryland region in two weeks, and that puts the entire nation at risk."A major outbreak among our critical federal workforce could be catastrophic, crippling the national response," Hogan said."We know that there are clusters of concern under investigation around the state," Phillips said.The governor said Marylanders should not be traveling out of state and anyone who has traveled out of state recently should self-quarantine for 14 days.Hogan said residents should reschedule appointments."Marylanders should reschedule all nonessential appointments of any kind," Hogan said.Only essential businesses are allowed to remain open in Maryland, and those businesses are to scale down operations and staff. Essential businesses must take more steps to scale down in-person operations and institute telework for as much of their workforce as possible.|| List of what is considered essential business |||| Update: Additional businesses, organizations, facilities that may remain open ||From the governor's office: "Additional Guidance for Businesses. In addition, only essential businesses are allowed to remain open in Maryland, and those businesses must make every effort to scale down their operations in order to reduce the number of required staff, to limit interactions with customers, and to institute telework for as much of the workforce as is practical. This order does not change what businesses are deemed essential or nonessential.""Curbside Pickup. Restaurants may continue selling food and drink on a carry-out or drive-through basis; however, because residents of Maryland are not permitted to leave their homes to purchase products from nonessential businesses, curbside pickup at nonessential businesses is no longer permitted. Read the interpretive guidance."The Maryland Automobile Dealers Association said Tuesday that car and truck dealerships are deemed to be essential businesses by the Office of Legal Counsel for the state of Maryland and allows automobile dealers to remain open. MADA has recommended to its members that sales activity should be conducted by appointment only or conducted online.Service and parts departments can remain open, but social distancing guidelines will be enforced. Management and back-office operations will be limited to essential function only and telecommuting will be used whenever possible, the governor's office said.Watch: Getting answers to your questions about the stay-home orderThe governor also said only essential personnel should be using public transportation or unless travel is absolutely necessary.Hogan said the state has reached a critical turning point."Every single Marylander can be a hero just by staying home and by practicing social distancing. This will not only keep you and your family safe, but it could also save the lives of thousands of others," Hogan said. "In the days to come, we are all going to need to depend on each other, look out for each other and to take care of each other because we are all in this together."Hogan's message for anyone still downplaying the severity of the virus and refusing to take it seriously: More American deaths are expected from the virus than from the Vietnam and Korean wars combined.The Archdiocese of Baltimore announced Monday that all parish churches will be closed until further notice to comply with the governor's order. The closure means churches will no longer be open for private prayer.Funeral Masses have also been suspended, with only graveside services taking place with no more than 10 people present, including the priest performing the Rite of Committal.

Florida sheriff getting 6 tips a day for 1997 'Tiger King' disappearance
.W
A Florida sheriff is using the hype surrounding the wildly popular Netflix series "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness" to seek new leads in a missing person case.

A Florida sheriff is using the hype surrounding the wildly popular Netflix series "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness" to seek new leads in the case of Jack Donald "Don" Lewis, who's been missing since 1997.Lewis was married to Big Cat Rescue owner Carole Baskin, the intended target of the murder-for-hire plot at the center of the docuseries.Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister told CNN that the show has generated a lot of new interest in the case. His office is receiving about six tips a day, he said."We are already receiving new tips and we hope to close this cold case soon with the help of the public," Chronister told CNN. "Since the documentary came out we've been receiving about six tips a day related to this case. We are looking into each one thoroughly."In a video news conference on Tuesday, Chronister told reporters that he has assigned a detective supervisor to chase down any new leads generated from the show."The case remains open; We never close a cold case," he said.So far, none of the tips have been credible, he said.He also posted a new call for information on his personal Twitter account."Since @netflix and #Covid19 #Quarantine has made #TigerKing all the rage, I figured it was a good time to ask for new leads," he wrote. He tweeted a poster with information about Lewis and encouraged anyone with information to call the Sheriff's Office nonemergency number.Lewis, who would be 81, was last seen on August 18, 1997, according to the sheriff's post.Chronister told reporters that he has watched the series and said it was "interesting," but that it didn't present any information that investigators hadn't checked out."They certainly spun it a certain way for entertainment purposes," he said.Chronister said the case was extremely convoluted and that everyone involved had theories about what happened to Lewis.He said investigators have never found enough probable cause to charge anyone with a crime — or even to determine that a crime had been committed.At the time, they did not have GPS or mobile phones that might have helped locate Lewis, Chronister said.Investigators have entered DNA samples from Lewis' relatives into law enforcement databases in hopes of finding a match, he said.Oklahoma zoo owner "Joe Exotic" (Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage), serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in the Baskin murder-for-hire plot and other charges, has repeatedly accused Baskin of killing her husband and feeding his body to the tigers at her animal rescue center.He claimed that a septic tank on the Big Cat Rescue property might hold evidence.Chronister said the septic tank wasn't even there at the time that Lewis disappeared.Baskin has denied any involvement in the disappearance. CNN reached out to Baskin but has not heard back.Chronister said Baskin declined to take a polygraph test a few years ago because her attorney said it would not vindicate her if she passed. He said they haven't seen any new evidence that would justify asking again.Lewis often traveled to Costa Rica, and Chronister said they have looked into the possibility that he may have fled there. However, there is no evidence that he chartered a plane and there is no record that he used either of his two passports to leave the country."Like any case at the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office we want to bring closure to the families involved and the community. We are seeing greater interest in this case thanks to Tiger King and we encourage anyone who knows something to call 813-247-8200," Chronister said.

Doctor whose hospital was converted due to coronavirus shares practical steps to stay safe
.W
How do you prevent getting the disease? Should you wear face masks? A New York City physician answers these questions and more.

A New York City physician gave tips on how to protect you and your family as the coronavirus outbreak continues.Dr. Dave Price of New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center provided the information. His hospital has been converted to almost exclusively help COVID-19 patients, he said.“I don’t want you guys to be scared,” he said in a video call, which was uploaded on and around March 22. “We’re three months into this in the medical world and we understand this disease.”Above video: Officials are telling Americans to stay home to stop the spread of COVID-19He noted how the key way the virus spreads is through hand-to-face contact, and he also answered questions. He also discussed how and when to use hand sanitizer, which is a secondary way to keep your hands clean. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes one should wash one's hands for 20 seconds due to COVID-19, but if soap and water are unavailable, use a sanitizer.) Here are Price's remarks, summarized and shortened.WHAT DOES THE DISEASE LOOK LIKE?People who have symptoms commonly have fever, cough and sore throat. The virus goes into one's entire body, but the most likely place it will affect is your lungs.Most people just don’t feel good. You have a mild cough — maybe mild headache.The vast majority of people are going to have a fever, body aches, feel terrible for three-five days, feel a little less terrible on day seven then feel a little bit better.The disease lasts five to seven to 14 days. Some people feel better after five days.HOW DO YOU GET COVID-19? The virus is transmitted almost exclusively from one’s hands to face by eyes, nose or mouth, he said.There's some thought it could be aerosolized. He said the current thought is you have to have 15-30 minutes in close contact, such as a closed room, for you to get it that way without any type of mask."The overwhelming majority of people are getting this disease by physically touching someone who has this disease or will develop it in the next one-two days and then touching their face," he said. "That I think is incredibly empowering," Price said, adding that he knows he won’t get the disease because he knows how to protect himself.The "vast, vast, vast" majority of transmission is by droplet, meaning hands to face. The droplet can come from an infected person's mouth and go to hand or surface. That, in turn, is very quickly taken up by another person and put on their face.It happens with sustained contact with someone who has this disease (where the vast majority has fever or aches) or someone who is about to get the disease, meaning someone in the next one-two days is going to develop symptoms of the disease.People get it through sustained contact, such as shaking one’s hand then touching your face.HOW EFFECTIVE IS CLEANING YOUR HANDS AGAINST THE DISEASE? Cleaning one’s hands and not touching your face will help 99% of cases, he said.When he leaves his apartment and touches an elevator button or door handle with his hand, he uses hand sanitizer."Everything we touch, we clean our hands," he said. "Become a hand Nazi." He described the coronavirus as a wimp that dies as soon as you disinfect it. He also said a small drop of hand sanitizer will do the job.SHOULD YOU USE A FACE MASK?You don’t need a medical mask. These masks that people are wearing are not protecting them from the disease, and front-line medical workers need them. You don’t need a wild supply. The general community has zero need for N95 masks.But masks or bandanas can be helpful for you to stop touching your face; if you leave your house and wear a mask, it can help. He encourages people to wear a mask — not because you’re going to get COVID-19 that way. But it will train you not to touch your face and show people you’re serious about the disease.WHAT ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING?Stay three to six feet away from people.When you go to the pharmacy, you don’t have to wait directly in front of someone. You can stand a few steps back.If you go to grocery store, if you touch cart, just clean the handle; if you see people around, don’t touch them.  He also stressed the importance of shrinking your social circle. He recommended finding your isolation group, such as three or four people or your family, and setting boundaries.WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU GET THE DISEASE?The vast majority of spread throughout the world is through home and family transmission.You shouldn’t be scared to stay at home with your family with a fever if you have COVID-19. You can have COVID in your house and be safe and not have everyone else get it.If you have COVID-19 and you’ve recovered for seven days and you’re feeling better, you can return to your family’s life.If you’re able, have the person who is sick in a separate room and with their own bathroom; have person who is sick wear a mask if they have to interact with their family. (An exception to this is if you have someone vulnerable in your family, such as someone who recently had chemotherapy or is 95 years old, you should find another living arrangement.)WHAT DO I DO IF I HAVE A MILD COLD?If you have a cold or feel like you’re getting sick, take precautions like you have COVID-19 for one to two days. If after that time you feel better and it’s like the thousands of other colds you’ve had, you can return to normal activities.WHEN DO YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL?"If you’re feeling short of breath, come to the hospital. … It’s not, ‘I have a fever.’ It’s not, ‘I think I have COVID-19.’ It’s not, ‘I can’t stop having these body aches.’ It’s, ‘I feel short of breath when I get up to go to the bathroom."Those people should be evaluated at a hospital.A lot of people who come to his emergency room are sent home so they can recover on their own for three to five days.Of all people infected, about 10 percent need to go to hospital because they’re short of breath. Of those, about one to 3% require admission to an intensive care unit and put on a ventilator. The vast majority of people put on ventilator come off the ventilator, which happens seven to 10 days later."Going to the hospital is not a death sentence," he said. "It’s a safe place for you to be."SHOULD I GET TESTED?Price thinks it depends on the availability of testing in your home.If you have clear access to testing, it’s a good idea. Because when it’s negative, you can have full interaction with your community. But if there’s very rare testing, don’t try to jump the line.WHO DOES THIS DISEASE AFFECT? WHAT ABOUT NEWBORNS AND KIDS? There's been almost no disease among children from ages zero to 14.Outside of that age group, you can end up on ventilator. The younger you are, the less likely that is to happen. The older you are, the more likely it is to happen. But we see young people who get sick and older people who do just fine. IS IT SAFE TO GO ON A RUN OR WALK?Yes, even if you’re in a city. Just follow the rules with hand sanitizer. Don’t touch your face. Don’t come into three to six feet of people.  SHOULD YOU DISINFECT GROCERY ITEMS?The general answer is no.If you live in New York City where there’s a lot of contact, it can be reasonable to leave takeout outside one's door and pick it up with a glove.But don’t high-five or shake a delivery person’s hand.He doesn’t think routine groceries need to be wiped down.IS IT OK TO GET COFFEE AT A DRIVE-THRU?It depends. If you can safely interact and follow the rules with hand sanitizer, it's OK. His general sense is to make coffee at home.IF YOU RETURN HOME, SHOULD YOU THEN WASH YOUR CLOTHES ONCE YOU GET BACK?Absolutely not. That’s a recommendation for health care providers.IF YOU GET SICK, HOW LONG SHOULD YOU WAIT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL?Don’t go unless you’re short of breath, such as due to walking or sitting. If you have a fever, stay home.With telehealth, if you feel sick and you’re a little nervous, there are an army of doctors waiting to help.SHOULD YOU USE IBUPROFEN WITH A FEVER?Research suggests that the inflammation could be worse, so if you have a fever, take Tylenol.WHAT DOES TREATMENT LOOK LIKE?All patients look exactly the same: They have a cough and fever.When they get sick, they are short of breath. When they can’t walk to the bathroom, then they’re put on a ventilator. Around seven-10 days later, they’re taken off a ventilator.Many are scared. Medical staff tell patients they’re being put on ventilators so they can be taken off them.ARE HOSPITALS ACCEPTING HOMEMADE MASKS?The main role for a homemade mask should be for you to use so you can give manufactured face masks to medical providers who need them.HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST?He thinks social distancing will be needed for months to possibly up to a year. He thinks based on the experience from Wuhan, Singapore and South Korea is to flatten the curve so hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. There could be a second small spike when people become more relaxed.

Dr. Dave Price of New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center provided the information.

If you can safely interact and follow the rules with hand sanitizer, it's OK. His general sense is to make coffee at home. IF YOU RETURN HOME, SHOULD YOU THEN WASH YOUR CLOTHES ONCE YOU GET BACK? Absolutely not. That’s a recommendation for health care providers. IF YOU GET SICK, HOW LONG SHOULD YOU WAIT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL? Don’t go unless you’re short of breath, such as due to walking or sitting. If you have a fever, stay home. With telehealth, if you feel sick and you’re a little nervous, there are an army of doctors waiting to help. SHOULD YOU USE IBUPROFEN WITH A FEVER? Research suggests that the inflammation could be worse, so if you have a fever, take Tylenol. WHAT DOES TREATMENT LOOK LIKE? All patients look exactly the same: They have a cough and fever. When they get sick, they are short of breath. When they can’t walk to the bathroom, then they’re put on a ventilator. Around seven-10 days later, they’re taken off a ventilator. Many are scared. Medical staff tell patients they’re being put on ventilators so they can be taken off them. ARE HOSPITALS ACCEPTING HOMEMADE MASKS? The main role for a homemade mask should be for you to use so you can give manufactured face masks to medical providers who need them. HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST? He thinks social distancing will be needed for months to possibly up to a year. He thinks based on the experience from Wuhan, Singapore and South Korea is to flatten the curve so hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. There could be a second small spike when people become more relaxed.

The world's largest coronavirus lockdown is having a dramatic impact on pollution in India
.W
Grinding a country of 1.3 billion people to a near halt has provided a temporary remedy to another pressing health issue: suffocating pollution levels.

When India imposed a nationwide lockdown a week ago, it was designed to stop the imminent spread of the novel coronavirus.But grinding this country of 1.3 billion people to a near halt has also provided a temporary remedy to another pressing health issue: suffocating pollution levels.  The world's largest lockdown means all factories, markets, shops, and places of worship are now closed, most public transport suspended and construction work halted, as India asks its citizens to stay home and practice social distancing. So far, India has more than 1,300 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 35 deaths.Already, data shows that the main cities are recording much lower levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5, and of nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants.PM 2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks.The sudden fall in pollutants and the subsequent blue skies signal a dramatic shift for India — which has 21 of the world's 30 most polluted cities, according to the IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report.In the capital, New Delhi, government data shows the average concentration of PM 2.5 plunged by 71% in the space of a week — falling from 91 microgram per cubic meter on March 20, to 26 on March 27, after the lockdown began. The World Health Organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe.The data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), part of India's Environment Ministry, was collated by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).Nitrogen dioxide went from 52 per cubic meter to 15 in the same period — also a 71% fall. Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore have also recorded a fall in these air pollutants."I have not seen such blue skies in Delhi for the past 10 years," said Jyoti Pande Lavakare, the co-founder of Indian environmental organization Care for Air, and author of upcoming book "Breathing Here is Injurious To Your Health.""It is a silver lining in terms of this awful crisis that we can step outside and breathe."Related video: NASA images show China pollution decline from economic slowdownLowest traffic pollutionEven before the national lockdown started on March 25, the phased shutdowns in India were having an impact.During the first three weeks of March, the average nitrogen dioxide levels declined by 40-50% in the cities of Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019, said Gufran Beig, a scientist with the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under India's Ministry of Earth Sciences."The reduced fossil fuel emissions due to (the) transport sector and slowdown in other emissions-related activity is slowly reducing the air pollutants," Beig said.The nationwide curfew in India on March 22 also resulted in the lowest one-day traffic pollution levels on record, analysis from CREA said. Other dangerous pollutants, PM2.5 and the larger PM10, which are less than 10 micrometers in diameter, also dropped steeply, the report added."It is most likely that even the record of March 22 will be broken, and we are seeing more and more cleaner days as industries, transportation and energy generation and demand are reducing across the country," said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst based in New Delhi for CREA.Similar patterns showing drastic falls in pollution levels were seen in parts of Europe and China since their lockdowns, as industry and transport networks grind to a virtual halt.But this data is no reason to celebrate, Dahiya said."This is a really grave situation which the entire world is grappling with," Dahiya said."Pollution is going down, but we cannot let the suffering of so many human beings be the way to clean the air," Dahiya said."We can only use the outbreak of coronavirus as a learning lesson for us."Pollution protestIt's a lesson that is badly needed in India, activists say.In November 2019, hundreds of Indians took to the streets in New Delhi to protest the levels of air pollution, after the city was blanketed in a dark yellow haze for several days.Air pollution hit record high levels, forcing schools to close and flights to be diverted. Other cities in northern India also suffered.Four months later, the skies are now clearing up. But the impact of living in such badly polluted conditions has left a hidden problem for residents: a potential vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic — a severe respiratory disease.India has one of the highest rates of respiratory disease in the world, and the world's highest number of tuberculosis cases. Such widespread lung damage could potentially increase the risks associated with the coronavirus."(There are) very high levels of respiratory disease, even among young children, they have asthma, the nebulizer has become a normal thing to have in the house for families who can afford them," said Lavakare from Care for Air.According to the WHO, older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions, including asthma, appear to be a higher risk of becoming severely ill with the virus.Investing in a cleaner futureGlobally, deaths related to exposure to air pollution are of pandemic proportions, with 7 million deaths every year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.Care for Air said this should be a wake-up call for India to address the problem."Obviously, this is not the most ideal way to bring down air pollution, but it does prove that air pollution is manmade," Lavakare said. "It gives a lot of encouragement and hope that we can bring pollution down."The coronavirus crisis also presents India with an opportunity to invest in a clean energy future, said Dahiya from CREA."India (is) a highly fossil-fueled country," said Dahiya. "In order to tackle pollution, we need to tackle that.""When we come out of the outbreak, it will be interesting to see if we invest money in the cleaner future," he added. "(Do) we ramp up the old fossil fuel based intensive industries, or we go towards more sustainable options."Lavakare said that at the minimum, the government should commit to keeping existing policy pledges."Governments cannot use this disruption as an excuse to go back against the gains that have been made," she said. "Right now, we have a priority, we need to stop this big crisis."But when things are under better control ... we need to move towards renewable energy faster. It would be really sad (if) we make the same mistake again, using coal and non-renewable energy."

France closes the Louvre, staff walk out amid virus fears
.W
Staff at the Louvre museum in Paris staged a walkout after management was unable to reassure them they were not at risk of coronavirus contamination.

Coronavirus cases surged in Italy, and France closed the Louvre Museum on Sunday as the deadly outbreak that began in China sent fear rising across Western Europe. The number of countries hit by the virus climbed past 60, and the death toll worldwide reached at least 3,000.Louvre management held a meeting Sunday morning to discus the virus outbreak, and assure workers their risk of receiving the virus was limited, Reuters reports. But workers remained uncertain, and refused to return to work following the meeting, instead staging a walkout.Another meeting is scheduled for Monday, a spokewoman said, but she was not clear if the Louvre was expected to reopen.New fronts in the crisis opened rapidly over the weekend, deepening the sense of crisis that has already sent financial markets plummeting, emptied the streets in many cities of tourists and workers and rewritten the daily routines of millions of people. More than 87,000 worldwide have been infected, with the virus appearing on every continent but Antarctica.Australia and Thailand reported their first deaths Sunday, while the Dominican Republic and the Czech Republic recorded their first infections.Italian authorities announced that the number of people infected in the country had surged 40% to 1,576 in 24 hours, and five more people had died, bringing the death toll there to 34. Iran, Iraq and South Korea, among other places, also saw the number of infections rise. Cases in the U.S. climbed to at least 72, with the first death inside the United States reported on Saturday — a man in his 50s in Washington state who had underlying health problems but hadn’t traveled to any affected areas. Panic-buying of daily necessities emerged in Japan, where professional baseball teams have played spring-training games in deserted stadiums. Tourist sites across Asia, Europe and the Mideast were deserted. Islam's holiest sites have been closed to foreign pilgrims. And governments have closed schools and banned big gatherings.In France, the archbishop of Paris told parish priests to put the Communion bread in worshippers' hands, not in their mouths. French officials advised people to forgo the customary kisses on the cheek upon greeting others. And the Louvre closed after workers who guard the “Mona Lisa” and the rest of its priceless artworks expressed fear of being contaminated by the stream of visitors from around the world.The Louvre, the world's most popular museum, got 9.6 million visitors last year, almost three-quarters of them from abroad.Louvre staffers were also concerned about museum workers from Italy who had come to the museum to collect works by Leonardo da Vinci that were loaned for a major exhibition. “We are very worried because we have visitors from everywhere,” said Andre Sacristin, a Louvre employee and union representative. “The risk is very, very, very great." While there are no known infections among the museum's 2,300 workers, “it’s only a question of time,” he said.The shutdown followed a government decision Saturday to ban indoor public gatherings of more than 5,000 people.Among the frustrated visitors was Charles Lim from Singapore. He and his wife, Jeanette, chose Paris to celebrate their first wedding anniversary and bought tickets in advance for the Louvre. “We waited for about three hours before giving up,” he said. “It was incredibly disappointing.”China, where the outbreak began two months ago, on Sunday reported a slight uptick in new cases over the past 24 hours to 573, the first time in five days that the number exceeded 500. They remain almost entirely confined to the hardest-hit province of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan.South Korea reported 210 additional cases and two more deaths, raising its totals to 3,736 cases and 20 fatalities. South Korea has the second-largest number of infections outside China, with most of the cases in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas.South Korea's president used a speech marking the 101st anniversary of an anti-Japanese independence uprising to call for national unity to overcome the crisis.Iran's death toll climbed to 54 as the number of confirmed cases jumped overnight by more than half, to 978. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday.Around the world, many cases of the virus have been relatively mild, and some of those infected apparently show no symptoms at all.Reuters contributed to this report.

The Grandeur of the Seas, Royal Caribbean's ship that runs out of Baltimore, suffered an outbreak of the flu.

The Grandeur of the Seas, Royal Caribbean's ship that runs out of Baltimore, suffered an outbreak of the flu.On the trip from Feb. 8-20, the medical staff alerted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that 82 guests or crew members had flu-like symptoms or tested positive for influenza A or B.According to a statement from Royal Caribbean, all were placed in isolation following medical protocol.The CDC decided not to test any of the patients for the coronavirus because they did not meet the criteria for the testing.Royal Caribbean released a statement, saying: "None of the patients had transited regions of impact or been exposed to anyone in the regions of impact, within 14 days of symptom onset."The U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning for people taking cruises in Asia. The Royal Caribbean website states the company has already canceled or modified most cruises in Asia through mid-March.Last month, passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were quarantined on board after a sick passenger tested positive for the coronavirus. American passengers on board were eventually rescued from the ship and flown back to the United States. They were quarantined before they were released.Information on the latest travel advisories can be found on the State Department's website.             BALTIMORE

Coronavirus threat prompts Maryland colleges to cancel study abroad

Some Maryland universities are taking action to protect students against the coronavirus threat.

Some Maryland universities are taking action to protect students against the coronavirus threat.Towson University canceled its student abroad program. Currently, nine study abroad students in Italy have been called back to the United States amid a coronavirus outbreak in that country.University officials said the nine students, at this time, will not be able to return to campus. Instead, they will have to be self-quarantined off campus.TU officials said a decision hasn't been reached yet regarding spring break, summer or fall university travel.Some students told 11 News the decision is the right move."I think it isn't cool that students aren't able to go on their programs, but it's good that they could still be safe," said Ramona Thomas, a student. "I mean, I'm sure that it's definitely possible that disease could spread around at a faster pace. This has happened with other illnesses. But I'm personally not super worried about it because I feel like people do try to take precautions by making sure that they're not getting sick."TU officials said there is no immediate threat on campus.Study abroad programs in Italy at the University of Maryland have also been canceled.

Three Maryland cases that met the criteria for coronavirus testing have come back negative and a new case is being tested, according to the governor's office.

Three Maryland cases that met the criteria for coronavirus testing have come back negative and a new case is being tested, according to the governor's office.|| Maryland Health Department coronavirus information ||On Thursday, state health officials announced that three Marylanders met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for testing for the coronavirus. Those cases have tested negative.There is one new case that is being tested, the governor's office announced Monday.Health officials said the samples were flown to the CDC in Atlanta for testing.Two other cases that were tested earlier in the year came back negative.Gov. Larry Hogan announced last week how the state is addressing the coronavirus threat and how residents should prepare. The governor and state health officials made it clear that Maryland is currently considered a "low-level risk." Hogan said there is no immediate health threat in Maryland, but that the state is taking every precaution to address the coronavirus.State health officials are coordinating with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency and all state, federal and local partners to lead response efforts."We want all Marylanders to know that we're closely monitoring COVID-19 developments and are working with our federal, state and local partners to help keep you safe and healthy," state Health Secretary Robert R. Neall said in a statement. "But everyone can play a role in preparedness -- stay informed and use every day healthy habits to limit your exposure to illness.""Though the public health threat in Maryland remains low, all levels of government are working diligently and in close coordination to prepare for all possible scenarios," Hogan said.Sinai Hospital Preparedness Hospitals in Maryland are prepared and said everyone needs to take precautions to keep from getting sick with any respiratory illness. "I think we all need to be prepared because it's just a matter of time before it spreads from other parts of the country," said Dr. Kjell Wiberg, an infectious disease specialist at Sinai Hospital. Prepared, but not panicked. Wiberg said the coronavirus spreads like any other respiratory virus like a cold or the flu, by coming in contact with infected droplets."The problem with the coronavirus is that because nobody has immunity against it, it tends to make us sicker at this point," Wiberg said. To prevent getting any virus, the same rules of good hygiene apply. Wash your hands or use sanitizer frequently, don't cough into your hand, use your elbow and if you're sick, stay home. Be careful of some hidden areas that harbor germs, doorknobs, gas pumps and cellphones. "My take on that for myself is always if I don't remember when I washed my hands the last time and I've been touching things, I use alcohol sanitizer if I have nothing else to use," Wiberg said.Wiberg also said face masks won't help protect you from getting sick, but will protect others from your germs. Sinai Hospital had to move their masks behind the information desk because people were grabbing handfuls from the entrance, and they're keeping tabs on the coronavirus. "We've stepped up our hospital incident command center. This allows us to develop a coordinated communication plan and we're able to effectively communicate with all our hospitals, our outpatient and our ambulatory areas," said Martha Hill, Sinai's emergency preparedness coordinator.But on a daily basis, hospital staff are taking normal precautions for any respiratory illness, including face masks and eye protection. They also have a protocol and isolation rooms for any possible cases.  "First, we would identify those symptoms in the patient and then immediately, we would mask that patient and move them to an airborne isolation room," said Martha Wiberg said many viruses die off as the weather gets warmer, but since coronavirus is so new, doctors aren't sure that will happen.Johns Hopkins InvolvementJohns Hopkins is at the forefront of gathering data and information about coronavirus. Its scientists created an interactive map showing how the virus is spreading in real time.And they are also looking at how prepared the U.S. is for this international crisis.During a webinar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, experts said the U.S. is number one in five of six categories for preparedness. - prevention, early detection and reporting, rapid response and mitigation, sufficient and robust health system, and compliance with international norms. The study co-lead by Jennifer Nuzzo said the U.S. has work to do with respect to health care access."I fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent then that could create a bad situation where people either remain at home on in their community potentially infecting others," Nuzzo said.The scientists said it's also important to expand testing so we can know how much of the virus is out there, how long, and how quickly it's moving and with testing we will see a lot of new cases."Those new cases may expand very quickly. They were always there it's not that we are having an explosion the community. It's that we're finding the cases that are there," said Tara Sell, of Johns Hopkins.             BALTIMORE

A Maryland organization that makes burial gowns for babies has shifted its focus amid the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Anita Schatz, founder of Angel Gowns by Baba, now needs help in a different way. Schatz's Kingsville home is normally where tens of thousands of burial gowns are made from donated wedding and prom dresses.Schatz started the organization in 2008, but now things have changed. She has started sewing masks for health-care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus."I'm getting orders of 5,000-plus to start at one hospital," Schatz said.The masks are a polycotton blend with a slip on the side to insert a coffee filter. The straps are made of bias tape, so they don't wear down when washed."This design was given to me by a hospital, a large hospital. This is what they prefer us to make because it's the next best thing," she said.The next best thing has her overwhelmed. She said one volunteer can sew about 30 masks a day, but she needs more volunteers, monetary donations, bias tape and more polycotton blend fabric. She's also washing all donated fabric and there's a strict process when volunteers pick up materials."They put out there what they need, they pick it up, bring it back to me and then it goes into quarantine for however many hours it needs to be before I handle it and give it to the hospitals, because we are handling these things, once it gets to the hospitals they are going to sanitize them," Schatz said."When I was doing angel gowns, it was another story. It was a sad ministry. I dealt with death, the worst kind, babies, on a daily basis, but this is something different. We're trying to save lives," Schatz said.             KINGSVILLE, Md.

Small business loans could become target of fraud and a government watchdog is already trying to stop it
.W
The Inspector General's office released guidelines for consumers warning of ways the new loan program could be targeted for fraud.

As small businesses across the country clamor to apply for loans under the $2 trillion stimulus package, work is already being done to try and reduce any outbreak of fraud in the program.Behind the scenes, conversations have begun with law enforcement partners around the country to ensure that the Small Business Administration's expansion of loans is disbursed to the people intended to receive the funding, according to a spokesman from the Office of the Inspector General.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Monday that the small business loans included in the stimulus package amounting in nearly $350 billion would become available as soon as Friday. And, as he's pledged to get checks cut at "lightning speed," the Inspector General's office at SBA is working to try and educate consumers, lenders and law enforcement about what signs to look for to stamp out fraudsters.But the sheer volume of the money going out the door is a challenge. For an agency that gave out $28 billion in 2019, doling out $350 billion in a matter of months will be an unprecedented scale, especially given the tight timeline.The SBA will have an influx of tech support to help it streamline the loan process.

Business groups argue that need is only going to continue as stay-at-home orders continue throughout the country."There are very few who aren't feeling the impact," said Holly Wade, the director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business. "They are in desperate need of a cash infusion. The demand of these loans is huge. That will be the challenge in facilitating the massive demand."                        As small businesses across the country clamor to apply for loans under the $2 trillion stimulus package, work is already being done to try and reduce any outbreak of fraud in the program. Behind the scenes, conversations have begun with law enforcement partners around the country to ensure that the Small Business Administration's expansion of loans is disbursed to the people intended to receive the funding, according to a spokesman from the Office of the Inspector General.                              Advertisement                       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Monday that the small business loans included in the stimulus package amounting in nearly $350 billion would become available as soon as Friday. And, as he's pledged to get checks cut at "lightning speed," the Inspector General's office at SBA is working to try and educate consumers, lenders and law enforcement about what signs to look for to stamp out fraudsters. But the sheer volume of the money going out the door is a challenge. For an agency that gave out $28 billion in 2019, doling out $350 billion in a matter of months will be an unprecedented scale, especially given the tight timeline.                                                                                                       President Trump signs coronavirus stimulus package in hopes of curbing COVID-19’s economic impact                          The SBA will have an influx of tech support to help it streamline the loan process.

Major retailers have opened only 5 drive-thru testing locations, none available to general public

While these retailers have approximately 30,000 locations combined, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that there are only five locations from these major retailers that are currently offering drive-thru testing.

As President Donald Trump was facing intense criticism for a lack of adequate testing weeks ago, he announced in the Rose Garden in mid-March that the federal government would partner with private companies to set up drive-thru coronavirus testing sites.He invited chief executives from Target, Walgreens, Walmart and CVS to the microphone and showered them with praise over the new effort. The president told attendees he envisioned consumers driving up, getting swabbed and having their samples sent off to the lab to be tested — "without having to leave your car."But the president's celebrated announcement hasn't come close to being fulfilled.While these retailers have approximately 30,000 locations combined, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that there are only five locations from these major retailers that are currently offering drive-thru testing — and none are open to the general public.There is one drive-thru at a CVS in Massachusetts, three at two Walmarts and a Walgreens in the Chicago area and another at a Rite Aid in Philadelphia. Almost all of the locations are offering coronavirus testing only to first responders and health care workers, and some offer it only to those who fall under those categories and are showing symptoms.

After wrongly claiming days earlier that "anybody that wants a test can get a test," Trump was under intense scrutiny from lawmakers, state officials and health care providers who said there was a lack of adequate testing.Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration's response, also touted the effort. He said public-private partnerships like the ones with these major retailers had "laid the foundation" to help meet the nation's testing needs by giving a "little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive-by test."Initially, Walmart announced in a release that it was opening two drive-thru testing sites in the Chicago-area to serve first responders and health care workers who have potentially been exposed to COVID-19.

"We don't know where the next sites will be, but we are speaking with multiple states to see how we can play a role in supporting our communities at this unprecedented time."CVS's one drive-thru location is in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

Health and Human Services spokesperson Mia Heck said the federal government will "work with partners to make testing more accessible," although did not provide details on when."These private retailers ... have all opened drive-thru testing sites and know best how to meet their community's needs," Heck said.

'It takes me a minute to catch my breath': 17-year-old with coronavirus has warning for other teens
.W
The teen said she thought she had her usual springtime allergies until she started struggling to breathe.

A 17-year-old Iowa girl says young people like her need to be aware of the dangers of COVID-19.Pottawattamie County Public Health reported the 17-year-old has no pre-existing medical conditions and had contact with someone else who tested positive for coronavirus.In a phone interview, the anonymous teen told sister station KETV, "I didn't really think I would get it, but I knew it'd be a possibility."She said she thought she had her usual springtime allergies until she started struggling to breathe."When I couldn't really do much without getting winded, that's when I decided it was time to go to the hospital to get checked out," she said.She went to the emergency room Sunday and tested negative for other illnesses. She was given the COVID-19 test and received her results the next day."I was a little bit in shock. I think everyone was," she said. "Especially my mom, she's still pretty worried about me." The teen said she's worried for her mom, who has a weak immune system."It'd be very very bad if she got this, so I'm doing my best to stay away from her," she said.She works at a Westlake Ace Hardware in Council Bluffs, which is now temporarily closed. She was there last weekend on March 28 and 29.At the time, the store had already installed sneeze guards at the checkout stations, but she's still concerned for everyone she had contact with."If I knew that I'd been exposed to it, right when I had been exposed, whenever that may have been, I would have stayed at home right then and there," she said.She said right now, the virus feels like a combination of a cold, the flu and an elevated version of pneumonia."I'm having a little bit of problem with my coughing and breathing," she said. "I have a pretty bad coughing fit and it takes me a minute to catch my breath."The teen is confident she'll recover, but said she worries for those who are most at risk."Use hand sanitizer, wash your hands. Try not to go outside unless you absolutely need to," she said. The county health department is in communication with the Iowa Department of Public Health and is conducting a contact tracing investigation for this case. Health officials are considering the case a "low-risk exposure" to the public.             COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa

Costco, Home Depot limiting customers allowed in stores

To prevent further spread of the coronavirus, several stores have altered store hours, announced temperature checks for employees and reduced certain services.

To prevent further spread of the coronavirus, several stores have altered store hours, announced temperature checks for employees and reduced certain services. Now, at least two large retailers have announced policy changes related to the number of customers permitted in stores at one time to ensure social distancing. Effective Friday, Costco will allow no more than two people to enter its stores with each membership card. "This temporary change is for your safety and the safety of our employees and other members, and to further assist with our social distancing efforts," Costco's website says. Home Depot has also announced a new policy that will limit the number of customers inside at once. "We're also eliminating major spring promotions to avoid driving high levels of traffic to stores," Home Depot's website says. "In addition to training our associates on social distancing, we've placed distance markets at counters, posted signage throughout the stores and are making overhead announcements on our store PA systems asking customers to maintain safe distances." Home Depot has also announced measures to make sure their employees are healthy before reporting to work by distributing thermometers to associates in stores and distribution centers and asking them to perform health checks before starting shifts. Walmart announced earlier this week that its associates would be asked basic health questions before shifts and have their temperatures taken. Anyone with a temperature of 100 degrees will be paid for reporting to work and asked to go back home, according to a news release from Walmart. Those employees will not be able to return to work until they are fever-free for at least three days, the company said.

Carnival seeks $6 billion as impacts of coronavirus devastates cruise industry, announces more cancellations
.W
The cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months.

Carnival Corporation is seeking at least $6 billion to weather an unprecedented crisis that has decimated business, after coronavirus outbreaks aboard its cruise ships killed several passengers and sickened hundreds more.The cruise operator announced on Tuesday that it intends to raise $3 billion of secured notes and $1.75 billion of convertible notes — both due in three years — as well as $1.25 billion of new shares. Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a note on Tuesday that Carnival is suffering "a monthly cash burn of approximately $500 million" and the fresh injection of cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months.Shares in Carnival fell 2% in after-hours trading. The stock is down 74% for the year.On Wednesday, the cruise line announced additional cancellations.All Alaska sailings through June 30, all San Francisco sailings through the end of the year, all Carnival Radiance sailing up to Nov. 1 and all Carnival Legend sailings through Oct. 30 have been canceled.Carnival is the world's largest cruise operator. It runs flagship line Carnival Cruise, Costa Cruises, the Holland America Line and the Princess Cruises brand, whose fleet includes the Diamond Princess — a ship that became a floating quarantine zone off the coast of Yokohama in February.

Could plasma from recovered coronavirus patients help cure those who are sick, or even lead to a vaccine?

Could plasma from recovered coronavirus patients help cure those who are sick, or even lead to a vaccine?  It's a discussion becoming more and more popular as the world looks for a hopeful end to the pandemic of the novel coronavirus.President Donald Trump discussed the idea Sunday while addressing the press."And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well — meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus — and transfusing it into sick patients — sick patients, very — very, very powerfully."Mark Albert spoke to Dr. Jeffrey Gold form the University of Nebraska Medical Center to better understand how blood plasma works.Can plasma from recovered patients help others recover from the virus?"So there is very good data now that individuals who have developed antibodies," Gold said, "that is to say they've been infected with the coronavirus, can have their blood taken. They can be, what we call "pheresed," and that their plasma can be used to treat people who are infected. That was widely used during the time of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, 2015. And it was really quite effective. And I understand that there are at least thousands of instances now where individuals who have recovered from the coronavirus have been willing to donate their blood, have their plasma pheresed for purposes, not necessarily preventing the coronavirus, but of treating individuals who are quite ill."Can you get the virus donated from plasma?"I'm not aware of any demonstrated transmission through blood transfusion process," Gold said. "I wouldn't say that we won't read about the first anecdotal case tomorrow, but thus far it has not been something at least that I'm aware of."The FDA stressed there are "No FDA approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent" COVID-19.

The coronavirus has dealt a financial blow to millions of Americans and now April's bills are coming due. The good news is there is help available.

The coronavirus has dealt a financial blow to millions of Americans and now April's bills are coming due.The good news is there is help available. Reach out immediately to your mortgage lender, student loan servicer or utility provider to see what's available. Other assistance, such as stimulus checks or unemployment benefits, will take more time. The bottom line is that you need to take action to seek certain forms of relief.Here is help navigating the biggest issues:HOUSINGNumerous mortgage lenders have said they are willing to work with distressed borrowers, including potentially suspending or reducing payments. Contact them immediately to find out about your options.If you hold a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac — about half of all mortgage holders do — there is help. The mortgage buyers have suspended all foreclosures and evictions for homes owned by their companies. They've also expanded their forbearance program, which could suspend payments for up to a year. Ask the company you make your payments to if you hold a Fannie or Freddie loan.The federal government has also halted foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration.Renters' fate depends on where they live and who they rent from. Reach out to your landlord or property management company to ask for leniency. Several cities, such as Seattle, San Francisco and Boston, have halted evictions due to the coronavirus.UTILITIESGas, electric, and other utility providers often have assistance programs for customers who cannot pay in full. There are also government and charitable programs to help low-income or struggling households. Ask the utility provider for referrals or call 2-1-1 for help finding local social service programs or charities. Several cities and regions have opted to halt utility shutoffs.HEALTH INSURANCECOBRA allows laid off workers at large employers to pay to continue their health insurance coverage, but it can be prohibitively expensive. Being laid off also qualifies as a life event for most insurers, which means someone could get on a partner’s insurance outside of the normal open enrollment period.Due to the coronavirus, a handful of states have reopened their individual insurance exchanges to people who didn’t find coverage during the regular sign-up windows that started last fall. People who have lost coverage through their employer are allowed to shop on the exchanges outside the regular enrollment period.Some households may qualify for their state’s Medicaid program too.DEBTIf you are struggling to pay your credit card, auto loan or other debt, reach out to your lender. They've been instructed by federal regulators to work with borrowers impacted by the virus. Banks have said they are willing to make a variety of arrangements such as waiving fees, temporarily lowering interest rates or making other payment arrangements.STUDENT LOANSFederal loan borrowers can now seek an emergency administrative forbearance, which would allow them to postpone payments for up to 60 days. Borrowers must contact a servicer to apply.The federal government also lowered the interest rate on all federally held student loans to 0%. However, that will not lower the monthly payment; instead it will apply the payment entirely to the principle balance.The government has also temporarily halted collections and wage garnishment for borrowers who've fallen behind on their federal student loans. It has instructed private collection agencies to follow suit.If you have private student loans, contact your servicer for their repayment options.BUDGETIt's time to cut any non—essential expenses,. That means ending your gym membership and trimming phone or internet plans. Daycare or monthly commuting passes might be paused or lowered during unemployment.Consider extra work if you can to bring in income. If you still come up short, stay calm.“Companies are rolling out programs to help with missed or late payments," said Kristin Pugh, a certified financial planner. "If you can’t make a payment or can only make a partial payment you need to be proactive and reach out."FPA is offering free financial guidance to Americans in need. A nonprofit credit counseling agency can also provide low cost help managing debt and creating a household budget.If necessary, consider seeking aid for basic needs such as food and shelter. Or consider local food banks, which have more leniency in who they can help. United Way and 2-1-1 can also help you find social service support you may qualify for in your area.GOVERNMENT HELPYes, the government is delivering one-time payments to adults but those are still weeks away.Evelyn Zohlen, a certified financial planner and chair of the Financial Planning Association, urges people to use that money for needs not wants. If you are not in need, consider dropping that money into an emergency savings fund as anyone's economic picture can change quickly.If you are laid off or your income has been reduced, apply for unemployment as soon as possible.Congress is beefing up what states can offer — including allowing part-time, self-employed and gig economy workers who typically weren't covered to seek benefits. People who are quarantined, left work due to risk of exposure or to care for a family member can also apply.Applications can typically take two to three weeks to process, though the surge in applications could extend that time frame.

The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a shock to tens of millions of people in countries around the world: Suddenly, they can't buy the food they want, when they want it.

The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a shock to tens of millions of people in countries around the world: Suddenly, they can't buy the food they want, when they want it.Food supply chains in developed economies are showing increased signs of strain as lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus heap pressure on systems that had very little slack to begin with. The result is empty store shelves.The transportation links that move food around the globe are being tested in unprecedented ways. Shipowners are struggling to change crews and move goods between ports. Airlines have grounded thousands of planes, slashing air freight capacity.Travel restrictions also are clogging up road networks and making it difficult for farm workers to get where they are needed. And at the end of food supply chains, supermarkets that have come to rely on just-in-time deliveries have been upset by huge demand and panic buying.Global stocks of staple commodities such as wheat, corn and rice are at healthy levels, said Maximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. But logistics bottlenecks need to be identified and resolved quickly to ensure goods can get to where they are needed, and protectionist policies avoided, he added.Kazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, temporarily banned shipments of buckwheat, rye flour, sugar, carrots and potatoes earlier in March because the government was worried about domestic supply. While the restrictions have since been eased, similar moves by other countries could be problematic.The food supply crunch is getting attention from top policymakers: Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies last week pledged to resolve disruptions to global supply chains and ensure the movement of vital medical supplies, critical agricultural products and other goods and services across borders.Shipping on the front lineShipping would be a good place to start. The vast majority of the world's food supply is carried on ships, either in containers or on board bulk carriers.Yet shipowners, already reeling from shutdowns of some of the world's busiest ports in China, are now having to contend with sweeping lockdowns all over the world, hindering access to ports and making crew changes all but impossible due to travel restrictions.Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, recently said it had suspended all crew changes for a month partly to minimize the risk of vessels being quarantined by port authorities and causing disruptions to customers' cargo.But doing so puts the physical and mental health of seafarers at risk, as they remain on board ships for extended periods without a break, which could lead to crew shortages later on, the International Chamber of Shipping has warned.More than 30 ports worldwide are either restricting entry to vessels or prohibiting crew changes, including in Australia, Vietnam, India, Greece, Portugal, Chile and Argentina, according to Wilhelmsen, a maritime industry conglomerate based in Norway.Rules governing port access differ from country to country, and sometimes even within countries, making it very difficult for shipowners to plan routes, said Guy Platten, secretary general at the International Chamber of Shipping. This could snarl food supply chains, particularly for time-sensitive fresh produce, he added.Delays in transit from ports in China are likely to cause apple juice shortages in the United States, according to a March 13 report by commodities research firm Mintec. Two-thirds of the apple juice Americans drink comes from China.Air cargo restrictedThe shutdown in commercial aviation caused by coronavirus has sharply reduced air cargo capacity, making it harder and more expensive to move perishable goods that need to be delivered at speed."Passenger operations have been reduced so drastically that there is just not the capacity in the system to meet even the reduced levels of air cargo," Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement Tuesday.Shipments have been delayed as airlines struggle to arrange crews and get permission to fly because of travel restrictions, de Juniac said. "Last week the European Commission published guidance which will help clear roadblocks in Europe. And we encourage other countries to follow suit," he added.Hiten Dodhia, a director of Saturnalia UK, a company that imports high-value fresh produce from Africa and South America and sells it to supermarkets in Europe, said there has been a huge hike in the price of air freight due to the grounding of so many passenger planes.Lockdowns and curfews in countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala and Peru are restricting the movement of workers and causing labor shortages on farms, which will obstruct planting, harvesting and packaging, he told CNN Business.The biggest problems lie with vegetables that are planted, harvested and shipped over relatively short time frames, such as sugar snaps, baby corn, beans and broccoli, Dodhia said. He has told some farmers not to plant because it is unclear whether their goods can be moved to market in time.Labor and logisticsLabor shortages in Europe and the United States also threaten to seriously disrupt supply chains, push food prices higher and make certain high-value commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, hard to find.Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned that travel restrictions could prevent migrant workers from getting into the country for the upcoming harvest, while a nationwide shutdown will hamper growers' ability to recruit the 80,000 seasonal workers needed this year."We are urging the British people, university students, anyone looking for work, to mobilize behind British growers in this time of national importance and pick for Britain," the union's vice president, Tom Bradshaw, said in a statement.Labor shortages in Europe are meanwhile likely to interrupt Britain's supply of imported fruit and vegetables in the coming months, according to the UK's Landworkers' Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 small British farms and is a member of the international smallholder farmers' movement La Via Campesina. "Much of our produce comes from Southern Europe, where producers are already delaying and reducing spring plantings due to restrictions on movement of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, illness, transport restrictions and cashflow," it said in a statement.The price of apples from Poland and broccoli from Spain jumped by roughly 20% between February and March, as consumers hoarded fruit and vegetables, according to Mintec. "Traffic chaos at the German-Polish border has made transporting apples and other fruits problematic," said Mintec.Governments must resolve bottlenecks and ensure that perishable goods do not go to waste, said Torrero Cullen. Keeping labor-intensive packaging plants running at full capacity while still following social distancing guidelines will create an additional challenge, he added.No slack in the systemSupermarkets, which are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked amid panic buying, are facing logistics headaches of their own. And just-in-time supply chains mean there is very little slack in the system.Retailers generally hold between one to three weeks' worth of non-perishable items, such as pasta and rice, in stores and depots, with much lower quantities of fresh produce kept in storage, said Dave Howorth, executive director of Scala, an independent supply chain consultancy to the UK's food and drink sector."Suppliers generally deliver on a daily basis because there's so little stock in the system," he added. But if shipments are delayed because of restricted access to ports, or suppliers are held up at border crossings, daily deliveries may not be possible.Photos of empty shelves and steps taken by retailers to ration purchases suggest that while there may be plenty of food out there, the systems that get it to where it's needed are being stretched.This prompted the UK government to temporarily relax competition laws earlier in March to allow supermarkets to exchange data on stock levels, pool staff to meet demand, and share distribution depots and delivery vans.Another factor driving demand at supermarkets: restrictions imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus mean that people are eating more at home, instead of in restaurants."It's a fundamental change. You've seen a significant switch in volumes, which has been overlaid with panic buying," said Howorth. Over the four weeks to March 21, UK shoppers made three additional trips to the grocery store compared to the same period last year, spending an extra $2.4 billion, according to Nielsen. An additional 1.2 million online orders were placed over the same period, the research firm said.

CDC issues travel advisory for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut                          Hiten Dodhia, a director of Saturnalia UK, a company that imports high-value fresh produce from Africa and South America and sells it to supermarkets in Europe, said there has been a huge hike in the price of air freight due to the grounding of so many passenger planes. Lockdowns and curfews in countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala and Peru are restricting the movement of workers and causing labor shortages on farms, which will obstruct planting, harvesting and packaging, he told CNN Business. The biggest problems lie with vegetables that are planted, harvested and shipped over relatively short time frames, such as sugar snaps, baby corn, beans and broccoli, Dodhia said. He has told some farmers not to plant because it is unclear whether their goods can be moved to market in time. Labor and logistics Labor shortages in Europe and the United States also threaten to seriously disrupt supply chains, push food prices higher and make certain high-value commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, hard to find. Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned that travel restrictions could prevent migrant workers from getting into the country for the upcoming harvest, while a nationwide shutdown will hamper growers' ability to recruit the 80,000 seasonal workers needed this year. "We are urging the British people, university students, anyone looking for work, to mobilize behind British growers in this time of national importance and pick for Britain," the union's vice president, Tom Bradshaw, said in a statement. Labor shortages in Europe are meanwhile likely to interrupt Britain's supply of imported fruit and vegetables in the coming months, according to the UK's Landworkers' Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 small British farms and is a member of the international smallholder farmers' movement La Via Campesina. "Much of our produce comes from Southern Europe, where producers are already delaying and reducing spring plantings due to restrictions on movement of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, illness, transport restrictions and cashflow," it said in a statement. The price of apples from Poland and broccoli from Spain jumped by roughly 20% between February and March, as consumers hoarded fruit and vegetables, according to Mintec. "Traffic chaos at the German-Polish border has made transporting apples and other fruits problematic," said Mintec. Governments must resolve bottlenecks and ensure that perishable goods do not go to waste, said Torrero Cullen. Keeping labor-intensive packaging plants running at full capacity while still following social distancing guidelines will create an additional challenge, he added.                                                                                                       Food banks struggle as demand explodes thanks to coronavirus layoffs                          No slack in the system Supermarkets, which are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked amid panic buying, are facing logistics headaches of their own. And just-in-time supply chains mean there is very little slack in the system. Retailers generally hold between one to three weeks' worth of non-perishable items, such as pasta and rice, in stores and depots, with much lower quantities of fresh produce kept in storage, said Dave Howorth, executive director of Scala, an independent supply chain consultancy to the UK's food and drink sector. "Suppliers generally deliver on a daily basis because there's so little stock in the system," he added. But if shipments are delayed because of restricted access to ports, or suppliers are held up at border crossings, daily deliveries may not be possible.                                                                                                                           Some stores creating 'elderly hours' for seniors to get groceries, supplies before crowds                          Photos of empty shelves and steps taken by retailers to ration purchases suggest that while there may be plenty of food out there, the systems that get it to where it's needed are being stretched. This prompted the UK government to temporarily relax competition laws earlier in March to allow supermarkets to exchange data on stock levels, pool staff to meet demand, and share distribution depots and delivery vans. Another factor driving demand at supermarkets: restrictions imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus mean that people are eating more at home, instead of in restaurants. "It's a fundamental change. You've seen a significant switch in volumes, which has been overlaid with panic buying," said Howorth.  Over the four weeks to March 21, UK shoppers made three additional trips to the grocery store compared to the same period last year, spending an extra $2.4 billion, according to Nielsen. An additional 1.2 million online orders were placed over the same period, the research firm said.

N95 masks are in short supply — and scammers know it
.W
The saying goes: "A crisis is a terrible thing to waste." Scammers, seeing an opportunity amid coronavirus fears, are selling counterfeit masks.

The urgent and overwhelming demand for N95 masks has created fertile ground for scammers to start leaking counterfeits into the supply chain and to make fake deals for product that doesn't exist.Two leading N95 mask manufacturers have issued fraud warnings amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying they've received complaints about fraudsters trying to sell nonexistent product. And in one case, counterfeit masks have already made it to the front lines in the U.S.Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, received a batch of 1,000 N95 masks a few weeks ago from a trusted longtime vendor and determined they were fake."We have a policy of having our clinicians test a small sample of medical equipment like masks before we give it to our staff," said Jessica Griffin, the hospital's director of public relations. "These masks did not fit the face area properly," nor were they marked with a specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approval label as N95 masks are required to have.Related video above: Trump administration responds to supply shortagesIt was a shock for Holy Name, which is currently treating 144 patients for COVID-19 and has tested 1,440 people in total."We're the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in New Jersey," Griffin said. Maintaining a consistent supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) like gowns and N95 masks for its doctors and nurses is crucial as the hospital continues to see a steady stream of patients.But across the world, N95 masks are in short supply, as they're considered the gold standard of respirator masks. They're able to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles from the air, including bacteria and viruses — making them a crucial piece of equipment for doctors and nurses as they race to treat tens of thousands of coronavirus-infected patients in the United States.That degree of protection is guaranteed, however, only with federally tested and certified masks that fit snugly around the nose and mouth — creating a seal to minimize the number of particles that bypass the filter through gaps between the user's skin and the respirator, according to the CDC.Counterfeit respirators "can compromise the safety of anyone who uses them, including healthcare providers," the CDC told CNN Business.Fortunately for the providers at Holy Name, the hospital's testing procedures caught the counterfeit N95 masks, and they returned the batch to the vendor — who ultimately replaced them with 1,000 legitimate masks. Holy Name doesn't fault the vendor.But major N95 manufacturers and procurement companies are also sounding the alarm.Leading manufacturers flag scams3M, the world's leading manufacturer of N95 masks, has received reports from healthcare customers of people selling counterfeit 3M products and falsely claiming associations with the company, the firm said in a letter last week to Attorney General William Barr.It warned about products with "missing straps, strange odors, blocked valves, misspelled words, etc.," saying they are likely not authentic 3M respirators." In the letter, 3M CEO Mike Roman also said the company is working with large online sellers and the authorities to identify and remove counterfeiters.3M told CNN Business that while it hasn't seen a large influx of counterfeit respirators onto the market, it is tracking a bigger issue of fraudsters trying to collect money in exchange for masks they don't actually have.Prestige Ameritech, another top maker of N95 masks, has placed a "Fraud Alert warning" on its website saying its brand is also being used in "mask-selling scams." The company said it, too, is working with authorities on the matter. Prestige Ameritech did not respond to calls for further comment.Suspect solicitationsIt's not only manufacturers but also product sourcing firms who are dealing with potential N95 mask scams.Premier Inc. —  a North Carolina-based company that helps procure PPE for 4,000 hospitals and 175,000 non-acute providers like surgical centers — recently received a strange call.A person posing as a "broker" offered Premier 500 million masks, saying they had access to the sizable inventory, said Chaun Powell, group vice president with Premier. The company promptly called 3M, who told Premier it would be impossible for anyone to have that many masks immediately available.Meanwhile, scores of calls are pouring in. "Last week we received 10 to 20 solicitations from agents for millions of N95 masks. This week it's 70 calls," Powell said.Even as 3M and other makers ramp up production, Powell said immediate shortages have created opportunity for "questionable" mask products to seep into the supply chain."We have already seen masks enter the supply chain that fail to meet basic testing parameters," he said. He said Premier was aware of counterfeit N95 masks that showed the 3M logo incorrectly positioned on the packaging, for example."We have no interest in creating fear and doubt in the market, but we are focused on protecting the integrity of the supplies that our nation's dedicated caregivers and patients depend on," said Powell.Supply chain experts say they aren't surprised about fake masks popping up — and they expect the problem to accelerate."There's a high possibility of that because there's quite a lot of money to be made on these masks," said Rosemary Coates, executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit manufacturing research and consultancy group that advocates for bringing overseas jobs back to America. Coates has 30 years of expertise in supply chain management and counterfeit products.When a product becomes very popular in a short time period — as the N95 mask has — individuals emerge is who identify themselves as "agents" or "brokers" trying to score lucrative deals by selling counterfeits at a premium, Coates said.These middlemen might not even have any inventory initially, she added. "They try to make a deal first with businesses that are trying to procure legitimate product, like the N95 mask. After they get a deal they then try to source the counterfeit version of the product.""Anytime there is money to be made by selling products at a premium," she said, "counterfeiters will jump into the market."

A train engineer intentionally drove a speeding locomotive off a track at the Port of Los Angeles because he was suspicious about the presence of a Navy hospital ship docked there amid the coronavirus crisis, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The locomotive crashed through a series of barriers and fences before coming to rest more than 250 yards from the U.S. Navy Hospital Ship Mercy on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a release.Nobody was hurt. Eduardo Moreno, 44, was charged with one count of train wrecking, prosecutors said. It wasn't immediately known if he has an attorney. “You only get this chance once. The whole world is watching. I had to," Moreno told police, according to prosecutors. "People don’t know what’s going on here. Now they will.”The Mercy arrived in port this week to provide a thousand hospital beds to help regional medical centers expecting a surge of COVID-19 patients.             LOS ANGELES

FDA notes shortages of 2 drugs after they were touted by President Trump

The Food and Drug Administration says two drugs, which were promoted by President Trump in connection with COVID-19, now have shortages.

The FDA says it has shortages of two drugs that have gained a lot of attention in recent weeks. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug you've probably heard a lot about lately. President Donald Trump mentioned it as a possible treatment for COVID-19, even though doctors say there's no evidence it works on coronavirus patients. Now the Food and Drug Administration says there's a shortage of that drug and chloroquine.It posted that information on its drug shortages webpage. The FDA says there's a significant surge in demand, making it difficult for people who need the medication to get it. The drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.Manufacturers are now ramping up production.The federal agency is announcing this shortage just a couple of days after giving the green light to hospitals across the country to use the drug on coronavirus patients who are seriously ill, saying it's worth the risk to try it — despite the lack of clinical trials.

Coast Guard: Cruise ships must stay at sea with sick onboard
.W
The U.S. Coast Guard has directed cruise ships to prepare to treat any sick passengers and crew on board while being sequestered “indefinitely" offshore during the coronavirus outbreak.

The U.S. Coast Guard has directed cruise ships to prepare to treat any sick passengers and crew on board while being sequestered “indefinitely" offshore during the coronavirus pandemic.The new rules outlined in a memo are required for ships in the district that covers Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Puerto Rico. They also come with a stiff warning: Any foreign-flagged vessels “that loiter beyond U.S. territorial seas" should try first to medically evacuate the very sick to those countries instead.Many South Florida cruise ships are registered in the Bahamas, where hospital capacity is limited and people are still recovering from last year's devastating Hurricane Dorian.The rules, which apply to vessels carrying more than 50 people, were issued in a March 29 safety bulletin signed by Coast Guard Rear Admiral E.C. Jones, head of the seventh district. All ships destined for U.S. ports were already required to provide daily updates on their coronavirus caseload or face civil penalties or criminal prosecution.Dozens of cruise ships are either lined up at Port Miami and Port Everglades or waiting offshore due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most have only crew aboard, but Carnival Corp., which owns nine cruise lines with a total of 105 ships, notified the SEC on Tuesday that it has more than 6,000 passengers still at sea.Federal, state and local officials have been negotiating over whether Carnival's Holland America cruise ships, the Zaandam and Rotterdam, would be allowed to dock at Port Everglades this week. But the company's Coral Princess is coming, too, with what that ship's medical center called a higher-than-normal number of people with flu-like symptoms.Carnival said three of the 40 ships that were at sea when it paused its cruises last month are expected to arrive at port by week's end. In addition to the ships arriving in Fort Lauderdale, other ships are approaching Civitavecchia, Italy, and Southampton, England, spokesman Roger Frizzell said.Two of four deaths on the Zaandam were blamed on COVID-19 and nine people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Carnival's maritime chief officer William Burke told Broward County commissioners at a Tuesday meeting. The company said more than 200 have reported symptoms. More than 300 Americans, with about 50 Floridians, are on Zaandam and Rotterdam. Four children under 12 are on board.Gov. Ron DeSantis said he expected a resolution Wednesday after speaking with President Donald Trump, but port authorities later said discussions between the company and officials over the terms of docking were ongoing and they did not expect to update Broward County commissioners on Wednesday as foreseen at the Tuesday meeting.DeSantis maintained Florida's health care system is stretched too thin to take on the ships' coronavirus caseload, but he said he would accept the Florida residents on board.“My concern is simply that we have worked so hard to make sure we have adequate hospital beds,” he said.Trump had expressed sympathy toward the passengers on Tuesday.“They're dying on the ship,” Trump said. “I'm going to do what's right. Not only for us, but for humanity.”Passengers expressed their frustrations to The Associated Press on Wednesday.Andrea Anderson and her husband Rob coughed their way through a video chat from the Zandaam. Asked what she would say to Florida's governor, Anderson said, “How would he feel if his mother was on this ship? Would he still be saying, 'No they can't dock?'”Mary Beth Van Horn said she's “terrified” for her brother Tom Brazier, 77, of Ocean Park, Washington, who went on the South American cruise with his wife before he was supposed to begin a new bone cancer treatment in April. They weren't allowed to transfer to the Rotterdam with other apparently healthy people because they have portable CPAP machines and other mobility problems.“He is afraid. Last time, he told me 'I just don't see how this could end well,'" she said.For most people, the virus causes a fever and cough that can clear up in two to three weeks without hospitalization. Older adults and people with existing health problems are more likely to suffer severe illness and require oxygen to stay alive.Under normal conditions, a ship can call on the Coast Guard to medically evacuate people too sick to be cared for on board.Now a Coast Guard flight surgeon in the seventh district will decide if a transfer is absolutely necessary, but the cruise companies then would be responsible for arranging on-shore transportation and hospital beds.“This is necessary as shore-side medical facilities may reach full capacity and lose the ability to accept and effectively treat additional critically-ill patients," the memo said.

Maryland universities cancel study abroad programs amid coronavirus outbreak

Nine Towson University students studying abroad in Italy are being called back to the U.S. amid a coronavirus outbreak in that country.

Some local universities are taking steps to protect their students living abroad against the coronavirus threat by cancelling study abroad programs. Nine Towson University students studying abroad in Italy are being called back to the U.S. amid a coronavirus outbreak in that country."It's very scary," said student Nicci Bonner. "I definitely feel like it's the right move. It's just a whole scary situation. And even though study abroad is fun, I feel like safety is the most important right now."This is the first time the university has suspended a study abroad program."I think it isn't cool that students aren't able to go on their programs, but it's good that they could still be safe," said student Ramona Thomas.The nine students will not be allowed to return to campus immediately. They will have to self-quarantine away from the school. University officials said a decision hasn't been made yet regarding spring break, summer or fall study abroad programs."I'm sure that it's definitely possible that this could spread around at a faster pace. This has happened with other illnesses. But I'm personally not super worried about it because I feel like people do try to take precautions by making that they're not getting sick," Thomas said.The University of Maryland also cancelled its study abroad programs in Italy where the U.S. government has issued its strongest travel warning, advising Americans against going to two regions in the northern part of the country.Johns Hopkins University students studying in Bologna, Italy, have the option of remaining there, though some have already returned to the U.S. or are making plans to do so."Hopefully everything will be fine in a few years and everything can be back to normal," Bonner said.There is no immediate threat of the virus on campus.​             TOWSON, Md.

Biden campaign says it will arrange call with President Trump about coronavirus
.W
A phone call between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is in the works to discuss the coronavirus.

A phone call between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic contender for his position, is in the works to discuss the coronavirus pandemic."Our teams will be in touch and we will arrange a call," said Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, in a statement Wednesday evening.The potential steps toward a call come after Trump was asked about Biden's offer to speak with him at his daily coronavirus press briefing."I would absolutely take his call," Trump said. "I would love to speak with him, sure."The campaign had vaguely indicated willingness for a phone call earlier in the day, albeit with no concrete plan, after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, rebuked Biden for criticizing Trump's coronavirus response."I find it petty and partisan and completely unhelpful to the American population to have a former vice president, who was here for eight years, in his bunker in Wilmington just lobbing criticisms, reading from prepared notes and not that well," Conway said.Biden, for his part, has pushed back on any notion that his comments might politicize the pandemic, saying in a television interview, "Everything that I have done has been designed to be constructive."He added, "The best I can do from my position is to lay out what I think should be done, how to do it, and when it's not being done, say why the experts say, 'This is what we should be doing. Let's do it.' "The former vice president wrote an op-ed on Jan. 27 admonishing Trump as the "worst possible" leader to deal with the outbreak.Related video above: Biden urges Trump to use full federal authority"I am concerned that the Trump administration's shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later," Biden wrote at the time, when the United States had only a handful of confirmed coronavirus cases.He has since striven to remain a relevant voice in the national conversation as attention is focused on the virus by conducting television interviews and news briefings from a basement studio at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. His campaign has released several digital coronavirus-related ads, some directly criticizing Trump and another pitching Biden as an empathetic leader in an implicit contrast with the president.Biden told CNN Wednesday afternoon that the president needs to act like a wartime president during the struggle against the pandemic."The president said he's a wartime president. This is a war against this virus. He should act like a wartime president," the former vice president said.             CNN

Filing for unemployment benefits? Read this first
.W
It's not pretty out there — Americans have taken to social media to lambast their state unemployment agencies for crashing websites, error messages, endless hold times and busy signals.

Unemployment benefits are becoming a financial lifeline for millions of Americans after their employers shut their doors to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.The growing tsunami of layoffs has overwhelmed state unemployment systems as a record number of workers try to apply for benefits. The situation isn't likely to improve anytime soon.The bottleneck comes as Congress passed a historic expansion of jobless benefits — but applicants have to be able to file their first claims before the checks can start coming.The situation is so bad that governors have begun apologizing to frustrated people who can't file claims and have to wait longer for their money."Unemployment benefits are extremely essential to support workers who are trying to make ends meet and stay connected to the labor market," said Kali Grant, senior policy analyst at the Georgetown Center on Poverty & Inequality.Here's how unemployment benefits work:The rules vary by state, but typically employees have to have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, have a minimum level of prior earnings from recent employment, be ready to take new positions immediately and be actively seeking work. States can now waive the latter two requirements since hundreds of millions of Americans are staying at home, and many states have closed nonessential businesses.Just who is eligible for unemployment benefits also varies by state. Not all part-time workers qualify. And independent contractors and the self-employed typically don't either, though Congress has created a pandemic unemployment assistance program that temporarily covers them.How much you'll receive depends on your recent earnings and state in which you live, said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Benefits range from about $200 to $550 a week, on average, depending on the state, and typically replace about 40% of one's wages. But Congress just gave those weekly checks a big boost.It will likely take longer to file your initial claim and have it approved because of the crush of applications, but once that's done, your first payment typically arrives in your bank account in two or three weeks via direct deposit. You'll no longer have to wait a week for benefits to start, thanks to Congress.If you are found ineligible, you can appeal, though that process likely will also take longer these days.Here's what Congress just changed:In its recent stimulus package, Congress made several unprecedented changes to the unemployment insurance program.Jobless workers will soon get an extra $600 a week on top of their state benefits, for up to four months. That will significantly boost people's payments.Lawmakers also added up to 13 weeks of extended benefits, on top of state programs, which vary between up to 12 and 28 weeks.Plus, the new pandemic unemployment assistance program expands eligibility to those who are unemployed, partially unemployed or unable to work because of the virus and don't qualify for traditional benefits. This also includes independent contractors, the self-employed and gig economy workers. The pandemic program benefits mirror what's available in one's state.Congress also allowed states to relax some of the rules to make it easier to approve applications.The extended benefits and pandemic program end by Dec. 31.Here's what's happening when filers try to apply:Being able to actually file a claim, however, is another matter. It's not pretty out there — Americans have taken to social media to lambast their state unemployment agencies for crashing websites, error messages, endless hold times and busy signals.The chaos has prompted several governors, including Mike DeWine of Ohio and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, to take to Twitter in recent days to acknowledge the frustrations.Nils Warren has been trying to file an initial claim on Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity site for the past two days, but can't make it past the first few steps. The online system won't allow the audio engineer to reset his PIN, and he can't reach anyone on the hotline. He was told by the automated phone system Wednesday that he'd receive a call back within two hours. After more than six hours, the phone rang -- but then quickly disconnected."It just goes around and around," he said of the agency's site. "Or it kicks you off or you get an error message. It's like Groundhog Day but worse."The department, which has taken the system down for maintenance several times recently, apologized on Twitter Wednesday for the difficulty Floridians have had in submitting their claims.Warren, who saw all his jobs for convention centers, meetings and sporting events disappear by mid-March, is hoping the unemployment payments will help cover his utilities, groceries and mortgage bills so he doesn't have to drain his savings. He's not expecting to be booked again until the summer.Meanwhile, Texas' online system is so overloaded that the state Workforce Commission recommends people file in the middle of the night or very early in the morning. The agency's website notes that usage is lower between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged Tuesday the state system was not keeping up with the demand."I apologize for the pain. It must be infuriating to deal with," he said at a press conference.Last week, the state's Labor Department received more than 8.2 million calls, compared to 50,000 in a typical week. Its online filing system had 3.4 million visits, compared to 350,000 normally.The agency has dedicated 700 people to the unemployment insurance hotline and is training hundreds more. It has extended call center hours, added 20 additional servers to boost its website capacity and is processing applications on Sunday.The state is also asking people to file on certain days, based on the first letter of their last name.Still, even late at night, the agency's page warns it can take more than an hour to apply."The site is so deluged that it keeps crashing because you literally have hundreds of thousands of people at any time trying to get on the site," Cuomo said."It's compounding people's stress," he said. "You're unemployed, you're trying to get on some darn website. You can't get through the website."             CNN

Robert Kraft uses Patriots plane to get 1.2 million masks from China for health care workers

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is stepping in to help medical professionals who are caring for coronavirus patients.

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is stepping in to help medical professionals who are caring for coronavirus patients.A Patriots plane full of much-needed protective gear for health care workers is on its way to Massachusetts from China. The plane departed Shenzhen, China, just after 3:30 a.m. en route to Logan International Airport with 1.2 million N95 masks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It was only allowed to be on the ground for three hours as workers in masks and full-body suits loaded boxes onto the plane.Gov. Charlie Baker shared a photo of the plane early Thursday on Twitter, saying "No days off. Thanks to some serious teamwork, Massachusetts is set to receive over 1 million N95 masks for our front-line workers. Huge thanks to the Krafts and several dedicated partners for making this happen."Kraft is expected to join Baker to greet the plane when it arrives later Thursday in Boston.“As I said before, ordering vital equipment like this is only one part of the challenge and I am incredibly grateful that the Kraft's worked this issue relentlessly alongside our Command Center staff to get these critical supplies to Massachusetts," Baker said. The governor said the Krafts teamed with Ambassador Huang Ping, Dr. Jason Li, Gene Hartigan and the state's COVID-19 Command Center to make the mission possible. "Our administration will keep pursuing the PPE necessary to support our brave front-line workers who are working tirelessly to save lives during this pandemic," Baker said.The supplies will then be transported by the National Guard to a stockpile in Marlborough. The help comes after the governor has for weeks described attempts to order personal protective equipment, only to be outbid by the federal government and other countries.

How two funerals helped turn one small Georgia city into a hotspot for coronavirus
.W
When a retired janitor suddenly died in southern Georgia, crowds of relatives and friends flocked to a local funeral home and mourned together. Within weeks, their city was overrun by coronavirus cases.

When a retired janitor suddenly died in southern Georgia, crowds of relatives and friends flocked to a local funeral home and mourned together. Within weeks, their city was overrun by coronavirus cases.That cluster of coronavirus cases was linked to the funerals of 64-year-old Andrew J. Mitchell and another man, held in late February and early March, Dougherty County Council Chairman Chris Cohilas said. Albany, a city of roughly 75,000 people is the latest example of how the virus has started disrupting smaller, more rural areas as much as the country's larger, urban cities.As of Wednesday afternoon, there were at least 490 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Dougherty County and at least 29 coronavirus-related deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health said.About 20 people who attended at least one of the funerals contracted the virus, said Scott Steiner, the chief executive officer of Phoebe Putney Health System, which has its biggest hospital in Albany."It took one person, whoever that was, and there was no intent," Steiner told CNN. "It shows this virus can quickly spread."A spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Health acknowledged the virus spread among "individuals who attended a number of events in Albany" but said it's unclear "where or with whom it all started."'It was like a domino effect'Emell Murray discovered her long-time companion, Andrew J. Mitchell, unconscious in the living room of their home Feb. 24. The family said they suspect he had a heart attack and died.After his passing, their siblings, nephews, nieces and friends traveled to Albany to pay their respects at his funeral service, and later spent the afternoon at Murray and Mitchell's home.A couple of days later, Murray, 75, was hospitalized. She had a fever and her blood pressure skyrocketed."We didn't know what was wrong with her," Alice Bell, Murray's daughter, told CNN.Murray spent much of March at the hospital. In between visits, doctors informed her she had tested positive for coronavirus.But she wasn't the only one.Several of the couple's relatives contracted the virus, Bell said. The pastor who delivered Mitchell's eulogy, she said, has since died of coronavirus complications. Steiner, the hospital system CEO, confirmed that."It was like a domino effect," Bell said.The Martin Luther King Memorial Chapel LLC, which hosted the respective funerals on Feb. 29 and March 7, said health department officials notified them on March 13 about a potential exposure to the virus involving people who were present at the events."Although we have been identified as a common factor in the tracking of the COVID-19 in Albany, know that we are operating within all regulatory safety or health guidelines," the funeral home directors wrote in a Facebook post. "We know that there is growing concern across the city. We are taking extra precautions to protect you, our staff and the communities we serve."The funeral home did not respond to CNN's repeated attempts for comment.The cluster of cases began emerging shortly after a 67-year-old man tested positive for the virus. The man traveled from Atlanta to attend one of the funerals and was hospitalized in Albany during his trip, said Steiner, the hospital system's CEO."The next day it's when we began seeing people coming to our emergency room who were sick," Steiner said. "Two (people) the first day, six the next day, eight the next day, and it just began to cascade from that point."Some of those patients had attended the funerals, others were members of the same churches, Steiner said.Life changed quickly in AlbanyThe virus had been traveling through this close-knit community for several weeks by the time social distancing warnings came in.Before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines limiting gatherings to 50 people in mid-March, hundreds of runners flooded the city's streets for the Snickers marathon and half-marathon — one of the top 10 qualifiers for the Boston Marathon.They enjoyed live music during a downtown festival and packed the local churches on Sundays.As more people fell sick, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters that he was concerned about the growing number of cases in Albany."This situation cannot be more serious," Kemp said on March 19. "Stay home if you are sick. If there's any doubt, stay home. We've had this happen in many places around the state, with sick individuals attending funerals which has created one of the hot spots we have around the state. I think it's a good example we can all learn from."Local officials declared a state of emergency on the same day, banning community gatherings of more than 10 people after four coronavirus-related deaths were reported. A stay-at-home order followed a few days later.The state sent its national guard to helpThe epicenter of the pandemic for the coronavirus outbreak quickly changed from Washington to New York. As that happened, the virus' impact also became evident in Georgia.Georgia has at least 4,748 confirmed coronavirus cases, and at least 154 deaths in the state. The highest number of cases has been reported in Fulton County — which includes Atlanta, and has a population of about 1 million people. But Dougherty County — which has a population of about 85,000 people, and where Albany is — is a close second.Earlier this week, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, urged rural communities in the U.S. to prepare for the spread of COVID-19, "even though you think it's not there."Health care workers at Phoebe Putney Health System went through six months' worth of supplies in less than a week, Steiner said. Some health care workers are sleeping in their garages to protect their families and the intensive care units are quickly filling up.Kemp deployed Georgia National Guard medical teams to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, which has been the most inundated with patients. He's also deploying more than 100 Guard troops to long-term care facilities throughout the state that have seen coronavirus cases.He said Wednesday that Georgia hospitals might reach peak hospital capacity on April 23.For CaMia Hopson, an Albany state representative who lost a friend to coronavirus, life in the region feels like it will never be the same."We weathered tornadoes, hurricanes, everything ... but our entire world is dealing with something that we haven't seen in our lifetime," Hopson told CNN. "People are grieving, we are really hurting right now. We are not New York, but we are still impacted."             CNN

Police and fire departments warn supplies for first responders running dangerously low

Supply shortages are also plaguing first responders who are confronting the virus every day in the field — oftentimes before a patient even reaches the controlled environment of a hospital.

When a resident at an elder care facility near Madison, Wisconsin, refused to isolate Monday night after a coronavirus diagnosis, local law enforcement responded to the call for help. On the scene, a Dane County sheriff's deputy helped subdue the person and transport them to a local hospital. She was spat on in the process.The sheriff's deputy was lucky. Though she had to pause her shift to deep-clean her uniform with specialized equipment at a fire station, she had been covered head to toe in protective gear — gloves, goggles, a gown and a face mask separated her from the deadly virus that health officials say is spread through respiratory droplets.As the number of coronavirus cases continues to multiply across the country, supply shortages at hospitals have come into stark view. But similar shortages are also plaguing first responders who are confronting the virus every day in the field — oftentimes before a patient even reaches the controlled environment of a hospital.Cities and towns big and small, which employ most of the country's police officers, firefighters and EMTs, are turning to unofficial sources as they struggle to procure personal protective equipment and other supplies, like hand sanitizer, and compete for scarce federal resources."I haven't heard from a place in the United States that they've got an adequate supply of personal protective equipment at every level. Everyone we've heard from has been short or out," said Jim Pasco, the executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Many cities are looking to the federal government and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for supplies — but have often found a lengthy wait and a cumbersome process before supplies trickle down to them, particularly in locations that aren't in one of the country's coronavirus hotspots.The U.S. Conference of Mayors conducted a survey of cities last week that starkly illustrated the problem for cities: 91% of cities that responded said they did not have an adequate supply of face masks, 88% lacked sufficient personal protective equipment and 62% said they had yet to receive emergency supplies from their state. Much of that equipment would be sent into the field for first responders.During past national emergencies, such as major hurricanes, earthquakes or wildfires, assistance would pour into cities from across the country, addressing any shortages, local officials said. But that's just not an option in the global coronavirus pandemic, where states are now bidding against one another — and the federal government — for critical supplies."Nobody has enough of anything, nor do I think any help is on the way," said Wade Kapszukiewicz, the mayor of Toledo, Ohio. "It is our sense we are really left to fend for ourselves in a lot of ways."Police seeking supplies elsewherePolice and fire departments across the country are scrambling.One Connecticut town's police department is turning to a supply of expired Army surplus masks for their officers. A rural Washington state county fire department set up a collection box for donations of gloves, masks and other items. Sheriff's deputies working at a northern Wisconsin jail wear bandanas to cover their faces when dealing with inmates. And across the country, distilleries and breweries are turning from producing alcohol to hand sanitizer to keep local departments stocked up.In New York City, where the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the U.S. has translated to more than 1,400 sickened NYPD employees, a wave of supplies bought from a private company by the New York City Police Foundation with donated funds is on its way to bolster the country's biggest police force.Shipments of 150,000 masks, 150,000 gloves and 150,000 packets of hand sanitizers for frontline officers are expected in the coming days."This equipment will help keep our officers physically safe. But beyond that, it sends them a clear message — that their unwavering commitment to protecting people is deeply appreciated," NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said.For smaller forces across the country, national police associations have played a key role. Groups like the National Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association have leveraged relationships in Washington to sound the alarm about the protective equipment shortages.Pasco, with the National Fraternal Order of Police, said that the White House has been especially helpful in making connections between the law enforcement group and public health officials at the Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Still, limited national stockpiles of protective equipment has meant law enforcement is competing with medical professionals for federal prioritization."There have been promises both at the federal level, as high as the president, and at the state level, that first responders will be a priority, but we're talking weeks until that equipment can be made available," said Dane County, Wisconsin, Sheriff Dave Mahoney, the incoming president of the National Sheriffs Association."We can't neglect our first responders by providing all of our resources to the medical field. Oftentimes it is our first responders — our police officers and deputy sheriffs and paramedics and our firefighters — who are having the first contact with individuals who are suffering with the symptoms of COVID-19," Mahoney said.From booze to hand sanitizerU.S. Conference of Mayors President Bryan Barnett, the mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, said in an interview that the mayors' survey released last week came at a critical time to show the federal government how many cities were lacking supplies, in addition to the shortages that hospitals are facing.Barnett said he was hopeful that the number of cities in need of supplies would decrease in the coming weeks, but the U.S. Conference of Mayors is also pushing for the White House to embrace the Defense Production Act to ramp up supplies, sending a letter Monday urging for "full enforcement" of the law.In the interim, states are turning to local businesses, donations and any other means necessary to keep their supply shelves stocked.One particular challenge for cities has been hand sanitizer, a product that's been difficult to come by for hospitals, first responders and the general public. Cities have gotten creative to get their share of sanitizer — and the most popular source seems to be the alcohol industry.In Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer said the state's bourbon makers have turned to producing sanitizer, helping keep his city supplied.A local distillery filled an order for 1,000 gallons of hand sanitizer for Dayton, Ohio, delivering the product to first responders and frontline workers, said Mayor Nan Whaley. Toledo has been getting sanitizer from both a distillery and a brewery.In Santa Clara, California, the first coronavirus hotspot in the Golden State, the city has needed to prioritize giving sanitizer to its employees in the field over those with access to soap and water, according to the city's emergency services manager, Lisa Schoenthal. But she said the city was close to securing a contract to replenish its sanitizer stock — coming from a local distillery."It's the number one request we get," Kapszukiewicz, the Toledo mayor, said of requests from his first responders.Supplies from locals — or ChinaAlcohol producers transitioning from liquor to sanitizer is just one of the ways that cities have been able to get their workers the supplies they need.Carol Dutra-Vernaci, the mayor of Union City, California, said donations have helped them maintain their supply stockpile. One business donated N95 respirators to local law enforcement. A janitor supply company in the city gave a couple boxes of gloves.Even the sister cities program between the United States and China played a role: Union City's sister city, Liyang, China, donated 6,000 masks that arrived this week, now that the pandemic is subsiding in China. Dutra-Vernaci said she's asking if Liyang can spare even more.In Windham, Connecticut, the police department is planning to use a supply of expired Army surplus masks, said the town's public information officer, Matt Vertefuille. The fire department bought machines with ultraviolet light to sanitize equipment and trucks, he said."We are also scrambling, trying to find space for our first responders and town employees who either get exposed or infected and don't want to take it home," he said.Some cities are in better shape than others when it comes to supplies. Jersey City, New Jersey, Mayor Steven Fulop said his city currently has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer because it stocked up early when the first cases began appearing outside of China."We got our stuff in January. That has made a huge difference for where we are today, being able to provide resources to other entities that need it," Fulop said, adding that the city has provided some of its supplies to local hospitals. "If we didn't have that, we'd be in a very different place."While the federal government says it's ramping up its supply chain, many local officials said receiving those supplies can be cumbersome. While every state has a different system, cities generally have a two-step process before they receive supplies: Cities typically funnel up their requests to the state, often through counties, and then the state decides where the supplies it receives from the federal government should go.With many states receiving only a fraction of the requests for supplies through the Strategic National Stockpile, the requests from many cities are going unanswered."The state tries to deliver what they have, but they don't have what they need either," Whaley said.The supplies problem is lurking particularly in areas where the pandemic has not had a big impact.Noel Hardin, a fire chief in Asotin County, Washington, near the Idaho border, said his rural county is one of the few in Washington state that hasn't had a coronavirus case — yet. As a result, they haven't received supplies from the state, which has only been able to fill a portion of requests from counties for federal equipment.His department asked the public for donations of extra items like gloves and masks, he said, setting up a drop-off point for items. He's not facing a shortage yet — but he's most concerned about needing masks and gowns should cases begin to emerge in the county."If we were to get hit with a bunch of cases all at once," Hardin said, "we'd be hurting."

A Facebook group matches RVs sitting idle with health care workers who need a place to isolate
.W
The Facebook group has already racked up nearly 3,000 members, an incredible number given the fact that the group was created just one week ago.

For Mark Quale, an emergency room physician in Burlington, North Carolina, coming home after a long day at the hospital was as stressful as work itself. With two young boys, a wife and elderly mother-in-law at home, he knew that if he wasn't cautious, he could spread the novel coronavirus to his own family.So just as he arrived home from work, he would strip off his scrubs on the front porch, walk the specific route to his bathroom that was cordoned off by a tarp and wash all the germs off in the shower.But today, Quale's mind is more at peace because he's able to isolate himself in a 31-foot travel trailer, and it's all thanks to a Facebook group called RVs 4 MDs, which matches health care workers to local RV owners.It started with a Facebook postFrom an ICU nurse in Twin Cities, Minnesota, to an ER doctor in Lynchburg, Virginia, RVs 4 MDs has matched dozens of health care workers with RVs, trailers and campers in their area. The Facebook group has already racked up nearly 3,000 members, an incredible number given the fact that the group was created just one week ago.Last Monday, Emily Phillips, a mother of three from Celina, Texas, had posted on her Facebook asking if anybody had an RV her family could borrow as her husband was an ER doctor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A woman named Holly Haggard replied saying that Phillips could borrow hers."Before the RV, I was a nervous wreck. Every time my husband walked in the door or put his hand on something, I thought we were going to get (COVID-19), including my baby," Phillips said. "But now that he's in that RV, I'm back to my life, focused on my full-time job and my kids, and it's completely changed our situation."Knowing that there were countless other families in similar situations as hers, Phillips took on Haggard as her business partner and the two created RVs 4 MDs, which went live last Tuesday night.In a matter of one week, the two Texan moms have built the simple Facebook group into a robust volunteer organization, complete with a board of directors and network of volunteers spanning across the nation.Kindness from complete strangersQuale and his family were one of the first to be matched with an RV from a pair of kind strangers named Kelsey and Tim Webb. The two families had never met before, but Tim drove his trailer for 2.5 hours to Quale's home, gave Quale's wife, LaRayne, the keys and told her that they could use it for as long as they needed."It was such an emotional thing to go through and to have someone offer up their RV completely for free, I felt so blessed," LaRayne, who now volunteers with RVs 4 MDs said. "I asked if they wanted us to cover the insurance, but they wanted nothing... They said that they are praying for us and rooting for us."Kelsey, who normally makes money by renting out the trailer, said donating it to the Quales was a "no-brainer.""This family was in need and this was the one way we could help," Kelsey told CNN. "You can't put a price tag on this... It just makes my heart happy that we're able to do this for them and give them peace of mind."Quale said he was extremely proud of his fellow health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic, but he added that this virus isn't something that can be defeated by the medical professionals alone."(RVs 4 MDs) demonstrates that there is so much more to fighting the coronavirus than what happens at the hospital. There are layers upon layers of people fighting this in different ways. The reason I'm able to fight this right now is because of my wife and the work that these people are doing so we can focus on the medical portion and not have to worry about the rest," Quale said.Others joining inDr. Tiffany Osborn said she’s taking an extreme precaution to keep her family protected from COVID-19.“We decided the best course of action was for me to isolate myself from them once I started working in the emergency department,” said Dr. Osborn. She, like many St. Louis doctors, is on the front line combating COVID-19.“I work in both groups, the emergency department and the ICU on a regular basis," she said.The Washington University doctor and her husband decided to shift money planned for a home extension toward buying a camper.“So our extension is now the camper that I’m living in,” Osborn said.Hear more of Osborn's story in the video above. She said when she gets home from work, she goes directly to her camper to clean and sanitize before coming outside to sit on the camper steps to speak to her family.KMOV in St. Louis reported that local hospitals are stepping in to keep medical professional families safe from COVID-19.Barnes-Jewish Hospital is working to offer alternative housing for healthcare workers. SLU Hospital is offering housing in one of their dorms for medical professionals to rest and recuperate after a long day.“It was one of those things where we don’t have enough information to feel completely safe and we just want to make sure the family was protected,” Osborn said.More volunteers are neededEvery hour, there are new posts on the Facebook page from spouses and family members looking to be matched with an RV."Looking for an RV in Grapevine Texas. Wife is camping out on the apt patio," one post reads."ER Doc in Rochester, New York has been living in the garage for 3 weeks to protect our 3 kids and me," another post reads.But with each new request, there's an equal amount of posts from RV owners saying that they want to help."I have never seen anything like this in my entire life," Phillips said. "The amount of people that are stepping up to help with a project where they aren't even getting a dime in return is unbelievable."To keep up with this project that has spread like wildfire, Phillips has recruited the help of attorneys, people in insurance and IT, but what she needs the most right now are more volunteers, she said."We need more volunteers to head up the different states," Phillips said. "A lot of people are out there with nothing to do. Well, we got something to do and it can really help a lot."Phillips and her team hope to expand the program into Canada, set up an official website, and even keep it going after the coronavirus crisis is over."We're going to keep it running until there's not one person left on the planet that needs an RV or needs shelter," Phillips said. "Whether it's a storm or whatever the case is, we'll have this organization for the next crisis because there's always going to be a need for shelter."             CNN

Officials reverse decision, say social security recipients will automatically receive stimulus check
.W
Social Security recipients will not have to file a tax return to receive a stimulus check, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday.

Social Security recipients will not have to file a tax return to receive a stimulus check, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday.The Washington Post reports that the Internal Revenue Service originally said to qualify for a payment, you would need to file some sort of tax return."The IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments to Social Security recipients who did not file tax returns in 2018 or 2019," the Treasury Department said in a press release. The reversal comes after lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to send Social Security recipients their payments automatically, according to CNN."Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return need to take no action, and will receive their payment directly to their bank account," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  President Trump signed the historic $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package last month in hopes of curbing the economic impact of COVID-19.Individuals who do not receive their Social Security beneficiaries through direct deposit, will receive a check, the Treasury Department said in its press release.

7-week-old baby in Connecticut diagnosed with coronavirus dies

The baby's cause of death is still being determined.

A 7-week-old baby who died at a hospital in the Hartford area had the coronavirus, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday. The cause of death is unknown.The unidentified child from Hartford was unresponsive when taken to the hospital recently and could not be revived. The infant tested positive during a postmortem exam for the virus that causes COVID-19, said Josh Geballe, the governor's chief operating officer. Dr. James Gill, the state's chief medical examiner, said the infant had no other known medical conditions. An autopsy has been done but more tests are needed before a cause of death can be determined, he said."That baby was less than 7 weeks old. And just a reminder that nobody is safe with this virus," Lamont said at a news conference after touring a temporary hospital set up at Southern Connecticut State University.Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide.An infant in Chicago died Saturday who tested positive for coronavirus, but that baby's cause of death also had not been determined, according to reports.Related video: 4-year-old girl is Milwaukee County's youngest coronavirus patientA letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers last month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure and died four weeks after being hospitalized.Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year-old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.             HARTFORD, Conn.

Dozens of spring breakers from Texas boarded a plane for fun and came home with coronavirus.

If you were thinking of riding out the coronavirus outbreak in sunny Hawaii, think again: Anyone traveling between the state's islands must quarantine themselves for two weeks.And breaking that quarantine order to gulp some fresh air could earn you a hefty fine — or a prison sentence.Hawaii Gov. David Ige signed a proclamation on Monday that requires residents and visitors who travel between islands to quarantine themselves for 14 days.Anyone who violates the mandatory quarantine could face up to $5,000 in fines or a year in prison, if convicted.In this case, quarantined people cannot leave their hotel rooms or receive visitors. People traveling for health care aren't required to quarantine themselves, though they must follow the social distancing measures laid out in a previous supplementary proclamation."The dangers of COVID-19 require the serious attention, effort, and sacrifice of all people in the State to avert unmanageable strains on our healthcare system and other catastrophic impacts on the State," the recent proclamation read.Violating social distancing is an arrestable offenseFor weeks, public health officials have pleaded with the American public to stay home to prevent new coronavirus cases.Several states are taking that seriously, and now, violating social distancing orders is an arrestable offense.In Florida, a megachurch pastor was arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and a violation of health emergency rules for holding services for hundreds of churchgoers.

Almost $30 million in drugs seized in nearly half-mile-long tunnel linking US and Mexico

The three-foot-wide tunnel has reinforced walls, ventilation, lighting and a rail system, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Federal agents in San Diego seized about 4,400 pounds of drugs from a sophisticated smuggling tunnel that stretched into Tijuana, Mexico, authorities in California announced Tuesday.The three-foot-wide tunnel is more than 2,000 feet long and has reinforced walls, ventilation, lighting and a rail system, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It had an average depth of 31 feet.The tunnel linked a warehouse in the Otay Mesa section of San Diego to another in Tijuana.Authorities found 1,300 pounds of cocaine, 86 pounds of methamphetamine, 17 pounds of heroin, 3,000 pounds of marijuana and more than two pounds of fentanyl in the tunnel, according to the statement. The drugs have a street value of $29.6 million."These tunnels show the determination of drug trafficking organizations to subvert our border controls and smuggle deadly drugs into our community. But these recent tunnel seizures also show the dedication of our amazing partners on the San Diego Tunnel Task Force to locate and shut down these tunnels to keep our communities safe," Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in Charge John W. Callery said in a statement."Despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, DEA employees continue to work tirelessly to serve and protect the community."Agents estimated that the tunnel had been in use for several months, the statement said.It was discovered March 19 after an investigation by the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, which includes the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Border Patrol, the DEA and the United States Attorney's Office.

Federal officials distribute more than 500,000 medical supplies confiscated from price gougers
.W
Officials say the supplies found include N95 masks, medical grade gloves, surgical gowns and disinfectant towels, among other items.

Federal officials announced Thursday they are distributing more than 500,000  hoarded medical supplies to those fighting on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak. The Department of Justice said in a press release it partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute the supplies, which includes about 192,000 N95 respirator masks."The FBI discovered the supplies during an enforcement operation by the Department of Justice's COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force on March 30 and alerted HHS which used its authority under Defense Production Act (DPA) to order that the supplies be immediately furnished to the United States," the DOJ said in its press release.Officials say other supplies found include, medical grade gloves, surgical masks, procedure masks, N100 masks, surgical gowns, disinfectant towels, particulate filters, bottles of hand sanitizer and bottles of spray disinfectant."HHS will pay the owner of the hoarded equipment pre-COVID-19 fair market value for the supplies," the DOJ said in its announcement."If you are amassing critical medical equipment for the purpose of selling it at exorbitant prices, you can expect a knock at your door," said Attorney General William P. Barr.  "The Department of Justice's COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force is working tirelessly around the clock with all our law enforcement partners to ensure that bad actors cannot illicitly profit from the COVID-19 pandemic facing our nation."The personal protective equipment is for health care workers in New York and New Jersey, the Department of Justice said. "Cracking down on the hoarding of vital supplies allows us to distribute this material to the heroic healthcare workers on the frontlines who are most in need," said HHS Secretary Alex Azar.The DOJ says those interested in selling personal protective equipment to the federal government should contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency."This is the first of many such investigations that are underway," said Peter Navarro, DPA Policy Coordinator and Assistant to the president.  "Our FBI agents and other law enforcement agencies are tracking down every tip and lead they get, and are devoting massive federal resources to this effort.  All individuals and companies hoarding any of these critical supplies, or selling them at well above market prices, are hereby warned they should turn them over to local authorities or the federal government now or risk prompt seizure by the federal government."

Memo: Some in US may not get stimulus checks until August
.W
The federal government expects to begin making payments to millions of Americans under the new stimulus law in mid-April, but some people without direct deposit information may not get checks until mid-August or later.

The federal government expects to begin making payments to millions of Americans under the new stimulus law in mid-April, but some people without direct deposit information may not get checks until mid-August or later, according to a memo obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.The document from the House Ways and Means Committee says the IRS will make about 60 million payments to Americans through direct deposit in mid-April, likely the week of April 13. The IRS has direct deposit information for these individuals from their 2018 or 2019 tax returns.Then, starting the week of May 4, the IRS will begin issuing paper checks to individuals, the memo says. The paper checks will be issued at a rate of about 5 million per week, which means it could take up to 20 weeks to get all the checks out. That timeline would delay some checks until the week of Aug. 17.But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rebuffed concerns raised that it may take months for some people to receive their money. Those concerns relate to people who might not have direct deposit information on file from a recent tax filing.Mnuchin said if the government doesn’t have someone's information, there will be a simple web portal. If that doesn’t work, they’ll send it by mail. He suggested it would take weeks, not months.The staff memo said the timeline was based on "extensive conversations with the IRS and the Department of Treasury.'' The timeline is subject to change, given ongoing discussions between Congress and the Trump administration."The Committee remains focused on ensuring all eligible Americans receive their payment as quickly as possible,'' the memo says.The payments are part of the $2.2 trillion rescue package signed into law last week by President Donald Trump aimed at combating the economic ravages of the coronavirus outbreak.Most people don’t need to do anything to get the money.Reversing an earlier position, the government said this week that Social Security recipients who are not required to file a tax return will not need to file a very simplified tax return to receive their government stimulus check. The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate the $1,200 checks to Social Security recipients who did not file tax returns in 2018 or 2019.The checks will be issued in reverse order of adjusted gross income, meaning that people with the lowest income will get payments first.The committee estimates that there are 150 million to 170 million U.S. taxpayers, which leaves 90 million to 110 million taxpayers who are either filers or nonfilers but about whom the IRS wants information.The filers will need to receive a paper check unless their direct deposit information can be updated in the IRS portal. Nonfilers may need to file the simple tax return and likely include direct deposit information if they want to receive their rebates quickly. The IRS is encouraging taxpayers to file their 2019 returns as soon as possible.The IRS expects to create a portal in late April or early May that will allow taxpayers to find out the status of their rebate payment and update direct deposit information, the memo says.Anyone earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income and who has a Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. That means married couples filing joint returns will receive the full payment — $2,400 — if their adjusted gross income, which is what they report on their taxes, is under $150,000.The payment steadily declines for those who make more. Those earning more than $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers, are not eligible. The thresholds are slightly different for those who file as a head of household.Parents will also receive $500 for each qualifying child.Hearst TV contributed to this report.             WASHINGTON

Three men stole 600 toilet paper rolls in Hong Kong amid fears of virus-driven shortages
.W
Likely caused by worry over the virus currently gripping China, three men collectively stole about 600 toilet paper rolls to use in case of a shortage.

Police in Hong Kong have arrested two men and are searching for a third after the group stole about 600 toilet paper rolls, in a robbery likely sparked by coronavirus fears that have gripped the city.Early Monday morning, a delivery worker was transporting goods to a supermarket in the city's Mong Kok district. He had placed about 50 packs of toilet rolls, containing a total of about 600 rolls, outside the supermarket when three men stole them, a police spokesperson told CNN.Several hours later, the police found the stolen toilet rolls in a nearby guesthouse, and arrested two of the men. They are investigating the incident as a robbery, and are still looking for the third suspect. No additional identifying information for the three men is available at this stage.The robbery comes amid heightened fears of supply shortages in Hong Kong as the novel coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. The coronavirus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected more than 71,000 people globally, with 57 confirmed cases in Hong Kong. One person has died of the virus in the city -- marking one of only five deaths that have taken place outside mainland China.Earlier this month, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, the Hong Kong government announced it would close some borders with mainland China -- sparking unsubstantiated rumors that supply chains from China would be cut off. Residents rushed to supermarkets to load up on supposedly endangered goods such as toilet paper rolls, rice, hand sanitizer, and other cleaning products.The city government urged residents not to panic buy, trying to reassure the public that the supply chain would not be cut off -- but to no avail. Videos online show crowds of people at supermarkets across the city wildly jostling for  toilet paper rolls.Soon, supermarkets sold out entirely of toilet rolls, food staples, and other crucial goods; photos inside supermarkets showed barren shelves and empty aisles.The toilet roll crisis sparked controversy in Hong Kong. After photos circulated on social media of residents hoarding multiple packs, some accused the panic buyers of unnecessarily creating chaos and confusion.Gilly Wong, the head of Hong Kong's Consumer Council, told public broadcaster RTHK the panic buying had caused price hikes in toilet rolls and the loss of discounted offers.The government also condemned "rumor mongers with evil intentions" who had sparked the panic. Government measures against the coronavirus outbreak, like travel restrictions and border closures, "will not affect the freight services between the mainland and Hong Kong," it said in a statement."There is no need for the public to worry," it added.CNN spoke with two major Hong Kong supermarkets, two shipping companies, and two container operators -- all of which said their supplies of food and other daily products were fine. Wellcome, a major supermarket chain, said any rumors of supply shortages are unfounded.To prevent further panic buying, Wellcome -- along with other supermarkets -- have implemented limits on how many units of an item shoppers can buy at a time. For example, shoppers can only buy two units of rice, toilet rolls, antiseptic wipes, hand soap, and canned meat.

14 passengers on US charter flights evacuating quarantined cruise ship test positive for coronavirus
.W
The State Department said 14 of the evacuees received confirmation they had the virus but were allowed to board the flight because they did not have symptoms.

Two charter flights carrying cruise ship passengers from Japan landed at military bases in California and Texas overnight, starting the clock on a quarantine period to ensure passengers don't have  the new virus  that's been spreading in Asia.A plane carrying American passengers touched down at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California just before 11:30 p.m. Sunday, local time. A second flight arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas around 2 1/2 hours later, early Monday.Japan's Defense Minister Taro Kono had tweeted earlier that Japanese troops helped transport 340 U.S. passengers on 14 buses from Yokohama port to Tokyo's Haneda airport. About 380 Americans were on the cruise ship. The U.S. said it arranged the evacuation because people on the Diamond Princess were at a high risk of exposure to the virus. For the departing Americans, the evacuation cuts short a 14-day quarantine that began aboard the cruise ship Feb. 5.The State Department announced later that 14 of the evacuees received confirmation they had the virus but were allowed to board the flight because they did not have symptoms. They were being isolated separately from other passengers on the flight, the U.S. State and Health and Human Services said in a joint statement. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday that an infected person who shows minimal symptoms could still pass the virus to someone else. After arriving in the U.S., all of the passengers must go through another 14 days of quarantine at the military facilities — meaning they will have been under quarantine for a total of nearly four weeks. Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and Italy were planning similar flights of passengers. Other governments, including Canada and Hong Kong, also will require the passengers to undergo a second 14-day quarantine.Japan on Monday announced another 99 infections  on the Diamond Princess, raising the ship's total number of cases to 454. Overall, Japan has 419 confirmed cases of the virus, including one death. The United States has confirmed 15 cases within the country. Separately, one U.S. citizen died in China.Americans Cheryl and Paul Molesky, a couple from Syracuse, New York, opted to trade one coronavirus quarantine for another, leaving the cruise ship to fly back to the U.S.Cheryl Molesky said the rising number of patients on the ship factored into the decision."We are glad to be going home," Cheryl Molesky earlier told NHK TV in Japan. "It's just a little bit disappointing that we'll have to go through quarantine again, and we will probably not be as comfortable as the Diamond Princess, possibly."She sent The Associated Press a video of her and her husband boarding the plane with other Americans."Well, we're exhausted, but we're on the plane and that's a good feeling. Pretty miserable wearing these masks though, and everybody had to go to the bathroom on the bus," she said.Some American passengers said they would pass up the opportunity to fly to the United States because of the additional quarantine. There also was worry about being on a long flight with other passengers who may be infected or in an incubation period.One of the Americans, Matthew Smith, said in a tweet Sunday that he saw a passenger with no face mask talking at close quarters with another passenger. He said he and his wife scurried away. "If there are secondary infections on board, this is why," he said. "And you wanted me to get on a bus with her?"He said the American health officials who visited their room was apparently surprised that the couple had decided to stay, and wished them luck."Thanks, but we're fine," Smith said he told them.

Children's coronavirus cases are not as severe, but that doesn't make them less serious
.W
Children are catching the coronavirus, but they're generally developing mild cases of the illness.

Germs spread easily among children. So as the coronavirus spreads, parents, teachers, caregivers and others have increasing concerns about how the disease affects them -- but there is some good news.Children do not seem to be catching the virus in the same numbers as adults, and if they do, they are not developing severe symptoms, according to data from Chinese health officials.Here's what we know right now about the impact of the coronavirus on children.Are children getting sick?Yes, children are catching the coronavirus, but they're generally developing mild cases of the illness.Out of nearly 45,000 confirmed cases in China through Feb. 11, there was only one death in someone younger than 20, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and no deaths among children younger than 10.Dr. Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley, said the numbers show children carry the coronavirus but are not developing severe symptoms."The evidence so far would suggest that children, at least in China, many children have gotten infected and have ... either had a very mild illness or not had any illness at all," Reingold told CNN, adding that's a pattern seen in many other respiratory viruses that are easily transmitted among children and by children.There have been cases in the United States, similar to other countries, where children are getting sick. A high school student in Washington, a teenager in Georgia, an elementary school-age child in California and a three-year-old in Texas have all tested positive for the disease.However, Reingold said, children are generally not developing as severe an illness from the coronavirus as older people.  Can children pass on the virus and what measures need to be taken?Just because children are not as likely to develop major symptoms, or even any at all, does not mean they won't contract the coronavirus. Reingold said it's likely that the number of cases in children is underreported, in part because their symptoms are so minimal or mild, but he warned they can still infect others."We have to assume that they can spread it. They're incredibly efficient at spreading other respiratory viruses like influenza. Of course, this is a different virus and it could be different," Reingold told CNN. "But we assume that children are extremely efficient at spreading respiratory viruses, including the new COVID-19."The biggest concern is that in small or large groups, children could still pass along the virus to those who are more susceptible -- including the elderly in the community or older family members.So parents and children should take commonsense precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention including regular hand cleaning with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Children and family members should engage in preventative measures to guard against spreading the respiratory infection, including covering coughs and staying up to date on vaccinations, according to the CDC.  But why aren't children getting sick?It's not entirely known why children aren't developing such severe cases."If they are getting infected and not getting sick, then it seems to me the most likely theory is that they do have some level of immunity, and most likely it's from being exposed to other coronaviruses," Reingold said.Because smaller numbers of children have been infected with the coronavirus or only developed mild symptoms, it's been more difficult to study the disease in the very young, according to a World Health Organization-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease report in February. Without blood test results, "it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically," according to the report."We saw low attack rates in children and that is something that is important and warrants some further study," said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program.Infected children were generally identified through contact tracing in households of adults who were sick, according to the report.Studying children with mild cases could be important to understanding why others are getting so sick, including the differences in children's immune systems and underlying conditions in adults.It could be that children don't tend to have heart disease or lung disease or other conditions that make them vulnerable to getting very sick from coronavirus. Their immune systems could play a role, Reingold said."I think the other question, and this would be a theory, is that the immune response that you see is different, that children are still maturing in terms of their immune response and that somehow, beyond the issues of frailty and underlying diseases, they simply mount a different type of immune response," he said.                        Germs spread easily among children. So as the coronavirus spreads, parents, teachers, caregivers and others have increasing concerns about how the disease affects them -- but there is some good news. Children do not seem to be catching the virus in the same numbers as adults, and if they do, they are not developing severe symptoms, according to data from Chinese health officials.

Out of nearly 45,000 confirmed cases in China through Feb. 11, there was only one death in someone younger than 20, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and no deaths among children younger than 10. Dr. Arthur Reingold, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley, said the numbers show children carry the coronavirus but are not developing severe symptoms. "The evidence so far would suggest that children, at least in China, many children have gotten infected and have ... either had a very mild illness or not had any illness at all," Reingold told CNN, adding that's a pattern seen in many other respiratory viruses that are easily transmitted among children and by children. There have been cases in the United States, similar to other countries, where children are getting sick. A high school student in Washington, a teenager in Georgia, an elementary school-age child in California and a three-year-old in Texas have all tested positive for the disease. However, Reingold said, children are generally not developing as severe an illness from the coronavirus as older people.   Can children pass on the virus and what measures need to be taken? Just because children are not as likely to develop major symptoms, or even any at all, does not mean they won't contract the coronavirus. Reingold said it's likely that the number of cases in children is underreported, in part because their symptoms are so minimal or mild, but he warned they can still infect others. "We have to assume that they can spread it. They're incredibly efficient at spreading other respiratory viruses like influenza. Of course, this is a different virus and it could be different," Reingold told CNN. "But we assume that children are extremely efficient at spreading respiratory viruses, including the new COVID-19." The biggest concern is that in small or large groups, children could still pass along the virus to those who are more susceptible -- including the elderly in the community or older family members. So parents and children should take commonsense precautions  recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  including regular hand cleaning with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Children and family members should engage in preventative measures to guard against spreading the respiratory infection, including covering coughs and staying up to date on vaccinations, according to the CDC.   But why aren't children getting sick? It's not entirely known why children aren't developing such severe cases. "If they are getting infected and not getting sick, then it seems to me the most likely theory is that they do have some level of immunity, and most likely it's from being exposed to other coronaviruses," Reingold said. Because smaller numbers of children have been infected with the coronavirus or only developed mild symptoms, it's been more difficult to study the disease in the very young,  according to a World Health Organization-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease report in February . Without blood test results, "it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or if they present differently clinically," according to the report. "We saw low attack rates in children and that is something that is important and warrants some further study," said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead of the WHO's Health Emergencies Program. Infected children were generally identified through contact tracing in households of adults who were sick, according to the report. Studying children with mild cases could be important to understanding why others are getting so sick, including the differences in children's immune systems and underlying conditions in adults. It could be that children don't tend to have heart disease or lung disease or other conditions that make them vulnerable to getting very sick from coronavirus. Their immune systems could play a role, Reingold said. "I think the other question, and this would be a theory, is that the immune response that you see is different, that children are still maturing in terms of their immune response and that somehow, beyond the issues of frailty and underlying diseases, they simply mount a different type of immune response," he said.

At least 35 coronavirus deaths are associated with the Washington state facility, according to officials. The virus infected two-thirds of residents and dozens of staff members.

The Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, which was an epicenter of COVID-19 cases in the early days of the pandemic, faces a fine of more than $611,000 if it does not correct problems found by federal inspectors.Inspectors for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found three "immediate jeopardy" deficiencies as well as several less severe issues when they first visited the facility from March 6 to March 16, a summary for that visit shows."The facility failed to have a system in place that ensured timely action related to an identified respiratory outbreak within the facility," the federal agency wrote in the report, explaining why Life Care didn't provide its residents an adequate level of care."There was no evidence the facility recognized all possible systemic risks and concerns related to this known outbreak," the report adds.At least 35 coronavirus deaths are associated with the Washington state facility, according to officials.

An exclusive look inside Oklahoma exotic zoo after ‘Tiger King’ documentary

One of the most popular shows in the country right now is "Tiger King." But things have changed in Wynnewood since those Netflix cameras stopped rolling.

The big headlines are focused on coronavirus and quarantine. It’s given a lot of people time to binge watch.One of the most popular shows in the country right now is "Tiger King." But things have changed in Wynnewood since those Netflix cameras stopped rolling.For the first time, the new owners of the zoo are letting a camera inside. Sister station KOCO went on an exclusive journey inside the park to show viewers what it looks like now and what the main characters are up to.Inside a home on the property, you'll find Jeff and Lauren Lowe. To the contrary to what some might believe, their home life is somewhat normal on the inside.Their focus? Their baby girl, Sara.“She's so easy going,” Jeff said.“He's a wonderful dad. Watching him interact with her. He is a great father,” Lauren said. On the outside — a world of wild animals, mainly big cats. It's likely why you know them as they are a major part of the Netflix documentary, Tiger King.Once it aired, it was a major change. Their faces are now recognizable from people on the street to celebrities. Everyone is talking about it online. In fact, KOCO was there for a FaceTime with Coolio. And if you have watched, you recognize the cast of characters and the spot where Joe Exotic was seen in the show nearly getting bit.The tigers are still there.The workers are still tending to the cats that need them, not paying too much attention to the attention.“Hasn't really changed much, but it's interesting meeting new people,” Alan Glover said. The place is a lot different now.“It was just the Joe show,” Jeff said. But with Joe now in prison, they are moving forward.“It's never a happy day when someone gets their freedom stripped from them,” Jeff said.They are keeping their eye on what's next: a move to a new, bigger zoo.“We are going to leave this place behind and we are going to take all the animals with us,” Jeff said. The new zoo is expected to open in Thackerville once construction completes. “Can’t wait to get out of here, and look forward to the new zoo,” Erik Cowie said.KOCO spoke with a friend of Joe Exotic, who said he is at a Fort Worth facility, currently in quarantine because of possible exposure to the coronavirus. Because of that, no one has heard from him for some time.               WYNNEWOOD, Okla.

Postal employees ask for help from customers amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
The U.S. Postal Service has provided carriers with gloves, masks and hand sanitizer, but there are ways customers can help, too.

Bill Silay has worked for the postal service, in the Pittsburgh area, for 30 years. He said the threat of COVID-19 has changed things slightly. He is now wearing gloves and asking customers for a little help. "If they could wipe off the handle of their door if they have a door slot because we have to open it," Silay said. "If we could leave their box open that way neither one of us is touching the mailbox."Silay said customers along his route have been kind, friendly and appreciative. "The customers are bring fantastic," he said. "They're keeping a distance, most times they're staying in their house, and then when we leave they might come out,  they might say hi."According to Jill Walters, spokesperson for the USPS, mail itself is safe, based on information from the World Health Organization. "The risk of catching a virus from a package that is moved, traveled or exposed to different conditions is also low," Walters said.Walters said the postal service has, however, made some changes to delivery."To reduce the health risks, we are temporarily modifying the customer's signature procedures, so there is no pen-to-pen touch with the hands," Walters said. Silay said the postal service has provided each carrier with gloves, masks and hand sanitizer and has given them a sanitizer to clean their vehicles with, as often as they feel necessary. He said that, combined with help and kind words from the customers, is key. "I just had a gentleman thank me up on the avenue. He said thanks for coming out here everyday," Silay said.

"It was in her DNA to serve and to give back to the community."

In her final days, Janice Preschel continued to run the Helping Hands Food Pantry from her hospital bed in New Jersey.On Monday, Preschel died of complications from COVID-19 at a Teaneck hospital, Gov. Phil Murphy said. She was 60.Murphy said on Thursday that 25,590 people across the state have tested positive for disease, and 537 have died."Even while she was in the hospital suffering and waiting for her test results and having difficulty breathing, she was still on the phone with me and emailing and sending me instructions on the pantry," said Teaneck Deputy Mayor Elie Katz, who wrote a speech that was read at Preschel's funeral service on Wednesday.Katz said he tapped Preschel to start the food pantry to help families struggling after the 2008 financial crisis."She jumped at the opportunity and, when I told her the salary was zero, she continued to jump at the opportunity," said Katz. "It was in her DNA to serve and to give back to the community."Katz said Preschel's family has asked those who knew her to spread the word of her plight with the respiratory disease to stress the importance of social distancing. She is survived by two brothers and a sister.Preschel was a former president of the Teaneck Rotary, according to Katz. She was a member of Temple Emeth and a volunteer on the township's social services advisory board."For five years, Janice worked out of my office," Katz said in his speech. "Her desk was three feet away from my desk. She ran the pantry like a well-oiled machine, making sure the volunteers were properly trained and that the donated food was picked up and ready for distribution and, above all, ensuring that each recipient was treated with care, respect, and dignity."From her hospital bed, Preschel fired off almost daily emails to Katz about the workings of the pantry, he said."She will be remembered as someone who gave herself to giving back to the community," said Katz, who is close to Preschel's family. "She literally would eat, breathe or sleep helping the 100-something families who use the pantry every single week."Preschel kept active in the community even after a viral infection left her legally blind about five years ago, Katz said."She didn't slow down or stop from running the food pantry," he said.In one of her last emails to Katz, he said Preschel asked him to stop by the pantry to personally thank the volunteers before it temporarily shut down because of the pandemic.

Adam Sandler debuts a sweet — and hilarious — song about doctors and nurses
.W
Adam Sandler has created a hilarious, loving tribute to doctors and nurses around the world who are fighting the coronavirus.

One of the few welcome surprises during the coronavirus outbreak is the revitalization of the late-night talk show. Now that most folks are staying inside their homes, hosts like Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Kimmel have started broadcasting via video chat."The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" has been no different. On Thursday, Adam Sandler video-called Fallon, where, from the comfort of their homes, the two "Saturday Night Live" alums shared stories about Robin Williams, and joked around about Fallon’s Sandler impression. Plus, at the end, a surprise — the comedic whipped out his electric guitar, and debuted a hilarious, loving tribute to doctors and nurses around the world who are fighting the coronavirus. “Doctors brought us into this world as babies // Doctors take good care of your grandma,” Sandler sings. “Doctors always give you an old lollipop after hitting your knee with a hammer // Doctors and nurses will save us from this mess if we give them the supplies that they need // And I hope they save us soon because I’m really, really sick my family.”Of course, Sandler and songwriting go hand-in-hand — you can log his quarantine ballad in his lengthy catalog of comedic jams, like “The Chanukah Song,” and “I Wanna Grow Old With You” from "The Wedding Singer." Plus, don’t forget Sandler’s ode to his late best friend, Chris Farley, which he debuted during a Netflix comedy special in 2018. For now, though, stay inside — and listen to the sweet lullabies of the Sandman.      “We love you doctors and nurses, you’re saving lives every day // Find a cure for this s***, because I really, really miss hugging my mailman,” Sandler sings in the ending of the song.

Feds direct airlines to refund passengers for canceled flights
.W
Federal officials have ordered airlines to reimburse customers for canceled flights, saying a growing number of passengers are complaining amid the coronavirus pandemic that airlines are providing travel credits rather than refunds.

Federal officials on Friday ordered airlines to reimburse customers for canceled flights, saying a growing number of passengers are complaining amid the coronavirus pandemic that airlines are providing travel credits rather than refunds.The U.S. Department of Transportation did not say how many claims it has substantiated, but it did direct carriers in an enforcement notice "that passengers should be refunded promptly when their scheduled flights are cancelled or significantly delayed."The government said it would "exercise its prosecutorial discretion" and allow airlines time to contact customers, update policies and properly train staff."The Department is receiving an increasing number of complaints and inquiries from ticketed passengers, including many with non-refundable tickets, who describe having been denied refunds for flights that were cancelled or significantly delayed," the notice read.Customers are allowed to receive a refund when airlines cancel or significantly delay flights. The requirements also apply when government restrictions prohibit flying, the notice said.The rules do not apply to customers who decide on their own against flying because, for example, of concern over the coronavirus.Airlines canceled significant portions of their schedules as demand plummeted. By late February, customers were canceling more flights than they were booking, according to the industry group Airlines for America.Now, industry metrics show carriers are flying about half their schedules and only about 1 in 10 seats are filled.The mass cancellations mean airlines owe customers a substantial amount. Worldwide, airlines owe their customers $35 billion in refunds and credits this financial quarter, according to the International Air Transport Association. Different regions have different refund and credit requirements.The Transportation Department notice said many passengers complained of receiving credit toward future flights that cannot be used because of the deep schedule cuts, which extend into the fall."As a result, passengers are left with cancelled or significantly delayed flights and vouchers and credits for future travel that are not readily usable," the notice said.Many airline vouchers expire after a year. Delta announced earlier on Friday it would accept coronavirus-related flight credits for about two years, until the end of May 2022.A different US agency, the Federal Trade Commission, has received more than 1,600 travel- and vacation-related complaints so far linked to the coronavirus, according to FTC data reviewed by CNN. Those complaints, including from people seeking their money back on nonrefundable travel, claim losses of $2.7 million.DOT noted that carriers provided refunds, as required, after incidents including the September 11, 2001, terror attacks."Although the COVID-19 public health emergency has had an unprecedented impact on air travel, the airlines' obligation to refund passengers for cancelled or significantly delayed flights remains unchanged," the agency said.

Reports: Multiple Kentucky residents with COVID-19 refused to stay home, ordered to wear ankle bracelets
.W
Kentucky residents who tested positive or who were exposed to the coronavirus and failed to avoid others are being ordered to wear ankle bracelets.

Kentucky residents who have been in contact with coronavirus patients or tested positive for COVID-19 — but refused to isolate themselves — have been forced to wear ankle bracelets.Judges have ordered multiple residents to wear tracking devices after they refused to stay at home, the The Courier-Journal reported.WDRB-TV reports that one person, identified as D.L. in the court order, is living with "someone who has tested positive for the illness and another person who is a presumptive case," according to an affidavit from Dr. Sarah Moyer, director of the health department.Having been exposed to the highly contagious disease, D.L. was ordered to stay at home last week. But according to family members, D.L. "leaves the house often."When D.L. didn't respond to the health department's messages, Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Angela Bisig ordered the Department of Corrections to fit D.L. with a global positioning device for the next 14 days. If D.L. leaves the house again, he or she could be criminally charged, WDRB-TV reports.D.L. is not the only Louisville resident ordered to wear ankle monitors to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Two other people who live in the same home — one who has tested positive, and the other who has not — were ordered to remain in their home last week after both refused to stay isolated.And another man was put under house arrest after he went out shopping despite having tested positive for the coronavirus, according to WDRB-TV.Video: Hospital ships begin treating non-virus patientsWDRB-TV says courts have set up an on-call judge for these types of cases.Under Kentucky's current guidelines, which are aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, only life-sustaining businesses can remain open.Organizations that provide charitable and social services can also remain open. These include food banks and places that provide food, shelter and social services to those who are economically disadvantaged or people with disabilities. But even these organizations must implement social distancing while carrying out their work.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has recommended all schools remain closed through May 1 and has expanded travel restrictions. Out-of-staters who aren't passing through have to quarantine for 14 days, wherever they are coming from.The state will also be releasing at least 186 prisoners convicted of not-so-serious crimes on commuted sentences. However, the prisoners must identify a residence where they can stay and where they will be required to quarantine for a period of 14 days, according to Michael Brown, the secretary of the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.Beshear has announced a COVID-19 reporting hotline (833-KY SAFER, or 833-597-2337) for complaints about non-compliance with coronavirus mandates. Labor Cabinet personnel will monitor the hotline from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET.Residents can also visit the website kysafer.ky.gov to make online complaints.Hearst TV contributed to this report.

What to know about pandemics amid race to make a coronavirus vaccine
.W
From whether you need a face mask to how much supplies you should have, here's what you need to know.

Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the novel coronavirus will spread in U.S. communities, and a case announced on Wednesday might be the country's first instance of it.Now, health officials say, is the time for people in the U.S. to prepare — for canceled events, closed schools and interrupted work, and for the potential of widespread illness.No one knows what community spread could look like in the United States. It could be mild or very severe. In case of an outbreak that spreads within U.S. communities, what can you do to protect yourself and your family?Here are 10 questions answered about how to prepare.1. What should I buy?The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommends on its website that, before a pandemic strikes, you store a two-week supply of water and food, as well as over-the-counter medications you tend to take."Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins," according to the department."In general for emergency preparedness, we encourage all households to have an emergency response kit," which could be used during any public health or severe weather emergency, said Jennifer Kertanis, president-elect of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.2. Are there places I should avoid?The CDC has released travel warnings and alerts in relation to coronavirus disease.As of Wednesday, the CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to mainland China and South Korea. Travel alerts for older people and people with chronic medical conditions to consider postponing nonessential travel have been issued for Italy, Iran and Japan.Regarding whether there are places to avoid in your community, such as the grocery store or library, health officials recommend to simply be mindful of avoiding close contact with people who may be sick.Also, if you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.3. Should I keep my child home from school?If your child is sick, it's important to keep them home from school in order to protect other students from getting sick. But if your child is not sick, monitor local school closings.Widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus could lead to schools, child care centers and other places for mass gatherings experiencing more absenteeism and even shutting down if that precaution is needed, according to the CDC.Closing schools or canceling gatherings in response to public health concerns are common actions that school districts have had to make before throughout history."Even in my own state of Maine, schools have in recent weeks and months had to close for influenza. During the H1N1 crisis many years ago, schools were also closed then," said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.For the coronavirus, however, "one of the questions that is scientifically out there that will govern or drive how school closures are calculated is to what extent children themselves carry or transmit this virus," he said. "Scientifically we need to have a better understanding of to what extent children are carriers or transmitters of the virus. The point of that is, it's premature right now based on the science to make uniform claims about what school closures may look like."Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told her family that while they are not at risk right now, they should plan for what to do if their lives were significantly impacted, she said during a press briefing on Tuesday. She also said she called the children's school district about what would happen if schools need to close.Messonnier said her agency wants people to understand their lives might be disrupted."We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad," she said, adding that while CDC officials hope the spread won't be severe in the United States, they are planning as if it could be.4. Should I work from home?Community spread of the virus could be reasonably mild or very severe. But Americans should still talk to employers about whether working online will be an option if needed, according to the CDC.The CDC has even posted guidance on its website to help businesses and employers plan for possibly including telework or flexible sick leave policies into operations if there is significant spread of coronavirus across the country.Sick employees shouldn't return to work until their temperature has stayed below 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 24 hours, without the help of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicine, the CDC said.Yet, "what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place," Shah said."Although we believe, according to the U.S. CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility, as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state," he said, adding because of that, "there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here." 5. What should I do about my medications?Before a pandemic, it is recommended to periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure you have a continuous supply in your home if needed, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Also, it could be helpful to get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them for personal reference.6. What if I have to go to the doctor?Talk to your doctor's office about telehealth options.Your doctor likely offers the option to conduct an appointment over the phone or via video conferencing, and if not, your doctor could recommend a physician who does.7. Do I need a face mask?The CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear face masks.Rather, the CDC recommends to only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A face mask should be used by people who have the novel coronavirus and are showing symptoms — that is in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected.Overall, the use of face masks remains crucial for health workers and people who are caring for someone infected with the virus in close settings, such as a health care facility or at home, according to the CDC.While the CDC does not recommend N95 respirator masks for the general public, it does recommend them for health care workers. But certain types of facial hair can prevent respirators from working effectively. So, the CDC created an infographic showing which styles of facial hair are riskier than others.8. If I don't need a mask, how can I avoid getting sick?There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease, so the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus, according to the CDC.The CDC also notes that there are several things to do to prevent the spread of any respiratory diseases:Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouthCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throw the tissue awayClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objectsWash your hands often with soap and waterThe proper way to wash your hands is for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating, after going to the bathroom and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.In general, the public should do "what you do every cold and flu season," said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state, where the first U.S. case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed.Since it is currently flu season in the U.S., the CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine. It's not too late. Remember to also practice other good health habits too, such as managing stress and drinking plenty of fluids."Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now," Shah, of Maine CDC, said.9. What if someone in my household has the virus — or thinks they do?The best way to first determine whether you have the virus is to get tested.If you develop a fever, cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after travel from China, call your doctor right away. If you have had close contact with someone who has traveled and is showing those symptoms, you should call ahead to a doctor, according to the CDC.Your doctor will then work with your state's public health department and the CDC to determine if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus.An infected person might not show symptoms for up to 14 days after exposure. That's especially worrisome because this novel coronavirus can be transmitted while a person isn't showing any symptoms. Fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and trouble breathing are some of the most common symptoms of the novel coronavirus.If you are sick or suspect you are, the CDC recommends to stay home except to get medical care and separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.Call ahead before visiting your doctor's office so that the office can make preparations to keep other people from getting infected or exposed to the virus.In the case of suspected coronavirus, if you are sick, the CDC does recommend to wear a face mask, and cover your coughs and sneezes, clean your hands often and avoid sharing personal household items with others, such as utensils, dishes or bedding.10. What if I want more information?If you have more questions about the novel coronavirus, contact your local health department or find more information on the CDC's website at www.cdc.gov."One of the things that local health departments and state health departments are really doing is trying to make sure that we're getting the best information out so that we're quelling fear but at the same time leaning forward and preparing people as this continues to grow and develop," said Kertanis, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials."In any type of situation like this where we're dealing with a new illness, something that's growing and changing rapidly, it's almost fear of the unknown," she said.Experts have said that the most important thing you can do is not panic and stay informed."We really want to urge everyone to avoid dubious sources of information and stick with trusted sources like their state health departments or the U.S. CDC," Shah said. "We're in a situation where fear and misinformation can spread more quickly than this virus."                        Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned that the novel coronavirus will spread in U.S. communities, and a case announced on Wednesday might be the country's first instance of it. Now, health officials say, is the time for people in the U.S. to prepare — for canceled events, closed schools and interrupted work, and for the potential of widespread illness.                              Advertisement                       No one knows what community spread could look like in the United States. It could be mild or very severe. In case of an outbreak that spreads within U.S. communities, what can you do to protect yourself and your family? Here are 10 questions answered about how to prepare. 1. What should I buy? The  U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommends on its website  that, before a pandemic strikes, you store a two-week supply of water and food, as well as over-the-counter medications you tend to take. "Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins," according to the department. "In general for emergency preparedness, we encourage all households to have an emergency response kit," which could be used during any public health or severe weather emergency, said Jennifer Kertanis, president-elect of the  National Association of County and City Health Officials . 2. Are there places I should avoid? The CDC has released travel warnings and alerts in relation to coronavirus disease. As of Wednesday, the CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to  mainland China  and  South Korea . Travel alerts for older people and people with chronic medical conditions to consider postponing nonessential travel have been issued for  Italy ,  Iran  and  Japan . Regarding whether there are places to avoid in your community, such as the grocery store or library, health officials recommend to simply be mindful of  avoiding close contact with people who may be sick . Also, if you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. 3. Should I keep my child home from school? If your child is sick, it's important to keep them home from school in order to protect other students from getting sick. But if your child is not sick, monitor local school closings. Widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus could lead to schools, child care centers and other places for mass gatherings  experiencing more absenteeism  and even shutting down if that precaution is needed, according to the CDC. Closing schools or canceling gatherings in response to public health concerns are common actions that school districts have had to make before throughout history. "Even in my own state of Maine, schools have in recent weeks and months had to close for influenza. During the H1N1 crisis many years ago, schools were also closed then," said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the  Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention  and a member of the  Association of State and Territorial Health Officials .                                                                                                       CDC confirms first US coronavirus case of 'unknown' origin; California monitors over 8,000 people                          For the coronavirus, however, "one of the questions that is scientifically out there that will govern or drive how school closures are calculated is to what extent children themselves carry or transmit this virus," he said. "Scientifically we need to have a better understanding of to what extent children are carriers or transmitters of the virus. The point of that is, it's premature right now based on the science to make uniform claims about what school closures may look like." Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told her family that while they are not at risk right now, they should plan for what to do if their lives were significantly impacted, she said during a press briefing on Tuesday. She also said she called the children's school district about what would happen if schools need to close. Messonnier said her agency wants people to understand their lives might be disrupted.                     "We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad," she said, adding that while CDC officials hope the spread won't be severe in the United States, they are planning as if it could be. 4. Should I work from home? Community spread of the virus could be reasonably mild or very severe. But Americans should still talk to employers about whether working online will be an option if needed,  according to the CDC . The CDC has even posted  guidance on its website to help businesses  and employers plan for possibly including telework or flexible sick leave policies into operations if there is significant spread of coronavirus across the country. Sick employees shouldn't return to work until their temperature has stayed below 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 24 hours, without the help of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicine,  the CDC said .                     Yet, "what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place," Shah said. "Although we believe, according to the U.S. CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility, as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state," he said, adding because of that, "there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here."  5. What should I do about my medications? Before a pandemic, it is recommended to periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure you have a continuous supply in your home if needed, according to the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security . Also, it could be helpful to get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them for personal reference. 6. What if I have to go to the doctor? Talk to your doctor's office about telehealth options. Your doctor likely offers the option to conduct an appointment over the phone or via video conferencing, and if not, your doctor could recommend a physician who does. 7. Do I need a face mask? The CDC  does not recommend  that people who are well wear face masks. Rather, the CDC recommends to only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A face mask should be used by people who have the novel coronavirus and are showing symptoms — that is in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected. Overall, the use of face masks remains crucial for health workers and people who are caring for someone infected with the virus in close settings, such as a health care facility or at home, according to the CDC. While the CDC does not recommend  N95 respirator masks  for the general public, it  does recommend them for health care workers . But certain  types of facial hair can prevent respirators  from working effectively. So, the CDC created an  infographic showing which styles of facial hair  are riskier than others. 8. If I don't need a mask, how can I avoid getting sick? There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease, so the best way to  prevent illness  is to avoid being exposed to the virus, according to the CDC. The CDC also notes that there are several things to do to prevent the spread of any respiratory diseases: Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throw the tissue away Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects Wash your hands often with soap and water The proper way to wash your hands is for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating, after going to the bathroom and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. In general, the public should do "what you do every cold and flu season," said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state, where  the first U.S. case of the novel coronavirus  was confirmed.                                                                                                                      Coronavirus 'WILL' spread in the US, CDC says                          Since it is currently flu season in the U.S., the  CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine . It's not too late. Remember to also practice other good health habits too, such as managing stress and drinking plenty of fluids. "Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now," Shah, of Maine CDC, said. 9. What if someone in my household has the virus — or thinks they do? The best way to first determine whether you have the virus is to get tested. If you develop a fever, cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after travel from China, call your doctor right away. If you have had close contact with someone who has traveled and is showing those symptoms, you should call ahead to a doctor,  according to the CDC . Your doctor will then work with your state's public health department and the CDC to determine if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus. An infected person might not show symptoms for up to 14 days after exposure. That's especially worrisome because this novel coronavirus  can be transmitted while a person isn't showing any symptoms . Fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and trouble breathing are some of the most common symptoms of the novel coronavirus.                                                                                                            The CDC has thoughts about facial hair. They all have to do with preventing coronavirus                          If you are sick or suspect you are, the CDC recommends to stay home except to get medical care and separate yourself from other people and animals in your home. Call ahead before visiting your doctor's office so that the office can make preparations to keep other people from getting infected or exposed to the virus. In the case of suspected coronavirus,  if you are sick , the CDC does recommend to wear a face mask, and cover your coughs and sneezes, clean your hands often and avoid sharing personal household items with others, such as utensils, dishes or bedding. 10. What if I want more information? If you have more questions about the novel coronavirus, contact your local health department or find more information on the CDC's website at  www.cdc.gov . "One of the things that local health departments and state health departments are really doing is trying to make sure that we're getting the best information out so that we're quelling fear but at the same time leaning forward and preparing people as this continues to grow and develop," said Kertanis, of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. "In any type of situation like this where we're dealing with a new illness, something that's growing and changing rapidly, it's almost fear of the unknown," she said.                                                                                                                      US clinical trials of drug to treat coronavirus begin                          Experts have said that the most important thing you can do is not panic and stay informed. "We really want to urge everyone to avoid dubious sources of information and stick with trusted sources like their state health departments or the U.S. CDC," Shah said. "We're in a situation where fear and misinformation can spread more quickly than this virus."

Barcelona, Spain, where it was installed, has hosted the event for 14 years.Organizers of the world’s biggest mobile technology fair insisted Thursday that they canceled the annual Mobile World Congress due to health and safety concerns over the virus outbreak in China. The decision to scrap the Feb. 24-27 event in Barcelona was taken after dozens of tech companies and wireless carriers dropped out over the COVID-19 virus, including major companies like Amazon, Intel, LG, Nokia and Sony. The companies cited concerns for the safety of staff and visitors.Meanwhile, the Spanish government said in a statement Thursday it “believes it is not public health reasons in Spain that have motivated the cancellation.”Related video: Why Leonardo da Vinci may have abandoned the 'Mona Lisa' after fainting“There is no public health reason to not hold events of this type in our country,” the government added.

Some states receive masks with dry rot, broken ventilators

Nearly 6,000 medical masks sent to Alabama had dry rot and a 2010 expiration date.

Some states and cities that have been shipped masks, gloves, ventilators and other essential equipment from the nation's medical stockpile to fight the coronavirus have gotten an unwelcome surprise: the material is unusable.Nearly 6,000 medical masks sent to Alabama had dry rot and a 2010 expiration date. More than 150 ventilators sent to Los Angeles were broken and had to be repaired. In Oregon, it was masks with faulty elastic that could cause the straps to snap, exposing medical workers to the disease.“Several of the shipments we have received from the strategic national stockpile contained (personal protective equipment) well past expiration dates and, while we are being told much of the expired equipment is capable of being used for COVID-19 response, they would not be suitable for use in surgical settings," Charles Boyle, a spokesman for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, said in an email.He said some of the equipment had been purchased during the H1N1 outbreak more than a decade ago and that the masks with the fragile elastic had been among products previously recalled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state did not distribute them to medical workers.Related video: Trump says NY should have ordered more ventilatorsA shortage of protective gear has imperiled doctors, nurses and other front-line medical workers. Life-saving ventilators have been in short supply as more and more states experience outbreaks of the COVID-19 disease, which typically causes mild or moderate symptoms but can be especially perilous for older adults and people with existing health problems. Many younger adults and medical workers also have succumbed to the disease.Numerous governors have complained about delays in getting equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile or receiving amounts of gear far below what they had requested. That frustration is compounded when equipment arrives, but can’t be used.Dr. Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association and the former top public health official in the state, said he received multiple emails from hospitals about stockpile shipments of N95 masks in which the rubber bands that hold the mask tight around the user’s face had dry rot. They couldn't be used unless the bands were replaced.Montgomery County received nearly 6,000 medical masks of a different type that had dry rot, a shipment that was replaced about a week later.“It’s really alarming because those masks are desperately needed," said U.S. Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama. “When our national stockpile is not monitored enough to know that you’ve got expired masks and rotted masks out there and not replenished, that is a real problem.”Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado on Friday requested a probe into the management of the supply and distribution of ventilators from the national stockpile. Among other things, he cited reports that maintenance failures were contributing to the lack of operational ventilators “at a time our country desperately needs them.”Los Angeles received about 170 ventilators from the national stockpile that were in disrepair. Gov. Gavin Newsom said they were sent to a company to be fixed.In New Hampshire, the congressional delegation wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services saying many of the supplies the state received were expired. In addition, more than 16,000 latex gloves couldn't be used in a medical setting because of latex allergies.The CDC acknowledged late last month that some items in the U.S. stockpile have exceeded their manufacturer-designated shelf life. They were nevertheless being sent to hospitals “due to the potential urgent demand caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency,” the CDC said.              MONTGOMERY, Ala.

Retirement community requesting cards from kids to combat loneliness during coronavirus

Staff members at the facility are trying to make sure no one feels alone while social distancing and being separated from their families on the outside.

During the coronavirus outbreak, nursing home communities are working overtime to keep residents both physically and mentally healthy. At the Kenwood by Senior Star in Cincinnati, staff members are trying to make sure no one feels alone while social distancing and being separated from their families on the outside. Sisters Janice Amatulli and Danielle Revelson have not seen their dad James Markley face-to-face in a month."I miss just getting to be in there with him and chat with him and give him a hug, give him a kiss," said Amatulli. "I know he's not happy, and it's hard."No one at the retirement community has been diagnosed with COVID-19. The facility has spent weeks cracking down and implementing new measures to protect the high-risk group of 300 residents. No outside visitors, including family and friends, are allowed."I think at the Kenwood they do a great job, but it's nothing like you being there," Revelson said. Markley worked until he was 93 years old and enjoys interacting with his peers."Dad is one that would wander out his room and just walk around. He can't do that anymore, and I think it's driving him crazy," Amatulli said. His 99th birthday party was last week. The sisters, along with several other family members, including Markley's grandchildren and greatchildren, stood outside the building with big signs and balloons to wish him happy birthday. "He will often say that he's lonely," Revelson said. "You keep thinking, well, one foot in front of the other. Take it one day at time. And that's how you'll continue to cope."Associate Executive Director Scott Gibson said he sees daily how residents and families are struggling during this difficult time. Gibson said the facility is getting creative and going the extra mile so that residents do not feel isolated. "When you social distance, it takes a lot more time and effort," he said. The facility's upscale dining rooms, theaters and community spaces are not being utilized right now. Meals now need to be delivered to each resident's room. Exercise and socialization is proving to be an ongoing challenge."We're doing a lot of the one-on-one," Gibson said. "We're painting with them. We're singing."That is a greater challenge in the facility's health care and memory care units, which cares for residents suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia. One of the ways staff members are keeping residents engaged is through social distancing activities, setting each resident in their doorway for arts and crafts, bingo or exercises. Residents are also getting the chance to video chat with family members, garden and interact with a therapy dog.Donations of activity books and supplies are helping aid the group's efforts. Earlier this week, Rivers Crossing Church dropped off 650 bags packed with snacks and activities, like crossword puzzles. Children from the church made hand-written cards for the residents.The facility has now launched a "Send a Smile" letter campaign, asking students to write a letter to help cheer residents up and combat anxiety and loneliness. The letters can be as long or short as the student wants and can share a fun story or something learned in school or create a piece of art. The Kenwood said all letters will be disinfected before residents receive them. Letters can be sent to: The Kenwood by Senior Star C/O Annette DeCamp, Kenwood Programs and Events Director 5435 Kenwood Road Cincinnati, OH 45227.             CINCINNATI

Millions of dads are stuck at home — which could be a game changer for working moms

Researchers predict that millions of dads will be staying home with their kids, a historic moment they say could forever shift dynamics in both firms and families, leading to greater gender equality down the road.

Globally, more than 1.3 billion children are out of school because of the coronavirus pandemic. Parents are frazzled. Children are antsy. And the whole thing is proving a major shock to society.Four economists have a hypothesis for how this shock could play out on a massive scale. In a new research paper, Matthias Doepke and Jane Olmstead-Rumsey of Northwestern University, Titan Alon of the University of California San Diego and Michèle Tertilt of the University of Mannheim predict two big outcomes for gender equality.Over the short run, they predict, working moms will shoulder a higher burden than dads when it comes to providing childcare in the pandemic.However, the researchers also predict that millions of dads will be staying home with their kids, a historic moment they say could forever shift dynamics in both firms and families, leading to greater gender equality down the road.Here's how.Why moms have it harderThe coronavirus recession will be different than any other downturn for many reasons. Among them: the way it impacts women and men in the labor force.First, some history. Early on in recessions, it's common for men to lose more jobs than women. The Great Recession, for example, was even nicknamed the "mancession" because initially men bore 78% of the job losses. This happens in part because men dominate sectors such as manufacturing and construction, which are prone to steep declines in an economic downturn, whereas women dominate jobs in nursing and teaching, which are more resistant to job losses.With the coronavirus recession, however, the steepest layoffs early on are in low-wage service jobs, which are closer to 50-50, if not slightly skewed toward women. Women hold 52% of restaurant jobs, 60% of hotel jobs and 50% of retail jobs, for example. According to Doepke and his colleagues, women are also slightly less likely than men to work in occupations that have high rates of telecommuting, such as computer, financial and mathematical professions. For working moms in any of these groups, serving as the primary childcare provider is more of a necessity than a choice now that work has dried up and schools are closed.Among middle class and higher income couples — particularly those who have the ability to work from home — job losses may not be as severe, but tradeoffs within families will still be common. After all, someone has to watch the kids. In heterosexual couples, that responsibility is still likely to fall on women.That's for several reasons including the pay gap and social norms. On average, working women make less than their male partners, spend more time on unpaid household labor including cooking, cleaning and childcare, and are more likely to sacrifice their own careers to prioritize their partner's work. These things are all true today even though women have made significant strides over the last 50 years.As of 2017, men still out-earned women in 69% of heterosexual couples, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. That pay gap, for many families, leads to a default decision to prioritize the husband's career."In the majority of households, where the man is the higher earner, there is going to be a temptation to cater to his career — and it's not impossible that it could have longer term effects," said Francine Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University who has conducted numerous studies on the gender pay gap.It's not just money that makes the decision. Even in families where women are the higher breadwinner, research has shown moms are more likely than dads to opt out of the labor force to care for children."In a lot of cases, gender trumps money," said Kristin Smith, a visiting research associate professor at Dartmouth who wrote her Ph.D dissertation on that phenomenon. "Our social roles are so much more powerful in decision-making than money."All these dynamics are unfolding in households now in response to the dearth of childcare during the coronavirus pandemic. Which is why it's not surprising Doepke and his colleagues hypothesize working moms are likely picking up the largest share of childcare and homeschooling in many homes.It will take years for economists to collect all the data and analyze whether this was actually the case. But right now, they are also hopeful this moment could eventually lead to lasting change.A moment like World War IIWhile many mothers are likely to pick up the largest share of childcare during the crisis, that won't be true in all families. In some households, traditional gender roles will be reversed.Take for example families with moms who work in the health care industry and are fighting COVID-19 on the frontlines. Women hold 4 million or 78% of all hospital jobs. They also hold 70% of pharmacy jobs and 51% of grocery store roles, another area that has been crucial in the pandemic. In many of these families, men will inevitably turn into the main childcare providers, either because they lost their own jobs or are able to work from home, Doepke and his colleagues say.Overall, that will mean millions of dads will suddenly find themselves as the primary caregiver, many for the first time in their lives. Such a dramatic shift in gender roles hasn't happened since World War II, when millions of married women entered the labor force for the first time to replace men in factories.That moment in history, still symbolized by Rosie the Riveter in the popular imagination, ended up increasing the participation of some married women — particularly white, educated women — in the labor force, even after the war ended, according to research by Harvard economist Claudia Goldin and Dartmouth economist Claudia Olivetti.Likewise, Doepke and his colleagues think the coronavirus pandemic could increase men's participation in household labor, including childcare, even after the pandemic is over. They cite studies documenting how paternity leave policies in Spain and Germany increased fathers' involvement in childcare later on."During the current crisis, many millions of men are on a form of forced paternity leave for a much longer period, and a sizeable fraction will be the main providers of childcare during this time," Doepke and his colleagues wrote. "Hence, even while women carry a higher burden during the crisis, it is still highly likely that we will observe a sizeable impact of this forced experiment on social norms, and ultimately on gender equality, in the near future." There's another way, too, that the coronavirus pandemic could advance gender equality. Many businesses are adopting widespread work-from-home options for the first time. Now that they've invested in telecommuting technologies and acclimated to that experience, it's unlikely they'll go all the way back to the pre-pandemic way of working. Doepke and his colleagues predict some flexible work arrangements will remain in place."All these companies now have to make this work, with families being at home and having these other responsibilities," Doepke said. "It might be a culture shock that has implications on equality."According to Goldin's research, the lack of flexible work arrangements is one factor that drives the pay gap between men and women. If that were to change, and more companies encouraged flexible work options in the future, that shift could possibly lead to a narrower pay gap, as well.Ultimately, how all this will play out is hard to say, Goldin said. But economists will study the coronavirus recession — and its reverberations on gender equality — for years to come.

Most people recover from the coronavirus. Here's why it's hard to pinpoint exactly how many

Although there have been regional, national and global data on confirmed cases and deaths, not much has been reported on recovery.

It's a question that many want answered: Exactly how often do people recover from the coronavirus?Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care, while severe cases often receive supportive care in the hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although there have been regional, national and global data on confirmed cases and deaths, not much has been reported on recovery.Johns Hopkins University, which is among few institutions that have been tracking recovered cases, has been doing so since its data collection on COVID-19 cases was first made public in an online dashboard in January, Douglas Donovan, a spokesman for the university in Baltimore, said in an email Friday."The category for recoveries began when the outbreak was centered in China, which was issuing official reports on recoveries," Donovan said in the email.Then as the outbreak spread around the world, the researchers realized that there were few methods for reporting recoveries and so they decided to limit reports to country estimates only."Recovered cases outside China are country-level estimates based on local media reports and may be substantially lower than the true number," Donovan said.As for U.S. cases, "the dashboard is not reporting estimates for state and county recoveries in the United States. That may change as more uniform reporting for recoveries expands among local and state governments," he said. "Currently there is no uniform method for reporting recoveries across the United States. If that changes the dashboard will reflect those numbers accordingly."As of Saturday, more than 233,000 people worldwide have recovered from COVID-19, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. The actual figure is likely to be higher since the data only cover confirmed cases.Why tracking recovered cases is importantKnowing the number of recovered cases could help provide an accurate measure of the total number of people that have been infected, said Dr. Bala Hota, a professor of infectious diseases and the associate medical officer for Rush University Medical Center in Chicago."Knowing the real number of infected people in the population would be very useful to have better models of when disease will peak and decline, and also when we can begin to return people to work," Hota said.Recovery data also could indicate how easily people can build immunity against the virus."Previously infected people will be able to be excluded as susceptible individuals in modeling, which would impact the prediction of how many cases will occur in the near future," Hota said. "At an individual level, if people can know if they were asymptomatically or mildly infected and recovered, they can know that they are immune and can safely return to work once the shelter at home is eliminated."There's no evidence to date that people who recover from COVID-19 can get re-infected with the novel coronavirus — though there isn't a lot of data in general, Hota said. He added that identifying those who recover could help indicate those who have built immunity, at least in the short term."This is a little bit of an understudied group," Hota said about recovered COVID-19 patients. "Being able to ...and say you've been exposed, you've recovered, and we believe you're immune, I think that'll be very powerful."'Recovery ... can take some time'Currently there is no treatment for COVID-19 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but those infected can recover with appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms.The CDC has noted that for those with COVID-19 isolated at home, they are considered recovered if they meet three criteria:No fever for at least 72 hours without using fever-reducing medicationsImprovement in other coronavirus-related symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breathA period of at least seven days has passed since symptoms first appearedIf they have access to testing, the criteria includes two consecutive tests that are negative and 24 hours apart, along with no longer having a fever and seeing improvement in symptoms.Recovered doesn't mean that a patient immediately returns to feeling healthy. Hota said that many of his patients feel tired and still have a lingering cough even if they meet the recovery criteria."Recovery ... can take some time," Hota said.It can take several weeks to fully recover from illness caused by the novel coronavirus, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, said during a briefing in Geneva in early March."It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease," Ryan said. "People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness."Ryan added that recovery is often measured as the patient no longer exhibiting symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests for the virus at least one day apart — but some countries may measure "recovery" differently.Also, confirming recovery can differ from confirming whether someone is still carrying the virus — and that's where some confusion may emerge.How long can the virus linger in the body?Estimates have ranged regarding how long the coronavirus may linger in the body.One paper published in the medical journal JAMA in February tracked the recovery of four medical professionals in Wuhan, China, who were confirmed to have COVID-19. One was hospitalized and the three others were quarantined, but they were all treated at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in January and February.The paper found that traces of the novel coronavirus still could be detected in all four patients up to 13 days after their symptoms had ended and they met criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine."Further studies should follow up patients who are not health care professionals and who have more severe infection after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine," the researchers wrote in that paper.A separate study, published in The Lancet medical journal in March, found that the virus might be detected for up to 37 days in patients who recover from COVID-19.That study included data on 191 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan who had either been discharged from the hospital or died by the end of January.The data showed that among the survivors, the median duration of which the virus could be detected was 20 days from the onset of their illness. The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was eight days and the longest was 37 days, the researchers found.Among those who died, the researchers found that "the virus was continuously detectable until death." The researchers wrote in the study, "sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors."Overall, Rush University Medical Center's Hota, who was not involved in either study, has cautioned against thinking someone who tests positive for the virus is also infectious.The CDC notes that COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact between people in respiratory droplets, such as droplets that come from coughs or sneezes. While people who are infected often have symptoms of illness, the CDC warns that some people without symptoms also may be able to spread the virus.Specifically, testing "doesn't give you any information if that virus is what we call viable or can live and can cause subsequent infections," Hota said. "So the testing can detect the genetic material, but it doesn't mean that somebody's necessarily still infectious."

Most people with COVID-19 have  mild illness  and are able to recover at home without medical care, while severe cases often receive supportive care in the hospital, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"At an individual level, if people can know if they were asymptomatically or mildly infected and recovered, they can know that they are immune and can safely return to work once the shelter at home is eliminated."                                                                                                                           Does getting coronavirus once mean you are immune?                          There's no evidence to date that people who recover from COVID-19 can get re-infected with the novel coronavirus — though there isn't a lot of data in general, Hota said. He added that identifying those who recover could help indicate those who have built immunity, at least in the short term. "This is a little bit of an understudied group," Hota said about recovered COVID-19 patients. "Being able to [identify recovered patients]...and say you've been exposed, you've recovered, and we believe you're immune, I think that'll be very powerful." 'Recovery ... can take some time' Currently there is no treatment for COVID-19 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but those infected can recover with appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms. The CDC has noted that for those with COVID-19 isolated at home, they are  considered recovered  if they meet three criteria: No fever for at least 72 hours without using fever-reducing medications Improvement in other coronavirus-related symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath A period of at least seven days has passed since symptoms first appeared If they have access to testing, the criteria includes two consecutive tests that are negative and 24 hours apart, along with no longer having a fever and seeing improvement in symptoms. Recovered doesn't mean that a patient immediately returns to feeling healthy. Hota said that many of his patients feel tired and still have a lingering cough even if they meet the recovery criteria. "Recovery ... can take some time," Hota said.                                                                                                                      Could plasma from recovered coronavirus patients help cure the sick?                          It can take several weeks to fully recover from illness caused by the novel coronavirus, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, said during a briefing in Geneva in early March. "It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease," Ryan said. "People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness." Ryan added that recovery is often measured as the patient no longer exhibiting symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests for the virus at least one day apart — but some countries may measure "recovery" differently. Also, confirming recovery can differ from confirming whether someone is still carrying the virus — and that's where some confusion may emerge. How long can the virus linger in the body? Estimates have ranged regarding how long the coronavirus may linger in the body. One  paper  published in the medical journal JAMA in February tracked the recovery of four medical professionals in Wuhan, China, who were confirmed to have COVID-19. One was hospitalized and the three others were quarantined, but they were all treated at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in January and February. The paper found that traces of the novel coronavirus still could be detected in all four patients up to 13 days after their symptoms had ended and they met criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine. "Further studies should follow up patients who are not health care professionals and who have more severe infection after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine," the researchers wrote in that paper.                                                                                                                           Children's coronavirus cases are not as severe, but that doesn't make them less serious                          A separate  study , published in The Lancet medical journal in March, found that the virus might be detected for up to 37 days in patients who recover from COVID-19. That study included data on 191 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan who had either been discharged from the hospital or died by the end of January. The data showed that among the survivors, the median duration of which the virus could be detected was 20 days from the onset of their illness. The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was eight days and the longest was 37 days, the researchers found. Among those who died, the researchers found that "the virus was continuously detectable until death." The researchers wrote in the study, "sustained viral detection in throat samples was observed in both survivors and non-survivors."                                                                                                            New estimates show 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don't even have symptoms and can infect others blindly                          Overall, Rush University Medical Center's Hota, who was not involved in either study, has cautioned against thinking someone who tests positive for the virus is also infectious. The CDC notes that COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through  close contact  between people in respiratory droplets, such as droplets that come from coughs or sneezes. While people who are infected often have symptoms of illness, the CDC warns that some people without symptoms also may be able to spread the virus. Specifically, testing "doesn't give you any information if that virus is what we call viable or can live and can cause subsequent infections," Hota said. "So the testing can detect the genetic material, but it doesn't mean that somebody's necessarily still infectious."

As COVID-19 forces people to stay home, many are baking to fill the time and to feed their families.Pastry chef Mitchell Moore is using social media to teach families to bake bread. Moore, owner of Campbell’s Bakery and Campbell’s Craft Donuts, said necessity led him to conduct the Facebook Live cooking lessons.“I was seeing people do something because they need it, which was bake bread, because you just can’t find it (at the store),” Moore said. Moore said people had called him asking to buy yeast to make bread. He decided there was another way to help.“You don’t have to have yeast to make bread. You have wild yeast to make sourdough, and they asked, ‘Well, how do you do that?’” Moore said.The chef pushed the live button on Facebook and dozens tuned in to learn.“There’s something special about feeding your family something you literally made,” Moore said. Moore said he has enjoyed seeing people bake with their families and even incorporate his videos into daily home school lessons. He hopes that when life returns to normal, families will continue to spend time together in the kitchen.“There are studies that show that a dinner time, a set dinner time, can influence people even into their adulthood, so yeah, I hope people continue,” Moore said.The bread tutorials are posted on the Campbell’s Bakery Facebook page.

CDC now recommends wearing non-medical face coverings to help slow coronavirus spread
.W
President Donald Trump said the face coverings could be made at home and washed and reused.

President Donald Trump has detailed a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that Americans wear face coverings in an effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.Federal health officials are suggesting that non-medical masks and face coverings be used to cover the nose and mouth when outside the home — for instance, at the grocery store or pharmacy — when social distancing is difficult to maintain.“The CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks," President Donald Trump said Friday at a coronavirus task force meeting, noting the country wants those medical and surgical grade masks to be used for health care workers.Trump said the voluntary measure could use basic cloth or fabric, which could be made at home and washed and reused.The president stressed that the recommendation is optional and is conceding he will not be adhering to it.In response to recent studies, the CDC on Wednesday also changed how it was defining the risk of infection for Americans. It essentially says anyone may be a considered a carrier, whether they have symptoms or not.The virus spreads mostly through droplets from coughs or sneezes, though experts stress that the germ is still not fully understood. U.S. officials have been telling people to stay at home as much as possible, and keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others when they do go out. Other advice includes frequent hand washing and not touching your face.But until now federal officials have stopped short of telling people to cover their faces out in public.Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Thursday that officials don’t want people to get a false sense of security with a mask because of asymptomatic carriers and the problem of touching your face in connection with wearing a mask.CDC director Robert Redfield said Friday social distancing is a powerful tool. He said that’s the first and foremost approach because the virus can’t spread from one to another six feet away.He said they’re constantly looking at new data and added that a face interrupter can help.Scientists can’t rule out that infected people sometimes exhale COVID-19 virus particles, rather than just when coughing or sneezing, but there isn’t enough evidence to show if that can cause infection, according to a committee convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to advise the White House.Video: Woman sews hundreds of face masks for nursesThe question has to do with whether the new coronavirus spreads mostly by droplets that don’t linger for long in the air, or also by tinier “aerosolized” particles. Certain medical procedures, such as inserting breathing tubes, can create those tiny particles, which is why health care workers wear close-fitting N95 masks during such care.The committee cited one study that detected airborne viral RNA in and just outside some hospital isolation rooms, but noted that it was unclear if that could infect someone.U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams had repeatedly admonished Americans not to wear face masks, saying they don’t prevent the people who wear them from catching the virus. He and other officials have stressed that surgical face masks and other protective medical equipment have been in short supply and must be prioritized for people such as health-care workers.Adams explained Friday how the issue has evolved.He said we know now from recent research that the virus can spread from people in close proximity, such as by coughing, sneezing or speaking, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms.The surgeon general also said that using the face coverings could help others.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday defended Crozier's removal, saying the move is an example of how "we hold leaders accountable for their actions."

The Navy captain removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt last week after warning that action was needed to save the lives of his crew from a coronavirus outbreak has tested positive for the virus, according to The New York Times on Sunday.Capt.

The Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now restricting cruise ship passengers and crew arriving in the U.S. from boarding domestic commercial flights.

The Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now restricting cruise ship passengers and crew arriving in the U.S. from boarding domestic commercial flights.The restrictions will apply even to people not showing symptoms and also would require 14-day quarantines for cruise passengers and crew. An administration official said these new protocols would likely be agreements between cruise ship companies and the government, requiring that they be followed in order for these ships to dock at specific ports.That official added that there could be a range of exceptions and specific circumstances that would divert from the new protocols, specifically as it relates to foreigners on the ships.This comes after hundreds of arriving Holland America Line cruise passengers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week were allowed to fly on commercial airliners, raising concerns from other fliers.The CDC and Florida officials said disembarking passengers were screened before being allowed to leave ports of entry. Sick passengers remained in Florida.Related video: Canceled vacation leads to virtual cruiseThese new restrictions will limit cruise passengers and crew to flying on charter aircraft or using private transportation.One of the first ships that would be affected by the new rules would be one operated by Princess Cruises.A spokesperson for Carnival Corporation (parent company of Princess Cruises) told CNN, "Princess Cruises is working around the clock to arrange small group charters and individual car transport for its U.S. guests to comply with the updated CDC guidelines in order to disembark a wide number of guests from the ship.

Using paint, this nurse demonstrates just how fast germs spread — even if you're wearing gloves
.W
In an off-the-cuff video, the nurse decided to demonstrate just how quick and easy it is to spread germs at a grocery store.

To stop the spread of coronavirus, many states are under stay-at-home orders, and travel restrictions limit where people can go.But that doesn't mean many well-meaning people may not wind up exposing themselves to germs unwittingly.On a recent trip to the grocery store, Molly Lixey, a former emergency room nurse in Saginaw, Michigan, told CNN she noticed a lot of people wearing gloves, which she thought was great.But what wasn't so great? All the cross-contamination she saw.In an off-the-cuff Facebook video, Lixey decided to demonstrate just how quick and easy it is to spread germs at a grocery store."I was doing some painting around the house and it hit me that paint would be a perfect medium to use to explain this (cross contamination)," she told CNN. "It terrifies me to think people believe they're safe only because they are wearing gloves and not have them be aware that they could still be harming themselves or others."It's known that coronavirus can spread through sneezes and coughs, and new research shows it can be passed from talking, or possibly even just breathing, which makes passing germs from object to object that much easier.In her video, Lixey simulates going to the grocery store and she starts off by putting gloves on her hands, grabbing her cell phone as she leaves her car, cleaning a shopping cart and grabbing some toilet paper. She uses a piece of cardboard as her cell phone and dips her fingers in a plate of paint to symbolize the germs on her hands as a result of grabbing toilet paper."But it's (the germs) on my gloves, that's fine right? It's on my gloves," she said in the video. "But now I'm walking along and my phone rings, so I've now touched my hands together a couple times, I reach for my phone and, 'Oh I have a text message from my husband.'"Lixey continues to pretend she's walking through the grocery store and as she imitates picking up new items to put in her cart, she dips her fingers back into the paint to mimic the germs she's picking up throughout this process."I understand as a nurse I have had extensive training in the use of PPE, but many people in the general public have not," she said. "They are all so fearful right now they will do anything to protect themselves, but it's important they do so properly. "Eventually, after picking up a simulated phone call, the paint winds up on her cheek, symbolizing the germs that would have traveled to her face. Even once she takes the gloves off, Lixey shows the paint had wound up on her makeshift phone, which she holds after taking the gloves off — ultimately resulting in cross-contamination.Her general message? "There's no point in wearing gloves, if you're not gonna wash your hands every time you touch something," she said in the video.That's because whatever gets on the gloves would migrate to the phone if someone picked it up. Then unless the person disinfects the phone, the germs on it would travel to his or her hand once the gloves were off and the person touched the device.Lixey currently works inside an infusion clinic at a doctor's office. She said if the virus continues to spread in her area more, she will go back to working in a hospital setting.She isn't the only one taking to social media to educate on the importance of understanding how germs spread.Related video: Is coronavirus airborne? The answer may not be so simpleHays Earls, a registered nurse in Dallas, Texas, made a TikTok video of an experiment she did to show her three-year-old son how germs stick to our hands and how washing them with soap removes them.In the video, Earls' son dips his finger into a bowl of water with pepper sprinkled on the top. When he takes his finger out, it's covered in pepper, simulating how germs cling to skin. She then pumps some soap on a clean finger and as he dips that into the bowl, the pepper spreads away from his finger.Earls said she's happy to pass the experiment onto other parents and that the visual lesson worked with her son.

What percent of people in the US and world could get coronavirus?

Health experts have cited projections about what percentage of people could get infected. Here's what you need to know.

Above video: What to do if you think you have coronavirus, according to the CDCIt's been a sporadic week in the United States as coronavirus deaths have increased within days from one to 14 people nationwide.There are now over 200 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States alone, and that may go up as testing becomes more accessible.Here are key things to know about the spread of the virus:What percent of the US population could get coronavirus?“Because there’s no population immunity, we are going to see a lot of infections in the United States; maybe, you know, over 40% of the population may become infected with this virus,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert connected to Johns Hopkins University, said Monday.“But you have to remember for the vast, vast majority of people who get this, it is going to be like a severe flu. It is not going to be life-threatening. Most cases are going to be mild and not require hospitalization.”He also added, “Almost all cases are going to recover.”What percent of the world could get coronavirus?Figures have been cited by experts, but they’ve also come with criticism.In February, Gabriel Leung, a Hong Kong public health epidemiologist, told The Guardian that the virus could affect two-thirds of the global population.But a World Health Organization official, Mike Ryan, challenged that figure, saying to be "careful in throwing around figures, speculation and scaring people.""So I'd just caution everybody to not start throwing around figures that there is no basis for at the moment," he also said in February.Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University epidemiologist, told CBS News on Monday that based on mathematical models, it's projected that 40% to 70% of the world’s population could get infected. He said he thinks that projection is likely to become a reality.The number of affected states is growingThe confirmed coronavirus cases are spread out across the U.S.Washington state has the largest number at 70 confirmed cases, including 13 deaths. California has 49 infections, including one fatality. New York has 22 positive cases, Illinois has five, Texas and Florida both have four, and the remaining states have three or fewer cases.In New York alone, more than 2,500 people have been ordered to self-quarantine as health officials search for anyone who may have been exposed to the virus.WHO warns governments 'this is not a drill'The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned governments that the continued international spread of the novel coronavirus is "not a drill" and will require significant action if public health authorities are to contain the deadly outbreak.The call to action comes as the global number of people infected by the virus nears 100,000 — a grim milestone that now appears inevitable with self-sustaining clusters continuing to expand in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.

Here's how schools are preparing for the coronavirus
.W
School districts are getting ready for the possibility their own communities will see confirmed cases of the coronavirus.

As communities across the United States prepare for the novel coronavirus, many are wondering how schools plan to respond.Millions of students in China, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Italy and elsewhere have been impacted by school closures in recent weeks in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.And fears of an outbreak in the United States have already prompted a handful of school closures in the Northwest, including at Jackson High School in Snohomish County, Washington, where a boy tested positive for the coronavirus. The school was closed Monday for cleaning.In Bothell, Washington, just north of Seattle, the Northshore School District announced it would close all of its schools for up to 14 days due to the spread of the virus. Bothell High School was closed for cleaning when a staffer's relative was tested for the coronavirus. That test ultimately came back negative."I believe that the time has come for our district community to make an important shift," Northshore's superintendent Dr. Michelle Reid said in a statement announcing the closure. "This decision was made thoughtfully and with the support of a variety of district and community leaders."An elementary school in Lake Oswego, Oregon, was also closed through Wednesday for cleaning after an employee tested positive. But it could be a sign of what's to come, and now, school districts are preparing for the possibility their own communities will see confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Here's how they're getting ready.Many are focused on prevention and communication ...Schools and districts across the country have said they're in touch with their state and local health departments, which will advise school officials on best practices and next steps as the outbreak goes on.Much of what school officials have said is common sense and applicable not just to Covid-19 — the World Health Organization's name for the disease caused by the coronavirus — but also to a more familiar threat: the flu.The coronavirus is spreading "at a time when school nurses are already dealing with the flu season," said Donna Mazyck, executive director of the National Association of School Nurses. And like they would every flu season, schools and nurses are focused on promoting prevention, Mazyck said.Those prevention methods include the basics, such as washing your hands for at least 20 seconds several times a day and staying home when you're sick. Students and teachers should avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouths to keep from spreading germs, and schools should wash and disinfect high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs and desktops.Communication — not only with health officials but with students and families as well — is critical, Mazyck said. School nurses in particular can help alleviate unnecessary anxiety, she said, especially when families have the news on repeat."Children respond to that," she said.Students and families should get the facts, she said. But it's important to keep "the conversation on what we can do rather than perseverating on information that doesn't change but can cause fear."... and reviewing response plansAdditionally, school districts are working to review and update their infectious disease response plans, Mazyck said.Schools often already have these plans in place, Mazyck said. The 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic prompted many schools to review and implement some protocols, but these plans are often reviewed for flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a planning checklist specifically for school administrators, Mazyck said.If a sick student does come to the nurse's office, he or she will do what they always do. The nurse will check the students' symptoms before referring them to their primary care provider, Mazyck said."They'll also note whether those symptoms are matching those related to Covid-19 exposure," she said. That information would likely be shared with the local health department, she added.Additional school closures are possibleSome schools may be forced to implement social distancing in an effort to prevent an outbreak. In a classroom setting, that could mean spreading students out. A 2017 CDC document suggested dividing classes into smaller groups and rearranging desks so students were at least 3 feet from each other. But social distancing could also mean isolating a sick student or closing a school entirely."The key here is to isolate individuals who are infected to protect others from getting it," said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association."And that's where schools have a problem," he added. "Classrooms are basically incubators for viruses."These decisions would be made with the help of health authorities, he said, who have knowledge and expertise that district superintendents will lean on, particularly when or if a case is identified in a school."Those are difficult decisions that need to be made in conjunction with health organizations," Domenech said.School closures are generally decided based on a percentage of absenteeism among staff and the student body, Mazyck said. But officials will take a variety of factors into account before closing a school."You'd look at disease severity," she said. "That's how many people are sick, what's going on in that community where schools are located and in the school itself.""And then decisions are made based on the impact of disease on the school staff and the students we may feel like are vulnerable or maybe at higher risk for Covid-19," she said.Online schoolingThe possibility of closures also raises questions about how schools can continue teaching students without a prolonged interruption.One of the benefits unavailable at the time of the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic is today's technology, Domenech said. Many school districts have laptop computers for students to take home, he said, making it easier for them to continue their learning online.Miami-Dade County Public Schools announced earlier this week it has as many as 200,000 electronic devices it can distribute to students in the event of school closures."If we have to shut down a school for any reason — and that's a measure of last resort — or isolate classrooms of students where they would have to stay home, we are able to empower those students and families with devices with digital content so their education continues from a distance," Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said.Of course not all neighborhoods and school districts have the resources Miami-Dade has, and students may not have reliable access to the internet or a computer to learn online.In many of those cases, Domenech said, schools will prepare instructional packets — "The old paper and pencil, if you can imagine," he said — for students to take home.There will be challengesClosures could be difficult for parents, Domenech said, who would likely have to stay home with students or have someone else stay home, because sending them to daycare would defeat the purpose of a school closure.Students from low-income areas might also rely on school meal programs for meals. But school districts' emergency response plans likely include an alternative, such as connecting with community groups that can help, Mazyck said."I saw that happen during the H1N1 epidemic and pandemic," Mazyck said. "Because those school administrators know their populations, they made provisions for children who would be missing their food because schools had to close for health reasons."Districts will likely keep these challenges in mind, but ultimately containing the coronavirus will win out."Some of these decisions are going to be tough and going to be hard," Domenech said. "But again, if we're talking about an epidemic and containing the spread of an epidemic, those are the things that are going to have to happen."                        As communities across the United States prepare for the novel coronavirus, many are wondering how schools plan to respond. Millions of students in China, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Italy and elsewhere have been impacted by school closures in recent weeks in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

An elementary school in Lake Oswego, Oregon, was also closed through Wednesday for cleaning after an employee tested positive.  But it could be a sign of what's to come, and now, school districts are preparing for the possibility their own communities will see confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Here's how they're getting ready. Many are focused on prevention and communication ... Schools and districts across the country have said they're in touch with their state and local health departments, which will advise school officials on best practices and next steps as the outbreak goes on. Much of what school officials have said is common sense and applicable not just to Covid-19 — the World Health Organization's name for the disease caused by the coronavirus — but also to a more familiar threat: the flu. The coronavirus is spreading "at a time when school nurses are already dealing with the flu season," said Donna Mazyck, executive director of the National Association of School Nurses. And like they would every flu season, schools and nurses are focused on promoting prevention, Mazyck said. Those prevention methods include the basics, such as washing your hands for at least 20 seconds several times a day and staying home when you're sick. Students and teachers should avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouths to keep from spreading germs, and schools should wash and disinfect high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs and desktops.                                                                                                            The best prevention against the coronavirus is still washing your hands. Here's the proper way to do it                          Communication — not only with health officials but with students and families as well — is critical, Mazyck said. School nurses in particular can help alleviate unnecessary anxiety, she said, especially when families have the news on repeat. "Children respond to that," she said. Students and families should get the facts, she said. But it's important to keep "the conversation on what we can do rather than perseverating on information that doesn't change but can cause fear." ... and reviewing response plans Additionally, school districts are working to review and update their infectious disease response plans, Mazyck said. Schools often already have these plans in place, Mazyck said. The 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic prompted many schools to review and implement some protocols, but these plans are often reviewed for flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a planning checklist specifically for school administrators, Mazyck said. If a sick student does come to the nurse's office, he or she will do what they always do. The nurse will check the students' symptoms before referring them to their primary care provider, Mazyck said. "They'll also note whether those symptoms are matching those related to Covid-19 exposure," she said. That information would likely be shared with the local health department, she added. Additional school closures are possible Some schools may be forced to implement social distancing in an effort to prevent an outbreak. In a classroom setting, that could mean spreading students out. A 2017 CDC document suggested dividing classes into smaller groups and rearranging desks so students were at least 3 feet from each other. But social distancing could also mean isolating a sick student or closing a school entirely. "The key here is to isolate individuals who are infected to protect others from getting it," said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association. "And that's where schools have a problem," he added. "Classrooms are basically incubators for viruses." These decisions would be made with the help of health authorities, he said, who have knowledge and expertise that district superintendents will lean on, particularly when or if a case is identified in a school. "Those are difficult decisions that need to be made in conjunction with health organizations," Domenech said. School closures are generally decided based on a percentage of absenteeism among staff and the student body, Mazyck said. But officials will take a variety of factors into account before closing a school. "You'd look at disease severity," she said. "That's how many people are sick, what's going on in that community where schools are located and in the school itself." "And then decisions are made based on the impact of disease on the school staff and the students we may feel like are vulnerable or maybe at higher risk for Covid-19," she said.                                                                                                            Here's who is most likely to get coronavirus and how it compares to other diseases                          Online schooling The possibility of closures also raises questions about how schools can continue teaching students without a prolonged interruption. One of the benefits unavailable at the time of the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic is today's technology, Domenech said. Many school districts have laptop computers for students to take home, he said, making it easier for them to continue their learning online. Miami-Dade County Public Schools announced earlier this week it has as many as 200,000 electronic devices it can distribute to students in the event of school closures. "If we have to shut down a school for any reason — and that's a measure of last resort — or isolate classrooms of students where they would have to stay home, we are able to empower those students and families with devices with digital content so their education continues from a distance," Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. Of course not all neighborhoods and school districts have the resources Miami-Dade has, and students may not have reliable access to the internet or a computer to learn online. In many of those cases, Domenech said, schools will prepare instructional packets — "The old paper and pencil, if you can imagine," he said — for students to take home. There will be challenges Closures could be difficult for parents, Domenech said, who would likely have to stay home with students or have someone else stay home, because sending them to daycare would defeat the purpose of a school closure. Students from low-income areas might also rely on school meal programs for meals. But school districts' emergency response plans likely include an alternative, such as connecting with community groups that can help, Mazyck said. "I saw that happen during the H1N1 epidemic and pandemic," Mazyck said. "Because those school administrators know their populations, they made provisions for children who would be missing their food because schools had to close for health reasons." Districts will likely keep these challenges in mind, but ultimately containing the coronavirus will win out. "Some of these decisions are going to be tough and going to be hard," Domenech said. "But again, if we're talking about an epidemic and containing the spread of an epidemic, those are the things that are going to have to happen."

Fact Check: Coronavirus prank falsely tells of workplace, school closings
.W
Facebook posts, evidently intended as a prank, erroneously claim that the government — or specific states such as Michigan or Florida — has mandated that employers and schools close for two weeks in response to the coronavirus. No such announcement has been made.

Posted on March 5, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.Complete with “BREAKING NEWS” graphics, viral Facebook text posts are spreading a falsehood about a government mandate requiring workplaces and schools to close in order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.The posts are apparently intended to be part of a joke, though users have to click the link at the bottom to get the punchline.“The Government have announced measures that all workplaces with 10 employees or more are to have paid mandatory leave to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus starting from March 6, 2020,” the posts read. “All schools are to close for 2 weeks also from March 6th … Offices will resume after 2 weeks of the mandatory closure. A list of all schools and businesses in your area is shown on the list.”The link to the “full article” included in the post, however, is actually a link for a photo of a gorilla giving the middle finger.A different iteration of the same claim attributed the announcement to CNN and listed the start date of the closings as March 9. Others switched out the vague “government” reference to make the claim specific to Michigan, Florida, Alabama and other states.Some commenters expressed an understanding of the joke, but the viral posts — amid a steady flow of coronavirus-related misinformation — nevertheless stand to mislead Facebook users as the U.S. grapples with the coronavirus.We could find no evidence of the federal government or any state announcing any such requirements thus far. Some schools — including in Washington, Oregon and Rhode Island — were prompted to temporarily close due to the coronavirus, but not because of statewide mandates. And the U.S. Department of Education’s current interim guidance for schools does not call for mandatory two-week closings; it encourages schools to make decisions with local officials, noting that dismissals “may be recommended for 14 days, or possibly longer if advised by local health officials.”At least some of the states referenced in the posts, including Michigan and Alabama, had no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus as of March 5, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — though that could change as the outbreak unfolds.Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that there is “not a recommendation in Michigan that schools or businesses close at this time.” She added that the state’s information and recommendations regarding the virus can be found at michigan.gov/coronavirus.Many states, including Alabama and Florida, have set up similar pages for state-specific information related to the new coronavirus.

Fact Check: President Trump and the coronavirus death rate
.W
President Trump says the true coronavirus death rate is much lower because the World Health Organization rate does not take into account unreported cases. The WHO rate comes from the actual number of known cases and fatalities.

Posted March 5, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.The World Health Organization says that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died – a global fatality figure that President Donald Trump dismissed as “a false number.” It’s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%.Trump says the true rate is much lower because the WHO’s rate does not take into account unreported cases. The WHO rate comes from the actual number of known cases and fatalities.The dispute began March 3 when the head of the WHO announced that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus was 3.4%, which was higher than previously believed and made it far more deadly than the seasonal flu.“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 (the disease spread by the virus) cases have died,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a briefing. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.”He said there had been 90,893 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3,110 deaths.Trump challenged that number. “Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,” Trump said in a telephone interview March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.The problem, the president said, was that many people with mild cases of coronavirus simply weren’t being counted, resulting in a deceptively high figure for the percentage who have died.Trump, March 4: Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and — or virus. So you just can’t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California — I believe you had one in New York — you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to — as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don’t — they don’t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital. They don’t report to doctors or the hospital in many cases.The actual mortality rate, Trump said, “is way under 1%.”For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told us in a January email.A number of disease experts agree with Trump that there are many unreported cases and that the rate reported by the WHO is higher than the rate will end up being over time. It’s relatively easy to know how many people have died from the disease. But it takes a while to have a fuller sense of how many people have it, for the reason Trump cited — they have a mild case and haven’t sought treatment — or because they don’t even know they have it. And very little testing has been done. In other words, experts say, we have the numerator but not the denominator.In time, and once much more testing has been carried out, the rate will fall, they say. But one WHO expert who visited China doesn’t think there are that many undiagnosed cases.Vaccine expert Paul A. Offit told us the rate could go below 1% as Trump says. “I think Trump is right,” said Offit, who holds the Maurice R. Hilleman Chair of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania.Offit likens the situation to the swine flu epidemic of 2009. At one point, he said, the mortality rate was thought to be much higher than the 0.01 to 0.03% it turned out to be. He thinks the mortality rate for coronavirus will similarly plummet and the “false notion that it is more likely to kill you than influenza” will disappear.Offit believes there has been a “wild overreaction” to the disease, in part because it is new. “We’re more the victim of fear than the virus,” he said.Other experts agree that mortality rates at this point in an outbreak are wobbly since its full extent is not known. Fisman told us in January that statistics at the time might not tell the full story. He said it was likely far more people had been infected, but had not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. At the same time, he pointed out that some of the people who are sick might die, pushing the rate in the other direction.Gary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, told the health website STAT in February that it would be highly unusual if there weren’t mild cases that had been missed. The website’s article said: “He pointed to the fact that outbreaks have popped up in countries far from China — including Iran and Italy — because people with mild infections were not detected and traveled to other places.“There are mild cases that are undetected. This is why it’s spreading. Otherwise it would not be spreading because we would know where those cases are and they would be contained and that would be the end of it,” Kobinger told STAT.But there is by no means unanimity on the subject. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist who led a WHO team to inspect China’s response to coronavirus, doesn’t believe there are nearly as many undiagnosed cases as other scientists do.“There is no evidence that we’re seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus,” he told the New York Times. “What we’re seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.”In Guangdong, he said, “they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province.” He concluded, “Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I’ll be saying, ‘Guess what? Those data didn’t tell us the story.’ But the data we have now don’t support it.”A Feb. 28 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, took the position that the mortality rate may well fall dramatically. It said if one assumed that there were several times as many people who had the disease with minimal or no symptoms as the number of reported cases, the mortality rate may be considerably less than 1%. That would suggest “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza,” the editorial said. After the WHO announced the 3.4% mortality rate, a number of medical experts asserted that the rate would shrink over time.“When we see systems that are able to account for not only the really sick, but also those who have infection and are outpatients, the CFR  is more accurate and drops considerably,” Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said in an interview with the website Vox. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, had a similar view. He told Vox, “To get a rate, you need the deaths — which you can more reliably pick up — and you need cases, which you can less reliably pick up. It’s not irresponsible to come out with that number, but it should have been more clearly interpreted as not being reliable, or at least mention it’ll vary in regions.”A February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of cases in China found a mortality rate of 2.3%. But the new coronavirus hit the elderly particularly hard: The rate was 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79.

Fact Check: Pope Francis does not have coronavirus
.W
An article circulating on social media claims without evidence that Pope Francis and two of his aides have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The Vatican has said the pope has a cold, “with no symptoms related to other pathologies.”

Posted on March 5, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.An article circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Pope Francis and two of his Vatican aides have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The article, which originally appeared on the website MCM News, also includes photos of Francis looking visibly ill, blowing his nose and coughing during a Mass in Rome on Ash Wednesday.The Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported on March 3 that the pope has been tested for the coronavirus and that his results were negative. Il Messaggero does not list a source for the information about test results, but multiple news outlets have since repeated the claim, citing the Il Messaggero article. The Vatican has not verified any of these claims, nor has it disclosed whether or not the pope was tested for the coronavirus.Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement on March 3 saying, “The cold the Holy Father was diagnosed with recently is running its course, with no symptoms related to other pathologies.”“In the meantime, Pope Francis celebrates Mass daily and is following the spiritual exercises taking place at the Divine Master House in Ariccia,” Bruni said, referring to the Lenten retreat.Speculation regarding the pope’s health began after he cancelled his participation in the weeklong retreat in the Roman countryside.

Posted on March 5, 2020                                                                                                  FactCheck.org                                                    Advertisement                       We are collaborating with  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts. An  article  circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Pope Francis and two of his Vatican aides have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The article, which originally appeared on the website MCM News, also includes photos of Francis looking visibly ill, blowing his nose and coughing during a Mass in Rome on  Ash Wednesday . The Italian newspaper  Il Messaggero   reported  on March 3 that the pope has been tested for the coronavirus and that his results were negative.  Il Messaggero  does not list a source for the information about test results,  but  multiple   news   outlets  have since repeated the claim, citing the  Il Messaggero  article.  The Vatican has not verified any of these claims, nor has it disclosed whether or not the pope was tested for the coronavirus. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement on March 3  saying,  “The cold the Holy Father was diagnosed with recently is running its course, with no symptoms related to other pathologies.” “In the meantime, Pope Francis celebrates Mass daily and is  following  the spiritual exercises taking place at the Divine Master House in Ariccia,” Bruni said, referring to the Lenten retreat. Speculation regarding the pope’s health began after he  cancelled  his participation in the weeklong retreat in the Roman countryside.

Ten days later, the facility said it began requiring staff to wear masks and other personal protective equipment.Andrew Faron noticed his dad looked a little tired."He started running a temperature on Tuesday. They ran a test on Wednesday. It came back positive on Thursday and he died on Friday morning," Andrew Faron said. Andrew Faron said it happened so quickly they had no time to prepare."My dad was doing fine two weeks ago. He was playing bingo, he was going to the dining room and eating with his friends,” Andrew Faron said.Andrew Faron said Walter, 86, had dementia and colon cancer, but it was progressing slowly. The Douglas County Health Department said Walter Faron had "several comorbidities but it has been determined that his acute cause of death was due to the COVID-19 virus."Health officials believes a staff member brought it into the facility, not knowing they were sick."It’s not just the people that are on the front lines that need to take it seriously, it’s the people that are in long-term care facilities as well,” Andrew Faron said.Andrew Faron is heartbroken knowing the virus took his dad. Now, he has a warning.“I want people to know how quickly this moves,” Andrew Faron said.He hopes people will stay home to protect others.“This is not anything to joke about. It’s not a passing fad, this is a serious thing,” Andrew Faron said.Andrew Faron said his dad was an Air Force veteran, and that he was a great man.The family is waiting to hold a funeral until they're able to safely gather again.

A man who was diagnosed with coronavirus and recovered has donated his plasma to try to help others.

A California man who was diagnosed with the coronavirus and recovered has donated his plasma to help others fighting the potentially deadly virus.On March 6, Jason Garcia noticed he had a mild cough and some congestion.The 36-year-old aerospace engineer from Escondido, California, didn't think that much of it. But later while on a work trip, he noticed a headache had begun accompanying his cough. Within a day, he also had a fever and body aches that quickly came and went. Then he began experiencing shortness of breath.Garcia called his doctor and based on his symptoms was told to go to the hospital and get tested for coronavirus.A positive test resultHe was sent home and received a call on March 14 letting him know he had tested positive."They said stay isolated," Garcia said. "That's what I did."He spent nearly 10 days inside his home, confined to his office or his guest room, staying away from his active-duty Navy wife and their 11-month-old daughter.He started to feel better, and on March 18, he said he considered himself "symptom free."He received a letter from the county of San Diego saying that it was safe for him to come out of isolation and rejoined the world on March 23.Garcia said although the protocol for coming out of isolation was 72 hours without symptoms, he wanted to be extra careful. "I decided to do five days just to be safe," he said.Victory over the virusTo celebrate his recovery, he posted on social media to let his friends know he had been infected with coronavirus and was better.Garcia said he wrote: "I claimed victory over this deadly virus. I won over COVID-19."Around the same time, health officials at St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange County, California, also took to social media to say they were looking for someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus and had recovered to help with an experimental treatment to potentially save the life of another coronavirus patient.A friend who saw both social media posts reached out and the hospital called Garcia just a few days after his quarantine had ended, he said.A potentially lifesaving donationThey asked him for a plasma donation to be given to a coronavirus patient who was in dire condition and unresponsive to other treatments, Garcia said.He said yes. "This can be turned into a lifesaving opportunity for someone who can't fight off this disease," Garcia said.The plasma donation will allow the current coronavirus patient to receive antibodies from Garcia, a recovered patient, to help fight off the virus, Wendy Escobedo, director of nursing for renal services at St. Joseph's Hospital said in a video provided by the hospital.On April 1, Garcia donated his plasma for experimental transfer into three patients.As of Sunday, he said, doctors told him that all of his plasma has been donated. The patient who was in the worst condition has since improved, Garcia said doctors told him.The patient was taken off some medication, is healthier in terms of oxygenation and is doing incrementally better day-by-day, a spokesperson for the hospital told CNN in an email late Sunday night."When I was diagnosed, the feeling of dread and fear, the fact this was a positive," Garcia explained. "This thing ended up possibly saving someone's life."Although Garcia doesn't know how he became infected with the virus, he's glad he might contribute to a treatment until a vaccine is ready."If this works, there's going to be an awesome chance for people to save a lot of heartache for others and fight the fight for their lives."

Watchdog report finds severe shortages and significant challenges to hospitals' coronavirus responses
.W
The findings by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services describe a dire situation for front-line doctors and medical staff as cases mount in hospitals.

The nation's hospitals are dealing with "severe" and "widespread" shortages of needed medical supplies, hampering their ability to test and respond to the coronavirus pandemic adequately and protect medical staff, according to a new report from a government inspector general.The findings by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services describe a dire situation for front-line doctors and medical staff as cases mount in hospitals.The assessment, the first internal government look at the response, was based on interviews from March 23-27 with administrators from more than 300 hospitals across 46 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.The report provides an accounting of the shortages faced by hospitals nationwide in trying to obtain equipment for staff and patients, including the avenues some hospitals turned to to acquire those items, like online retailers and paint stores. It also details the challenges hospitals faced in trying to keep up with testing demands and the inconsistent guidance that caused confusion.The report is not a review of the Health and Human Service Department's response to the coronavirus outbreak and acknowledges the pandemic is "fast-moving, as are the efforts to address it." "Since our interviews, some hospital challenges may have worsened and others may have improved," the report states.Still, multiple media reports have revealed the obstacles before hospitals in trying to protect their own staff, while also treating an onslaught of patients. Among those obstacles has been the lack of testing.According to the HHS IG report, the shortage of testing supplies, coupled with delays in results, led to patients staying in beds longer, staff using personal protective equipment that they may not have needed to use, and staff possibly exposing themselves to patients with the virus without knowing.Hospitals reported waiting seven days or longer for test results, the HHS IG found. One hospital said 24 hours would usually be considered an extensive wait time for virus testing."An administrator at another hospital noted that the sooner the hospital knows whether patients are negative, the faster it can move them to a lower level of care that consumes fewer resources," the report reads. "As one administrator put it, 'sitting with 60 patients with presumed positives in our hospital isn't healthy for anybody.'"While some hospitals found success in getting results more quickly by using commercial labs or public sources, others continued to experience inconsistent turnaround times, the report says. The effect was hospitals unable to advise patients on how long they should self-quarantine or undertake other measures, pending results.Hospitals were simultaneously competing for other limited supplies, like personal protective equipment and ventilators. One administrator stated that their hospital's purchaser was reporting delays of 3-6 months to replenish supplies, like surgical and N95 masks.Some of the supplies hospitals received were not useable. One heath system said it received 1,000 masks from federal and state governments, half of which were for children and couldn't be used by adult staff, according to the report. Another hospital reported receiving a shipment of N95 masks from a state strategic reserve, but the elastic bands had dry-rotted. And one hospital said it received two shipments from a federal agency that contained personal protective equipment that expired in 2010.The increased demand — both among health care providers and the public — has disrupted the supply chain and contributed to the delays.The administrator of one hospital said that before the coronavirus outbreak, the "hospital's medical center used around 200 masks per day and that it was now using 2,000 per day," according to the report.To try and make up for the shortfall, some facilities have considered other, nontraditional sources for personal protective equipment, like online retailers, home supply stores, paint stores, auto-body supply shops, and beauty salons.The report also highlights the shortages of ventilators. "Hospitals anticipated that ventilator shortages would pose difficult decisions about ethical allocation and liability, although at the time of our survey no hospital reported limiting ventilator use," the report reads. One administrator said, " just don't know two weeks down the road what we will need," citing the difficulty in predicting a surge and how many ventilators would be needed.While wrestling with limited supplies, hospitals reported that they "received conflicting guidance from different government and medical authorities" on issues like criteria for testing, determining which elective procedures to delay, use of personal protection equipment, and getting supplies from the national stockpile."It's difficult when a doctor or nurse shows you legitimate information from legitimate sources and they're contradictory," one administrator told the HHS IG.Taken together, hospital administrators also expressed concern about the emotional toll the staff was taking on, both professionally and personally.As one administrator put it: "Health care workers feel like they're at war right now ...  are seeing people in their 30s, 40s, 50s dying ... This takes a large emotional toll."

Ford working with 3M, GE to make respirators and ventilators                          The report also highlights the shortages of ventilators. "Hospitals anticipated that ventilator shortages would pose difficult decisions about ethical allocation and liability, although at the time of our survey no hospital reported limiting ventilator use," the report reads. One administrator said, "[We] just don't know two weeks down the road what we will need," citing the difficulty in predicting a surge and how many ventilators would be needed. While wrestling with limited supplies, hospitals reported that they "received conflicting guidance from different government and medical authorities" on issues like criteria for testing, determining which elective procedures to delay, use of personal protection equipment, and getting supplies from the national stockpile. "It's difficult when a doctor or nurse shows you legitimate information from legitimate sources and they're contradictory," one administrator told the HHS IG. Taken together, hospital administrators also expressed concern about the emotional toll the staff was taking on, both professionally and personally.                                                                                                       A look at the emotional toll coronavirus is taking on health care workers                          As one administrator put it: "Health care workers feel like they're at war right now ... [they] are seeing people in their 30s, 40s, 50s dying ... This takes a large emotional toll."

Wisconsin governor orders delay of Tuesday's election due to coronavirus; court challenge expected
.W
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has issued an executive order to delay the state’s scheduled Tuesday presidential primary election for two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Monday issued an executive order to delay the state's presidential primary for two months because of the coronavirus pandemic, a move that will almost certainly prompt a court challenge and inject new uncertainty about whether the election will move forward.Evers, a Democrat, had previously opposed moving Tuesday's election. But he's pushing to delay it until June 9 amid criticism about how in-person voting can proceed safely at a time when public health officials are discouraging groups of people from gathering to avoid spread of the virus. Some poll sites have already closed because nervous volunteers are unwilling to staff them.Evers had been unable to strike a deal with Republicans to reschedule the election. His order comes after the GOP-controlled Legislature refused his request to cancel in-person voting on Tuesday.The Wisconsin election is being viewed as a national test case in a broader fight over voter access in the age of coronavirus with major implications for the presidential primary contests ahead — and, possibly, the November general election.The order, which Evers had previously said he didn’t have the legal authority to make, was expected to face an immediate challenge to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 5-2 by conservative justices. One of them is on the ballot Tuesday and has not participated in other election-related legal fights, narrowing the conservative majority to 4-2.The Evers order came as a separate legal fight was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.While several states had scheduled primaries in recent weeks, Wisconsin had been alone in moving ahead with in-person voting in the midst of the pandemic. Evers' earlier insistence on moving ahead was even more extraordinary given that he had issued a stay-at-home order and closed all nonessential businesses. Dozens of polling places have been closed.“Your choice is to go and vote in person and take a chance on contracting COVID-19 or stay home," Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach said. "What do you think people are going to do?”Evers and Republicans initially agreed that it was imperative for the election to proceed because thousands of local offices are on the ballot Tuesday for terms that begin in two weeks. There is also a state Supreme Court election putting the conservative incumbent against a liberal challenger.The election “must happen” because of the terms that are ending, said Republican state Rep. Ron Tusler, who tweeted over the weekend that elections continued during both the War of 1812 and the 1918 flu pandemic.Video above: Wisconsin lawmakers refuse to consider changing election The state and national Democratic parties, along with a host of other liberal and voter advocacy groups, filed federal lawsuits seeking a delay in the election and other changes. A federal court judge just last week handed Democrats a partial win, allowing for absentee ballots to be counted through April 13, delaying the reporting of election results until then. But the judge, and later a federal appeals court, declined to postpone the election.Republicans have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that it not allow absentee ballots to be counted beyond Tuesday. They argue that partial results could be leaked. The court was considering whether to take action.Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe warned clerks not to defy the federal court order and release any results before April 13. To reduce the chance of that happening, Wolfe told clerks to minimize access to vote totals and not transmit any until after 4 p.m. on April 13.Republicans want to suppress turnout, particularly in Democrat-heavy Milwaukee, because that will benefit Republicans and the conservative state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, who is seeking a 10-year term, Erpenbach said.“Democrats have always been good about getting out the vote on the day of," Erpenbach said. "If you’re looking at the newspapers, watching TV, you know right now it’s dangerous.”Meanwhile, mayors across the state, including Democrats in Wisconsin's two largest cities of Milwaukee and Madison, had urged Evers not to hold the election out of public safety concerns. Evers initially said he didn't have the legal authority to do that and had instead called on the Legislature to make it a mail-in election, as was done in Ohio.Thousands of poll workers had said they wouldn't work on Tuesday, leading Milwaukee to reduce its planned number of polling sites from 180 to just five. The National Guard was distributing supplies, including hand sanitizer, to polling sites across the state. In Madison, city workers were erecting plexiglass barriers to protect poll workers, and voters were encouraged to bring their own pens to mark the ballots.George Dunst, 76, of Madison, is the former attorney for the state elections commission who has volunteered at his local polling site for nearly every election since he retired. But he's not going on Tuesday amid fears of contracting COVID-19.“No matter what safety precautions you take, there’s going to be exposure," he said. "Who knows who comes into the polling place?”As of Monday morning, a record-high 1.2 million absentee ballots had been requested and more than 724,000 had been returned. Democrats fear that if the Supreme Court reverses the judge’s ruling and cuts short the amount of time those ballots can be returned and still counted, thousands of voters will be disenfranchised and not have their votes counted.

Debate heats up over using an anti-malaria drug to treat coronavirus
.W
President Donald Trump and members of his administration are growing emphatic in promoting an anti-malaria drug not yet officially approved for fighting COVID-19, even though scientists say more testing is needed before it's proven safe and effective against the virus.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration are growing emphatic in promoting an anti-malaria drug not yet officially approved for fighting COVID-19, even though scientists say more testing is needed before it's proven safe and effective against the virus.Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro promoted the drug, hydroxychloroquine, in television interviews Monday, a day after the president publicly put his faith in the drug to lesson the toll of the coronavirus pandemic."What do I know? I'm not a doctor," Trump told reporters Sunday. "But I have common sense."The administration's promotion of the drug comes after a heated Situation Room meeting of the White House's coronavirus task force on Saturday, in which Navarro challenged the top U.S. infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, over his concerns about recommending the drug based only on unscientific anecdotal evidence. Navarro, who has no formal medical training, erupted at Fauci, raising his voice and claiming that the reports of studies he collected were enough to recommend the drug widely, according to a person familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the Situation Room blow-up. Fauci has repeatedly said that current studies provide only anecdotal findings that the drug works.Navarro told CNN on Monday: "I would have two words for you: 'second opinion.'"Hydroxychloroquine is officially approved for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but not COVID-19.Small, preliminary studies have suggested it might help prevent the new coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner. Two reports gave mixed results. A series of 11 patients in France found that an antibiotic-malaria drug combo did not improve how fast patients cleared the virus or their symptoms.Researchers in China reported that cough, pneumonia and fever seemed to improve sooner among 31 patients given hydroxychloroquine compared with 31 others who did not get the drug, but fewer people in the comparison group had cough or fevers to start with.Doctors are already prescribing the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. But Fauci has said more testing is needed before it's clear that the drug works against the coronavirus and is safe for COVID-19 patients. Navarro told Fox News Channel's "Fox & Friends" that doctors in New York hospitals are already giving out the drug to COVID-19 patients and that health care workers are taking it in hopes it will protect them from being infected. He said the weekend standoff with Fauci was about whether the administration should take 29 million doses of the drug in Federal Emergency Management Agency warehouses and send them to hard-hit cities. "The media is trying to blow it up as a big big debate, but I can tell you that within the room the decision was a sound one, and it was unanimous," Navarro said. Asked about his credentials for pushing the drug, Navarro cited his doctorate in social science."In the fog of war, we might take more risks than we otherwise would. And, given the track record of the drug over many, many years in treating malaria that there are side effects but it's been used a lot in lesser doses, the decisions's been made by many doctors to prescribe it," Navarro said. "If it saves lives, that's a beautiful thing ... I think history will judge who's right on this debate. I'd bet on President Trump's intuition on this one."Trump has been enthusiastically supporting the drug, and he announced Sunday that his administration has amassed 29 million doses for distribution to areas of the country hard-hit by the coronavirus. "There's a study out there that says people that have lupus haven't been catching this virus," Trump said at a Saturday briefing on the virus. "You know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. ... There's also other studies ... that the malaria countries ... have very little of this virus."Trump said he would likely take the drug. "I may take it. OK? I may take it. And I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it." Administration officials said Trump's embrace of the drug stems from  his desire to provide "hope" for the American people as the death toll mounts and he looks to avoid political consequences from the outbreak.Some limited studies have been conducted on the use of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin in concert to treat COVID-19, but they have not included critical control groups that scientists use to validate the conclusions.At least one other world leader has followed on Trump's claims to promote the use of the drugs. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly touted the benefits of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.He said he heard reports of 100% effectiveness when administered in the correct dosages, zeroed tariffs for import of the drugs and on March 30 announced army labs were ramping up their chloroquine production. On Sunday, he shared a video on social media of Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, interviewing a doctor who claimed he has successfully treated hundreds of coronavirus patients with the drugs. Brazil's health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who has led the nation's virus response and endorsed broad isolation measures, said on Friday that initial tests of chloroquine's efficacy remain "fragile."Still, he announced the government would broaden criteria for the drug's use in "grave" cases. Previously, it had only authorized its use in "critical" cases. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.              WASHINGTON

British prime minister now stable in ICU with coronavirus
.W
Boris Johnson is the first major world leader to be confirmed to have COVID-19.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in stable condition Tuesday in a hospital intensive care unit with the coronavirus, and while he is not on a ventilator, he is receiving oxygen, his spokesman said.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has taken over many of Johnson’s duties temporarily while he is being treated at St. Thomas’ Hospital. Britain has no official post of deputy prime minister.The 55-year-old Johnson is the first major world leader to be confirmed to have COVID-19. He was admitted to the hospital late Sunday with a fever and cough that persisted 10 days after he was diagnosed with the virus. He was moved to the ICU Monday evening after his condition worsened.“The prime minister has been stable overnight and remains in good spirits. He is receiving standard oxygen treatment and is breathing without any other assistance," said Johnson's spokesman, James Slack.He said Johnson was not receiving mechanical ventilation or “noninvasive respiratory support.” He would not give details of what form of oxygen treatment the prime minister was getting.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said Johnson was “receiving the very, very best care from the team at St. Thomas’ and our hopes and prayers are with him and with his family.”“It was a shock yesterday to hear the news of his going into intensive care," said Gove, who is in isolation at home after a family member showed mild coronavirus symptoms. "All of us just want him to pull through — he is the leader of our country. He is a big-hearted, generous-spirited guy who believes in public service. We are rooting for him.”Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, is herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms.Raab said “the government’s business will continue” despite the prime minister's hospitalization.He said Johnson had asked him “to deputize for him where needed in driving forward the government’s plans to defeat coronavirus.”The deterioration of Johnson’s health took many in Britain by surprise. On Monday afternoon, he tweeted that he was in good spirits and thanked the National Health Service for taking care of him and others with the disease.The government faced calls Tuesday to be more transparent about Johnson's condition amid concerns it had underplayed how serious it was.It's not common for details about the health of British prime ministers to be made public, except at times of crisis. Even then, information has sometimes been scant. When Winston Churchill suffered a debilitating stroke in 1953, the government kept it secret until Churchill recovered.Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II was being kept informed about Johnson’s condition.Johnson had been quarantined in his Downing Street residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26.He continued to work throughout his illness, to the concern of some of his colleagues. With the U.K. still approaching the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and the government facing criticism it did not act soon enough to put the country into lockdown, Johnson and his ministers are under intense pressure.Johnson chaired daily meetings on the outbreak until Sunday. He released several video messages during his 10 days in isolation urging Britons to stay home and observe social distancing measures to help slow the spread of the virus.Concerns had been growing about Johnson’s welfare ever since he posted a message Friday in which he appeared red-eyed and flushed, saying he was feeling better though was still feverish.Johnson's former communications director, Will Walden, said the prime minister tended to try to soldier on through illness rather than taking a break.“He’s pretty stoic and can be a bit bloody-minded about that kind of thing,” Walden told the BBC.News that Johnson had been transferred to intensive care drew an outpouring of support from around the world.President Donald Trump said, “Americans are all praying for his recovery.”“He’s been a really good friend,” Trump said at a White House briefing. “He’s been really something very special — strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help. He did not identify the companies, but said “we have contacted all of Boris’ doctors, and we’ll see what’s going to take place, but they are ready to go.”French President Emmanuel Macron said in a tweet that he was sending his support to Johnson, his family and “the British people at this difficult time. I wish him well.”Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a telegram wishing Johnson a full and quick recovery, the Kremlin said. “I’m positive that your energy, optimism and sense of humor will help combat the disease,” Putin wrote.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, but for some, especially older adults and the infirmed, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death.The government said Monday that 51,608 people had been confirmed to have the coronavirus in Britain, and 5,373 have died.Britain’s unwritten constitution does not have a clear rule for what happens if a prime minister becomes incapacitated or dies. Seven prime ministers have died in office, but the most recent was in 1865.Johnson delegating Raab to fill in for him clarifies things for now, but it does not mean Raab would automatically take over permanently should a new leader be needed. If it became clear Johnson could not return to his job, the Conservative Party could elect a new leader, who would become prime minister.

With the U.K. still approaching the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and the government facing criticism it did not act soon enough to put the country into lockdown, Johnson and his ministers are under intense pressure. Johnson chaired daily meetings on the outbreak until Sunday. He released several video messages during his 10 days in isolation urging Britons to stay home and observe social distancing measures to help slow the spread of the virus. Concerns had been growing about Johnson’s welfare ever since he posted a message Friday in which he appeared red-eyed and flushed, saying he was feeling better though was still feverish. Johnson's former communications director, Will Walden, said the prime minister tended to try to soldier on through illness rather than taking a break. “He’s pretty stoic and can be a bit bloody-minded about that kind of thing,” Walden told the BBC. News that Johnson had been transferred to intensive care drew an outpouring of support from around the world. President Donald Trump said, “Americans are all praying for his recovery.” “He’s been a really good friend,” Trump said at a White House briefing. “He’s been really something very special — strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.” Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help. He did not identify the companies, but said “we have contacted all of Boris’ doctors, and we’ll see what’s going to take place, but they are ready to go.” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a tweet that he was sending his support to Johnson, his family and “the British people at this difficult time. I wish him well.” Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a telegram wishing Johnson a full and quick recovery, the Kremlin said. “I’m positive that your energy, optimism and sense of humor will help combat the disease,” Putin wrote. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, but for some, especially older adults and the infirmed, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death. The government said Monday that 51,608 people had been confirmed to have the coronavirus in Britain, and 5,373 have died. Britain’s unwritten constitution does not have a clear rule for what happens if a prime minister becomes incapacitated or dies. Seven prime ministers have died in office, but the most recent was in 1865. Johnson delegating Raab to fill in for him clarifies things for now, but it does not mean Raab would automatically take over permanently should a new leader be needed. If it became clear Johnson could not return to his job, the Conservative Party could elect a new leader, who would become prime minister.

"There is no impact to Comfort's mission, and this will not affect the ability for Comfort to receive patients," a Navy spokesperson said.

A crewmember of the U.S. Navy hospital ship dispatched to New York harbor to help with the coronavirus pandemic has tested positive for the virus and has been isolated from patients and other crew members, a Navy spokesperson said Tuesday."There is no impact to Comfort's mission, and this will not affect the ability for Comfort to receive patients. The ship is following protocols and taking every precaution to ensure the health and safety of all crewmembers and patients on board," Navy spokesperson Lt. Marycate Walsh told CNN.Walsh said the crewmember had no contact with patients. As of Tuesday morning, the ship has treated over 50 patients, according to a defense official.A U.S. defense official tells CNN, "those who had contact with the crew member who tested positive have been tested and will remain in isolation for several days regardless of the test result, out of an abundance of caution."The USNS Comfort's initial mission was to treat only non-coronavirus patients, but the U.S. military announced Monday night that the Comfort will take patients without regard to whether they have tested positive for COVID-19 or not.A Navy official tells CNN that because of the directive to treat coronavirus patients, the Comfort will now have half the capacity it would normally have."In order to ensure the safety of all of our patients as well as our crew, we have had to reconfigure the military treatment facility. This reconfiguration will allow us to separate our COVID and our non-COVID patients, but it brings our capacity down to approximately 500 patients," the official said.

The mystery of why the coronavirus kills some young people

No matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same: Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible.

When 30-year-old Ben Luderer started to feel sick, he wasn't that surprised. Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus, but there wasn't much to it.All she had was a really low-grade temperature, one that the doctors didn't even really consider to be a fever, she said. She had some congestion, but she was on the mend. He wasn't all that worried, either, when he started feeling unwell. After all, they were both young and healthy.The two worked in the Cliffside Park School District in New Jersey, both as special education teachers — she at School #4, he at School #6.  A star baseball player in high school, he continued his passion by coaching the varsity baseball team.For Ben, however, his symptoms quickly became more severe. He had more shortness of breath, and by the last Friday in March, he told Brandy it was time to go to the emergency room."He was really concerned," Brandy said. "He came into our bedroom where I was laying, and he said, you know, 'I've got to go. I've got to take myself to the hospital.'""Are you sure you want to go there?" she asked him.He said "Yes, I need to."Immediately, Brandy drove him to the hospital. She couldn't go in with him, though, because they weren't accepting visitors. So she sat in the car the entire evening and they texted back and forth."He updated me the whole time," she said.At the hospital, Ben received oxygen and responded well, Brandy said. They gave him fluids and Tylenol and then sent him home that same evening."Keep doing what you're doing at home," they said. Related video: College student who tested positive for COVID-19 warning others about coronavirusThe following Sunday, he was feeling better and showing signs of improvement, his wife said. He got out of bed and ate dinner for the first time."Sunday was a great day. He was up moving around, talking to us," Brandy said. Ben was on the road to recovery, it seemed. That night, however, his symptoms returned."Ben always said the nights had been the worst for him. He would sweat and when he laid down a certain way," Brandy said. "It was particularly hard for him to breathe."That night, Ben had an especially hard time getting comfortable. Because Ben was sleeping in the bedroom, and Brandy on the couch, they were texting back and forth to communicate. At one point, Ben texted his wife and said, "I'm struggling." Brandy asked him if he needed to go back to the ER, and Ben replied that he wasn't sure."So, I just tried to do as much as I could to make him comfortable, you know, calm down his breathing, you know, get him to cool down," Brandy said. She borrowed a humidifier from a friend to try that.Once Ben finally settled into bed, Brandy listened through the door of their bedroom."I could hear through the door that he was still breathing, and I fell asleep," she said. She checked in on him again at 2 a.m, and all seemed OK. However, when she woke at 6 a.m., she found her 30-year-old husband lifeless in their bed."Whether he knew you for five minutes or he knew you for his whole entire life, he would give you the same respect and try to reach out and help you and make you laugh in any way possible. That was just the type of selfless person he was," remembered Brandy.Related video: Family mourns loss of 31-year-old Boston man killed by coronavirusThey were husband and wife, but also best friends, both working in the same school district, driving to work every day. She didn't know what she would do with herself on Monday, let alone the rest of her life.And Brandy was left with a mystery. She knew her husband was sick, but how was it possible that a young, healthy 30-year-old with no pre-existing conditions declined so swiftly?Ben Luderer's story is one of many that have perplexed health officials around the globe. Why is it that some young people are getting sick and dying so abruptly?It is true that COVID-19 seems to most seriously affect older people, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes.It could be that an elderly person's immune systems may not be able to fight off the disease as well, and the virus can more easily replicate, overwhelming the body and causing multiple organ system failure. And yet, as we start to look deeper and hear more stories, it is becoming apparent there are many people like Ben, who are younger and still get very sick and die.Conrad Buchanan, a 39-year-old who was a healthy, vivacious Florida DJ, who also died after having coronavirus despite having no underlying conditions, according to his wife.We have known for some time that this new disease, COVID-19, was not only an older person's disease. It has become clear that the young and healthy are by no means immune to this infection and could become sick enough to require hospitalization.In an early snapshot from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for 2,449 patients whose age was known, 18% were between age 45 and 54, and 29% were between 20 and 44 years old. Among those who were hospitalized, 18% were ages 45 to 54 and 20% were ages 20 to 44.Younger people are far less likely to die, but there is an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging.  Dr. Anthony Fauci said it is what makes the coronavirus such an "unusual disease.""I'm fascinated," he said, " ... by what I would call the pathogenesis.""You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a cardio-pulmonary machine) and they're dead," Fauci said."I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out."So, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die.One possibility is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene.ACE2 is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart. In an article in Science magazine, Immunologist Dr. Philip Murphy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that "variations in the ACE2 gene that alter the receptor could make it easier or harder for the virus to get into lung cells."It is also possible that a critical ingredient produced by the body, known as surfactant, which better allows the lungs to expand and contract, becomes depleted in some patients infected with the coronavirus.If you think of your lungs as a sponge, surfactant would be the detergent which would make them soft and pliable. Without surfactant, however, your lung becomes stiff and hard to squeeze. It may be why some patients continue to struggle even on a breathing machine.Another avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place.In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs.In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem — it is one that works too well. Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.Perhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.To better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age.While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people, like Ben and Conrad, we need to better understand.For now, no matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same. Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible. Even if you do develop mild symptoms, it is probably best to stay home to recover.But if you develop trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, sudden confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, please, it is time to go to the hospital.Ben Luderer's wife said doctors still can't explain exactly what happened."We don't really know," Brandy said. "I don't really know."For now, all she can do is take things minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day to process how quickly her life changed."Ben and I were the type of couple that did everything together," she said. "So it's very hard understanding where to go with this when you don't have your partner in life that you did everything with. So, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it."

Will taking the right health supplements boost your immune system and help prevent you from getting the novel coronavirus?

Will taking the right health supplements boost your immune system and help prevent you from getting the novel coronavirus? It's a question Americans are asking daily as confirmed cases climb with each passing day.To get a better understanding, Mark Albert spoke with Dr. Aisha Terry of George Washington University, to see what supplements, if any, can help prevent or treat COVID-19."Will taking supplements to build the immune system help ward off the coronavirus?" Albert asked. "In particular, echinacea, vitamin C? What is the science on that? What do you know on that?""Well, we're lucky in that there have been significant studies in the past on using various over-the-counter agents and vitamins and the like in terms of boosting our immune system," Terry said. "Not necessarily specific to COVID-19, but in terms of other types of viral illnesses." Terry also said there has been data suggesting the use of vitamin C could boost the immune system, and more data pointing to vitamin D possibly boosting lung capacity and lung health as well."And so I think that, you know, the over-the counter vitamins to boost our immune systems, as long as they're taken in accordance with what the directions say as far as the amount and the frequency, there's likely no harm in taking those items to try to boost our immune systems," Terry said. While supplements can be beneficial, Terry was quick to point out diet and exercise are also key components of health."Additionally, remember, it's important to eat, right?" Terry said. "Exercise, you know, meditate, make sure that mentally we're as healthy as we can be, because those actions also play a big role in keeping us healthy and keeping our immune system strong."The FDA last month issued a warning about dietary supplements if they're falsely marketed as a cure for COVID-19.            As of now, no FDA-approved treatment exists.                        Will taking the right health supplements boost your immune system and help prevent you from getting the novel coronavirus?

U.S. officials have now confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

U.S. officials have now confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus in the country, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.These include 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 14 U.S. cases."We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday.The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China. There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated.The 14 U.S. cases include eight in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California.The 13th U.S. case was confirmed Thursday night in Humboldt County, California. County officials offered few details but said a close contact with symptoms was also undergoing testing, and both are self-isolating at home. The 14th case is a Sacramento resident who recently traveled to China, the Sacramento County Department of Public Health announced Friday.Messonnier said there are additional Americans from the Diamond Princess group who remain hospitalized in Japan and are "seriously ill."'A robust inter-agency discussion'On Thursday, The Washington Post reported there had been tensions between the CDC and the U.S. Department of State regarding the decision to allow asymptomatic Americans from the Diamond Princess group who tested positive to board a repatriation flight along with other passengers who had not.A State Department official told reporters Friday that an execution plan was already underway when Japanese lab results became available."I think the folks on the ground did just the right thing, by -- out of an abundance of caution -- moving those 14 people into an isolation area where they pose no threat to themselves or anyone else, to provide room for a robust inter-agency discussion between not just CDC and state, but really the operational elements of HHS," said Dr. William Walters, executive director and managing director for operational medicine at the State Department's Bureau of Medical Services.In total, more than 300 US citizens aboard the Diamond Princess were repatriated on two flights chartered by the State Department."At the end of the day, the State Department had a decision to make, informed by our inter-agency partners, and we went ahead and made that decision," Walters said. "And the decision, I think, was the right one in bringing those people home."Messonnier said, "These are difficult decisions that we're faced with every day, and we're making those decisions in real time."She added, "We are one U.S. government, working together," but that the focus going forward will be on the health of repatriated U.S. citizens and continuing the overall coronavirus response.That response, she said, involves not just looking for new cases of coronavirus, but preparing for what happens if the virus spreads in the United States. This includes working with partners in the medical supply chain to make sure health care systems are well-stocked, and working with hospitals across the country to "plan for surges of people seeking and requiring care," Messonnier said."This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat," she said. "We are now taking and will continue to take unprecedented, aggressive action to reduce the impact of this virus ... on the communities in the U.S."                        U.S. officials have now confirmed 35 cases of novel coronavirus in the country, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. These include 21 cases among repatriated individuals, as well as 14 U.S. cases.                              Advertisement                       "We are keeping track of cases resulting from repatriation efforts separately because we don't believe those numbers accurately represent the picture of what is happening in the community in the United States at this time," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday. The 21 repatriated include 18 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan, plus three who had been previously evacuated from China. There are 10 additional passengers among the Diamond Princess evacuees who tested positive for the virus in Japan, and who Messonnier said will likely be added to the official US count once the Japanese test results have been adjudicated. The 14 U.S. cases include eight in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin.

Walgreens expanding drive-thru coronavirus testing locations

Walgreens says it is working to expand drive-thru testing of coronavirus to 15 new sites in seven states.

Walgreens says it is working to expand drive-thru testing of coronavirus to 15 new sites in seven states. The pharmacy chain said those new sites will be located in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. In March, Walgreens and some of the nation's largest retailers including Walmart, CVS and Target announced they would open their parking lots in select locations across the country to help in the testing phase. Executives from those companies were in the White House Rose Garden when President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to the spread of the virus. Walgreens says its new testing sites will utilize the new ID NOW COVID-19 test, which can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes, and negative results within 13 minutes, according to the test's creator, Abbott Laboratories. The new locations are being finalized in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services. Walgreens says it plans to be able to test up to 3,000 people per day across these additional sites. Those are expected to begin later this week.“Walgreens remains committed to working with federal, state and local governments, as well as industry partners to meet the needs of the communities we serve across the country during the pandemic,” said Walgreens president Richard Ashworth. “We’re continuing to do everything we can, both with our own resources and also by partnering with others, to serve as an access point within the community for COVID-19 testing."

Lions, tigers and house cats: You won't catch coronavirus from felines, experts say
.W
While it's highly unlikely that you can give COVID-19 to your cat if you are sick with the virus, experts say we should be following common sense guidelines.

Lions, tigers and house cats, oh my.Seven tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York developed dry coughs and other symptoms of coronavirus after being exposed to a zookeeper "asymptomatically infected with the virus," according to a press release from the zoo on Sunday.This follows a report that a Belgian woman with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, infected her pet cat in early March. But even though the cat had respiratory problems and high levels of the virus in its vomit and feces, researchers aren't yet sure if the cat was sick from COVID-19 or another illness.So what do these cases mean for felines and their human caretakers? It appears that while humans can pass the coronavirus on to cats, experts agree that getting coronavirus from a cat is extremely unlikely."The bottom line is that there is no evidence that any cat, large or small, can transmit the virus back to humans," said veterinarian Dr. Sarah Caddy, a clinical research fellow at the University of Cambridge.But until we know more about coronavirus, experts are also suggesting anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 avoid contact with their cats, to avoid the extremely rare chance that you might infect your pet."If a member of the household becomes sick with COVID-19, they should be isolated from all members of the household, pets included," said professor Jacqui Norris, from the Sydney School of Veterinary Science at The University of Sydney.Not surprisingNadia, a 4-year-old female Malayan tiger, was anesthetized and tested for COVID-19 "out of an abundance of caution" and was found to be positive, the Bronx Zoo announced Sunday. Her sister Azul; two Amur tigers; and three African lions also lost appetite and developed a dry cough, but "are bright, alert and interactive with their keepers," the zoo said.However, other tigers, lions, snow leopards, cheetahs, clouded leopards, Amur leopards, pumas or servals the infected zookeeper cared for are showing no signs of the disease.Experts say it's not surprising that exotic cats can develop COVID-19, also called SARS-CoV-2.Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, has studied coronviruses for decades. He said that tigers also caught SARS-CoV, the related coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), during the outbreak from 2002 to 2004.However, it is surprising that the Bronx tiger became infected with "what must have been a fairly low dose of virus — we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zoo keeper," said Caddy."It is possible that tigers in captivity are more susceptible to the virus than household moggies as there is a 5% difference between their genomes," she said. (Moggie is an affectionate British slang word for non-pedigree cats.)An unpublished study in China, released without peer review last week, also found domestic house cats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 if large doses of virus are administered via their nostrils in an experimental setting."These researchers squirted the virus down the cats noses in high concentration, which is pretty artificial," Williams said.The fact that house cats can rarely catch COVID-19 is also not surprising, experts say.Domestic cats were found to be susceptible to SARS during that outbreak, said Gilles Guillemin, a professor of neuroscience at Macquarie University, who has also studied coronaviruses."But there was no indication during the SARS pandemic that SARS-CoV became widespread in house cats or was transmitted from cats to humans," Guillemin said.Nor is it any reason to worry that your cat (or your neighbor's) might be able to infect you or other cats with coronavirus, experts say."There is no evidence that naturally infected cats can shed the virus in sufficient quantity either to infect other cats or people," said Ken Smith, a professor of companion animal pathology at the Royal Veterinary College in London."These occasional instances of human to animal transmission of COVID-19 do not in any way detract from the fact that all current evidence shows that the pandemic is driven by human to human transmission," Smith said.What to doWhile it's highly unlikely that you can give COVID-19 to your cat if you are sick with the virus, experts say we should be following common sense guidelines."Contact between infected people and other animals should be minimized," Smith said. "Specifically, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food."And if you know you're not sick, you can continue to cuddle up close. "I'm still embracing my cat and dogs," Williams said.                         Lions, tigers and house cats, oh my.

Sen. Rand Paul recovers from coronavirus; volunteering at hospital
.W
"Together we will overcome this," Senator Paul said.

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said Tuesday that he has recovered from the coronavirus  and has started volunteering at a hospital in his Kentucky hometown.The Republican lawmaker tested positive for the virus in March, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate.“I appreciate all the best wishes I have received," Paul said Tuesday. “I have been retested and I am negative. I have started volunteering at a local hospital to assist those in my community who are in need of medical help, including coronavirus patients. Together we will overcome this.”Paul, an eye surgeon, is volunteering at TriStar Greenview Regional Hospital in Bowling Green while the Senate is on a break amid the coronavirus outbreak. Paul worked in emergency rooms early in his career as a physician, his office said.Related Video: President Trump: U.S. praying for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson amid hospitalizationThe hospital's CEO, Mike Sherrod, said Tuesday that the senator is “lifting the spirits of patients and our colleagues” by volunteering.“We appreciate Senator Paul and his support in recognizing our healthcare workers and providers at TriStar Greenview for their unwavering response to the COVID-19 pandemic," he said in a statement.Paul went into quarantine after learning his initial test results in March. He later said he had been tested the prior week but continued working at the Capitol because he had no symptoms of the illness and believed it was “highly unlikely" he was sick. Paul also said he did not have direct contact with anyone who tested positive for the virus or was sick. Paul’s refusal to self-quarantine after being tested drew harsh criticism from some of his colleagues.Paul said last month that he took the initial test because of his extensive travel prior to the start of social-distancing practices and because he’s at a higher risk for serious complications from the virus. The senator had part of a lung removed last year in a procedure he says stemmed from injuries he suffered when a neighbor tackled him outside his Kentucky home in 2017.             FRANKFORT, Ky.

'If I did it, you can do it': A 90-year-old who survived coronavirus offers hope
.W
The widowed mother of five developed asthma late in life but was otherwise healthy and strong.

Anna Fortunato, a 90-year-old survivor of COVID-19, has a message for the rest of us:Do not be afraid. Do not despair."Keep on fighting, have that positive attitude, and pray," she says. "And get out of bed. Don't stay in bed all the time. ... And I want to say to them, 'If I did it, you can do it.'"That she is here to advise others is something of a surprise to Fortunato herself."In the hospital, they said I was a miracle," said the Long Island woman, a daughter of Italian immigrants born the year the stock market crashed.

World Health Day: Meet the heroes on the frontlines of the coronavirus
.W
Here are just a few of the stories of nurses and public health workers fighting back every day against the coronavirus.

World Health Day is observed on April 7. This year, the day is dedicated to honoring nurses and midwives, but it's possible they won't notice. The nurses are just too busy.For hospital nurses, life under the coronavirus is a slog of precautions, fear and duty.Northside Hospital sits in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. It is not among the hardest-hit facilities in the country. There are no refrigerated trucks ominously idling in its parking lot like you'd see in New York. There is no dire lack of protective equipment for hospital workers there — at least not yet.But there is an army of dedicated nurses caught up in the fight against coronavirus. A few of them had a moment to describe their life calling, their mission now and the personal tolls the pandemic is taking.Here are the stories of two Northside nurses and one public health nurse in a rural county.'Not everyone can do this job'"After fifteen years working in the emergency room of a hospital, I've never seen anything like this before," Sara Wazlavek said.She says the nature of her job can shift by the hour."Rules, policies and procedures are rapidly changing based on the new data that comes out daily," she tells CNN.One thing doesn't change: her fear of bringing the virus home. Nursing is Wazlavek's calling, but her identity is mother and wife."No one wants to put their family's lives on the line. I come home with the knowledge that I might be bringing COVID into my home, that it could kill me, my husband or my kids. I didn't think becoming a nurse would mean possibly losing my family, or that I would be the cause."But Wazlavek reports for her shifts  because there's a pandemic to fight, and she's a nurse."Not everyone can do this job. It takes training. If everyone who was afraid quit, who would be left. What makes me so special that I can stay home when others are putting their lives at risk? I want to help my coworkers. I can't abandon them. I want to help the people in our community who need us. I can't abandon them either."Wazlavek says that for now, her hospital has enough gloves, masks and gowns to keep her relatively safe."For how long though?" she wonders out loud. "What happens if they don't? Do I go to work, put my life, my family's lives, at risk even more than I already am? Or do I leave the hospital and patients to fend for themselves?"Wazlavek does not consider herself a hero. But for people who want to honor her sacrifice and grit, she has one suggestion: stay home.Related: Coronavirus Unsung Heroes— Chaunci SingletonBringing babies into the world during a global health crisisChandler Scott is a maternity nurse at Northside, which claims to deliver more babies each year than any other community hospital in the country.She says the pandemic has made the birthing process a lot colder for everyone involved, especially suspected coronavirus carriers."Babies get separated immediately from parents and placed in quarantine until deemed safe to return to the mother," she said.Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses attend the deliveries. They wear N95 respirator masks with plastic eye shields, isolation gowns and gloves as they whisk the baby away."We now have strict visitation. Parents are no longer allowed in the NICU to visit their newborn child," she said.Scott says parents get a 30-minute orientation visit when their infant is first admitted and cannot return until the days leading up to discharge.In the meantime, nurses in surgical masks tend to the babies and set up FaceTime and Skype meetings so new parents and newborns can gaze at each other. Social distancing starts young in these strange times.Ready to answer the callAbout an hour's drive away from Northside Hospital, Jessica Baker is preparing to administer COVID-19 tests in Georgia's Lumpkin county.The Georgia public health nurse is literally taking the community's temperature when it comes to the pandemic, and informing the uninsured and people with low incomes about available services."No matter where I end up for the day, I always hit the ground running and don't stop until it's time to go home," she says. "These are uncharted waters and I want to make sure that I am able to provide the community with the most up-to-date information as we receive it."In addition to the uncertainty involving the virus and human nature, she also finds herself at the mercy of the weather. She must wait until rain passes before donning her protective gear. Temperatures are rising in the Georgia spring, and masks, gloves and gowns gets uncomfortable fast.Baker is comfortable with her job. The pandemic is a big deal, but like so many nurses rising to the occasion, a disaster like this one has lurked at the back of her mind for a long time."Despite all of the advances in medicine and technology, I always knew there was a chance that I would be called to the front line if there was a crisis and I have been ready to answer that call," she said.

Delta donating thousands of pounds of unused foods to health care workers, food banks

Company officials said perishable and non-perishable goods are being donated after adjustments were made to services on board aimed at reducing contact between customers and employees.

Delta Air Lines has announced the company is donating of thousands of pounds of unusable food as the coronavirus pandemic affects travel and flight services. According to Delta's News Hub, the company is providing food donations to hospitals, food banks and other agencies across the globe to help those in need, as well as those on the front lines of the COVID-19 outbreak. Company officials said perishable and non-perishable goods are being donated after adjustments were made to services on board aimed at reducing contact between customers and employees. "Delta has longstanding relationships with organizations like Feeding America, a nonprofit network that helps us support numerous food banks and where employees help repack more than 2 million pounds of food annually," the company news release says. "During the pandemic, local Feeding America organizations are distributing the donations to those in need."   To date, Delta has already donated more than 200,000 pounds of perishable foods to Feeding America, along with caterers that have provided pre-packaged snacks to hospitals and health care workers. The company has also coordinated food donations to local food banks, first responders, charities and churches. Delta employees have also made efforts to help their own by sending fresh "Flight Fuel" boxed meals to its reservations and customer care centers to support workers responding to an increasing number of customers making changes to travel plans.In addition to food donations, Delta officials say they've been providing free flights to medical professionals and using its aircraft interiors subsidiary, Delta Flight Products, to produce face shields to protect health care workers.

Grocery stores turn to robots during the coronavirus
.W
Grocers are searching for ways to reduce pressure on store workers and increase efficiency amid a surge of shoppers visiting stores and ordering online during the pandemic.

Local grocers and big chains alike are deploying robots to clean floors, stock shelves and deliver groceries to shoppers during the coronavirus.Grocers are searching for ways to reduce pressure on store workers and increase efficiency amid a surge of shoppers visiting stores and ordering online during the crisis. They believe robots and AI offer solutions that can help them bring down costs and improve store operations."There's strong interest in moving rapidly in this direction because everyone knows they need to raise their game to stay competitive and it's ultimately more cost effective to automate than staff up, especially in today's labor market," said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.Experts say the crisis may speed up grocers' use of robots in stores."I strongly believe that the current health crisis will accelerate the adoption of robots in retail," said Steven Keith Platt, research director for the Retail Analytics Council and adjunct professor at Northwestern University. "Short-term, this is to address health concerns" of workers and customers, he said. In the long term, robots in stores will stock shelves and prepare food.How grocers are using robotsIn Washington, D.C., Broad Branch Market has brought on 44-pound, six-wheel self-driving robots equipped with sensors and AI to ferry deliveries to customers in the area. Broad Branch has closed its stores to shoppers and shifted its operations to delivery and pick-up orders only during the crisis."We have had them for a little over a week and they are very popular ," said store co-owner Tracy Stannard.Brain Corp., which supplies autonomous floor-scrubbing robots to grocers, said it saw a 13% jump in the usage of its robots at stores in March compared to a year ago. Grocers staying open during the crisis have shortened their hours to allow for deep cleaning overnight.Walmart, the country's largest retailer and private employer, will have Brain Corp's self-driving robots in 1,860 of its more than 4,700 U.S. stores by the end of the year. It will also have robots that scan shelf inventory at 1,000 stores and bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts by the end of the year.During the crisis, Walmart has continued to roll out robots in stores, a spokesperson said.The company said the "smart assistants" reduce the amount of time workers spend on "repeatable, predictable and manual" tasks in stores, allowing workers to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles.At a handful of Schnucks Markets stores in the Midwest, Tally, an autonomous robot, scans shelves to alert employees when products are out of stock or labeled incorrectly, said Brad Bogolea, CEO of Simbe Robotics, which developed the robot."This massive surge in demand was a major shock to most retailers' inventory counts," said Bogolea. The robot has been restocking items on shelves to help keep up with demand, he said.Clearing the aisles of workersGrocers are also looking to take the process for picking customers' online grocery orders out of store aisles. Workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is costly for grocers, and employees picking orders can clog up aisles.Albertsons, Stop & Shop and other grocers are testing small automated "micro-fulfillment centers" in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers' orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.Good for business, bad news for workersTakeoff Technologies, one of the companies that has created these mini-warehouses, has seen a double-digit increase in orders since the crisis began."Robots handle a majority of the leg-work when fulfilling orders, meaning there is limited contact with grocery items," said Jose Aguerrevere, CEO of Takeoff Technologies. The process is "well suited" for social distancing.Some fear that this type automation, however, will lead to the disappearance of low-wage jobs.There are more than 15 million retail workers in America today, and lower-skilled jobs in the industry such as cashiers and clerks are among those vulnerable to technology advances. In the retail industry, "margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," according to McKinsey. "Automation will disproportionately disrupt retail."The Brookings Institution said in a report last month that "any coronavirus-related recession is likely to bring about a spike in labor-replacing automation.""Automation happens in bursts, concentrated especially in bad times such as in the wake of economic shocks, when humans become relatively more expensive as firms' revenues rapidly decline," the Brookings Institution said in its report.

Verizon is cutting back on in-home technician visits for internet service installations and repairs to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Verizon is cutting back on in-home technician visits for internet service installations and repairs to slow the spread of coronavirus."To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our employees and customers safe, we are making every attempt to perform work without going into homes or small businesses," Howie Waterman, Verizon director of corporate communications in technology and innovation, told CNN Business in an email.As coronavirus spreads across the United States — there are now more than 383,000 reported cases in the country — many health and government officials have urged people to stay home and "nonessential" businesses to close. Verizon serves 6.2 million internet customers, according to its website, many of whom find themselves working or attending school from home.The company is limiting installations to "medical emergencies and critical installations," Waterman said. Verizon did not immediately respond to a question about what qualifies as a critical installation.On the Verizon website, where customers sign up for new internet service, there is a notice informing customers that "at this time, our technicians will not be able to enter your home or business to install new services." The notice says customers can still place orders, which "will be held for future installation on a priority basis."However, Verizon is working on plans to ensure customers maintain access to the internet.The company is piloting a virtual assistant tool that allows technicians to aid customers via video chat to troubleshoot issues without workers having to enter homes.

Jack Dorsey sets aside $1 billion for charity. His initial focus: coronavirus relief efforts
.W
It's around 28% of his wealth.

Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey says he's dedicating more than a quarter of his wealth to a new fund for charitable causes, with the immediate focus on coronavirus relief efforts.Dorsey will transfer $1 billion of his equity in Square — the digital payments company he also co-founded — to a limited liability company called Start Small, he said in a series of tweets on Tuesday. Dorsey said that amount accounts for around 28% of his wealth.The first of those grants from Start Small, for $100,000, will go to America's Food Fund to provide meals to those impacted by the coronavirus, according to a Google Doc he shared for tracking all the grants.Dorsey did not specify how much of the $1 billion commitment will be directed toward coronavirus relief as opposed to other charitable efforts after the pandemic ends."After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl's health and education, and UBI," he said, referring to the concept of universal basic income. "I believe they represent the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world."Dorsey's announcement follows similar efforts by other big tech players. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates — the world's two wealthiest people — have each pledged $100 million toward coronavirus relief.Some of the industry's biggest companies are also putting their immense resources behind the fight against the global pandemic.Google last month committed $800 million — much of it in ad grants to small businesses and healthcare organizations. Facebook has adopted a similar ad credit strategy, while working with global authorities to fight misinformation on its platforms.

The league is considering "numerous contingency plans" for once the public health situation improves, according to the statement.

One of the many facets of life put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic are, to the anguish of many fans, sports.Now, Major League Baseball is examining how to start its 2020 season, after canceling spring training and indefinitely delaying Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 26.Most notably, the league is considering playing the entire season in one location."While we have discussed the idea of staging games at one location as one potential option, we have not settled on that option or developed a detailed plan," MLB said in a statement Tuesday.The league is considering "numerous contingency plans" for once the public health situation improves, according to the statement.MLB is considering playing games as early as May, ESPN reported.Other reports say the league is considering having all teams play in Arizona, where half of MLB teams hold their spring training in the Phoenix area. The stadiums are all within about 50 miles from each other, allowing teams to quarantine in a hotel and not have to travel very far for their games.The games, of course, would be played without fans.ESPN also reported that the league is discussing using an electronic strike zone so the plate umpire would not have to be right on the catcher and hitter.Still, the league says it has yet to seek approval for any specific plan from government officials or the MLB Players Association so far."The health and safety of our employees, players, fans and the public at large are paramount, and we are not ready at this time to endorse any particular format for staging games in light of the rapidly changing public health situation caused by the coronavirus," according to MLB's statement.The MLB Players Association had no comment to this story.

100 American Airlines flight attendants have coronavirus, union says
.W
The union representing flight attendants for American Airlines says about 100 flight attendants have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The union representing flight attendants for American Airlines says about 100 flight attendants have tested positive for the coronavirus.The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, representing more than 27,000 flight attendants, disclosed the figure in a message to its membership and said the airline has "agreed to start providing face masks for frontline team members while at work should you choose to wear one." The union said masks are being distributed this week.APFA president Julie Hedrick said Tuesday the union has "been pushing the company since January" to provide personal protective equipment for flight attendants."We have consistently advocated for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for all of our flight attendants to be available on every aircraft, for social distancing between passengers and crew jump seats, for thermal scanning in the airports, and to receive immediate notification of flight attendants who have tested positive for the virus," Hedrick said. "Flight attendants are aviation's first responders, who are transporting medical personnel and supplies into COVID-19 hotspots, and they need to be treated and protected as such."American would not comment directly on the union's claim of flight attendants testing positive for the virus at the world's largest airline."The safety of our customers and team members is our top priority," the airline's statement said. "We are in close contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health officials and are coordinating with them on any required health and safety related measures. We continue to look at all ways we can care -- and protect -- our team during this stressful time."In another message to its membership, the union indicated it expects only about one in four of its flight attendants to be flying in May, due to major cuts in the airline's schedule.The airline is prevented from involuntarily furlough any employees during the next six months as part of the terms of the coronavirus relief act that is expected to give $25 billion in grants to the nation's passenger airlines.American CEO Doug Parker warned employees a week ago that many of them "will be at minimal paid hours for months to come."

At 90, she said her final goodbyes as doctors prepared her to die from coronavirus. Then she survived

"I said to the doctor, this is the end. I'm not gonna make it and I want to see my family. And that was my only wish and desire was to be able to talk to my children again."

Geneva Wood knew her life was about to end. She could feel it with every strained breath.She was well aware her 90-year-old lungs were filling with fluid. She was drowning from the inside out. The coronavirus had taken hold and she had one last request."I said to the doctor, this is the end. I'm not gonna make it and I want to see my family," Wood told CNN. "And that was my only wish and desire was to be able to talk to my children again."Her doctor agreed. She was dying. Her children were called to see their mom alive one last time. With so little oxygen in her lungs Wood was losing the ability to talk.Her daughter, Cami Neidigh, drove from home to the hospital."They didn't think that she was going to make it, and that we should go ahead and come on down while she can still talk to us," her daughter said.Related video: Coronavirus survivor: 'In my blood, there may be answers'The news was doubly devastating for the family. Wood had been recovering from a stroke."It was kind of cruel, you know," Neidigh said. "She had just learned to live again."Wood's family had chosen to send her for rehab to the nearby Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, after her stroke. When Wood arrived months earlier, she couldn't talk. She couldn't walk. She couldn't speak well enough to be understood.The staff cared for her until she could do all those things."All I could do was jabber and they taught me to live again," Wood said. "I went there for therapy, which they provided. What the staff did for me was great."But as she regained her strength, the coronavirus spread through the Life Care Center of Kirkland. It became the first place in America to have a major deadly outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Only nobody realized it at the time. The virus was spreading like a deadly plague inside the facility long before people switched to elbow bumps instead of handshakes, and before self-distancing and stay-at-home orders became the norm.Geneva Wood suddenly found herself infected like 80 other patients there.She was rushed to the hospital where the virus began taking her breath away."I coughed a lot." Wood said "I had trouble breathing, I was just tired. I just wanted to sleep and rest and just leave me alone."She had never felt the kind of exhaustion that came with COVID-19. The spitfire of a great-grandmother says she survived the flu dozens of times while raising her children and survived the Great Depression and World War II, but she never wanted to give up until she got the coronavirus.But her body fought it. And she survived, with her humor intact."I'm not dead yet," Wood quipped to the nurse who she asked to bring her water.Wood was one of the lucky ones. Fifty-five people associated with the Life Care nursing home died, many younger than her.Now Wood is home and able to speak with her family, who she once feared she might never see or talk to again.She snuggled up next to her daughter in her big comfortable chair and marveled at how happy she was just to be home."I love it here. One of the things I fought for was to be able to be with my kids. To give them a hug or a kick or whatever they needed," Wood said.Her daughter cracked up. Her feisty, strong-willed mother was back."That's, that's what I'm here for." Wood laughed. "To take care of their needs. If they need a hug that's what they need and if they need a kick in the rear, that's what they get."Her daughter is relieved to hear her mom joke again."It's been a brutal roller coaster ride," she says.And Neidigh wants anyone who is writing off the elderly as those who can be sacrificed to coronavirus for the sake of others or for the economy to remember people like her mother. She says nobody should get to choose who gets to live or die and that the world could used the wisdom of the elderly. They still have something to give."You can't put a price on life like that," Neidigh said.                        Geneva Wood knew her life was about to end.

Singer-songwriter John Prine dies at 73 from coronavirus complications
.W
His family announced he died from complications from the coronavirus.

John Prine, the ingenious singer-songwriter who explored the heartbreaks, indignities and absurdities of everyday life in “Angel from Montgomery,” “Sam Stone,” “Hello in There” and scores of other indelible tunes, died Tuesday at the age of 73.His family announced his death from complications from the coronavirus; he died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.His wife Fiona said last month that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and she has since recovered, but her husband was hospitalized on March 26 with coronavirus symptoms. He was put on a ventilator and remained in the intensive care unit for several days.Winner of a lifetime achievement Grammy earlier this year, Prine was a virtuoso of the soul, if not the body. He sang his conversational lyrics in a voice roughened by a hard-luck life, particularly after throat cancer left him with a disfigured jaw.He joked that he fumbled so often on the guitar, taught to him as a teenager by his older brother, that people thought he was inventing a new style. But his open-heartedness, eye for detail and sharp and surreal humor brought him the highest admiration from critics, from such peers as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and from such younger stars as Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, who even named a song after him.In 2017, Rolling Stone proclaimed him “The Mark Twain of American songwriting.”Prine began playing as a young Army veteran who invented songs to fight boredom while delivering the U.S. mail in Maywood, Illinois. He and his friend, folk singer Steve Goodman, were still polishing their skills at the Old Town School of Folk Music when Kristofferson, a rising star at the time, heard them sing one night in Chicago, and invited them to share his stage in New York City. The late film critic Roger Ebert, then with the Chicago Sun-Times, also saw one of his shows and declared him an “extraordinary new composer.”Suddenly noticed by America’s most popular folk, rock and country singers, Prine signed with Atlantic Records and released his first album in 1971.“I was really into writing about characters, givin’ ‘em names,” Prine said, reminiscing about his long career in a January 2016 public television interview that was posted on his website.“You just sit and look around you. You don’t have to make up stuff. If you just try to take down the bare description of what’s going on, and not try to over-describe something, then it leaves space for the reader or the listener to fill in their experience with it, and they become part of it.”He was among the many promoted as a “New Dylan” and among the few to survive it and find his own way. Few songwriters could equal his wordplay, his empathy or his imagination.“I try to look through someone else’s eyes,” he told Ebert in 1970. His characters were common people and confirmed eccentrics, facing the frustrations and pleasures anyone could relate to. “Sam Stone” traces the decline of a drug-addicted Vietnam veteran through the eyes of his little girl. “Donald and Lydia” tells of a tryst between a shy Army private and small-town girl, both vainly searching for “love hidden deep in your heart.” “He writes beautiful songs,” Dylan once told MTV producer Bill Flanagan. “I remember when Kris Kristofferson first brought him on the scene. All that stuff about Sam Stone the soldier-junkie-daddy, and Donald and Lydia, where people make love from ten miles away -- nobody but Prine could write like that.”Prine’s mischief shined in songs like “Illegal Smile,” which he swore wasn’t about marijuana; “Spanish Pipedream,” about a topless waitress with “something up her sleeve;” and “Dear Abby,” in which Prine imagines the advice columnist getting fed up with whiners and hypochondriacs. Prine was never a major commercial success, but performed for more than four decades, often selling his records at club appearances where he mentored rising country and bluegrass musicians.“I felt like I was going door to door meeting the people and cleaning their carpets and selling them a record,” he joked in a 1995 Associated Press interview.Many others adopted his songs. Raitt made a signature tune out of “Angel from Montgomery,” about the stifled dreams of a lonely housewife, and performed it at the 2020 Grammys ceremony. Bette Midler recorded “Hello in There,” Prine’s poignant take on old age. Prine wrote “Unwed Fathers” for Tammy Wynette, and “Love Is on a Roll” for Don Williams.Others who covered Prine’s music included Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, John Denver, the Everly Brothers, Carly Simon, George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Norah Jones and Old Crow Medicine Show.Prine himself regarded Dylan and Cash as key influences, bridges between folk and country whose duet on Dylan’s country rock album “Nashville Skyline” made Prine feel there was a place for him in contemporary music. Though mostly raised in Maywood, he spent summers in Paradise, Kentucky, and felt so great an affinity to his family’s roots there he would call himself “pure Kentuckian.”Prine was married three times, and appreciated a relationship that lasted. In 1999, he and Iris DeMent shared vocals on the classic title track of his album “In Spite of Ourselves,” a ribald tribute to an old married couple.Prine preferred songs about feelings to topical music, but he did respond at times to the day’s headlines. Prine’s parents had moved to suburban Chicago from Paradise, a coal town ravaged by strip mining that inspired one of his most cutting protest songs, “Paradise.” It appeared on his first album, along with “Your Flag Decal Won’t Get You Into Heaven Anymore,” which criticized what he saw as false patriotism surrounding the Vietnam War.Many years later, as President George W. Bush sent soldiers to war, Prine had a song for that, too. In “Some Humans Ain’t Human,” he wrote: “You’re feeling your freedom, and the world’s off your back, some cowboy from Texas, starts his own war in Iraq.”Prine’s off-hand charisma made him a natural for movies. He appeared in the John Mellencamp film “Falling From Grace,” and in Billy Bob Thornton’s “Daddy and Them.” His other Grammy Awards include Best Contemporary Folk Recording for his 1991 album “The Missing Years,” with guest vocalists including Raitt, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen and Phil Everly. He won Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004 for “Beautiful Dreamer.”Prine didn’t let illness stop him from performing or recording. In 2013, long after surviving throat cancer, he was diagnosed with an unrelated and operable form of lung cancer, but he bounced back from that, too, often sharing the stage with DeMent and other younger artists. On the playful talking blues “When I Get to Heaven,” from the 2018 album “The Tree of Forgiveness,” he vowed to have the last laugh for all eternity.

The U.S. Army has suspended travel for American soldiers and their families to and from two countries.

Above video: Life under coronavirus travel quarantine in Italy's northThe U.S. Army has suspended travel for American soldiers and their families to and from South Korea and Italy amid mounting concern over the spread of the novel coronavirus."Out of an abundance of caution, Headquarters, Department of the Army has made the decision to stop movement and delay travel of Soldiers stationed in Italy and Korea, which have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control as alert level three for COVID-19," according to an order Sunday by the U.S. Army.On Friday, a U.S. Navy sailor stationed in Naples, Italy, became the first U.S. service member stationed in Europe to test positive for the coronavirus. And in a separate case last month, a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea tested positive — the first U.S. service member to do so.In an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus among the armed forces, multiple military branches have begun screening new recruits.While recruits are always screened for health issues, the coronavirus is now a particular concern for the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Army, which have implemented new screening procedures as the virus spreads.

Oil plunges 25% as another virus-fueled trading week begins
.W
Demand for energy is falling as people cut back on travel. The worry is the new coronavirus will slow economies sharply, meaning even less demand.

Oil prices are plunging amid concern a dispute among producers could lead a global economy weakened by COVID-19 to be awash in an oversupply of crude.Brent crude, the international standard, lost $11.44, or 25.3%, to $33.83 per barrel in electronic trading in London.

Under quarantine, 13-year-old New Yorker has a bar mitzvah over video chat

The ceremony was virtually attended by about 250 people.

After going to a bat mitzvah attended by a coronavirus patient, students at a private New York City school were asked to self-quarantine, but the order came at a steep cost for Joseph Hershkowitz, 13, who was planning to celebrate his own bar mitzvah.Rabbi Binyamin Krauss, Hershkowitz's principal at Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy in the Bronx, offered the teenager a modern solution.SAR Academy had been holding classes by video conference after the possible coronavirus exposure. Krauss' wife suggested: Why not a virtual bar mitzvah?"We ended up having a Zoom bar mitzvah," Krauss said, referring to the video conference tool the school has been using.The ceremony, which took place Thursday morning, was virtually attended by about 250 people, the rabbi said.The large crowd required some managing. At one point, a junior high teacher on the call took charge by muting chatty students.While Krauss officiated from a distance, Hershkowitz read a portion of the Torah with his immediate family. Afterward, Hershkowitz's parents blessed their son.At the end of the ceremony, the teacher unmuted the other participants. The video call rotated through callers congratulating Hershkowitz with a hearty round of "Mazel tov." Many were his classmates, under quarantine in their family's homes, dressed in sweatshirts and pajamas."Here we are, so thankful that we can do this today," Joseph's mother, Karen, said at the end of the call. "We're just so proud to be sharing this, wherever we are, however we can."The novel coronavirus has spread throughout the U.S. Hundreds of people have tested positive for the virus, which as of Sunday evening, had killed 21 people.The virus started its U.S. spread in Washington, but on Saturday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced more cases. The state had more than 100 cases as of early Sunday afternoon.Cuomo has declared a state of emergency."We want to keep testing and finding more people who are testing positive because that's how you contain the outbreak: Find the person who got infected, quarantine them and reduce the infection rate," Cuomo said in a news release.The governor has asked more than 2,500 people in New York to self-quarantine as officials search for anyone who may have come in contact with ill residents.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte says travel restrictions are being imposed nationwide to try to stop the spread of the spread of coronavirus.Conte said Monday night that a new government decree will require all people in Italy to demonstrate a need to work, health conditions or other limited reasons to travel outside the areas where they live.The restrictions will take effect on Tuesday and — like those in northern Italy — will last until April 3., he said."There won't be just a red zone,'' Conte told reporters, referring to the quarantine order he signed for a vast swath of northern Italy with a population of 16 million over the weekend."There will be Italy" as a protected area, he said.The premier also took to task the young people in much of Italy who have been gathering at night to drink and have a good time during the public health emergency that started Feb. 21."This night life...we can't allow this anymore," Conte said.Pubs had been closed in northern Italy, with eateries and cafes also ordered to close at dusk.

After losing her mom to cancer, woman finds healing, love by keeping a promise
.W
A woman made a promise to her dying mother. She kept it, and found new love in the process.

For Natalie Reilly, Valentine's Day 2016 was grim. The divorcee was at home nursing her mother through a 19th round of chemotherapy."She was not eating, and she was not coming out of her room," Reilly remembered of her once-vibrant mom. "It was really hard for me -- she was the strongest woman I knew."In the midst of feeling sad and sorry for herself, Reilly drew inspiration from her mother's strength. A new idea dawned."I thought to myself: 'This is not who she raised me to be,'" she told CNN.  "I said, 'We are not going to feel sorry for ourselves.  We are going to do something for our community.'"Mother and daughter spent the next three hours writing "thank you" cards and handing them out to veterans and first responders.Their first note went to a Korean War vet at a grocery store. He was deeply touched by their kindness.By the time they were done, her mother was laughing and smiling. The notes became their ongoing project.As their mission touched more people, her mom's health continued to decline, eventually requiring hospice care.A deathbed promiseOn her deathbed, Reilly's mother asked her to keep spreading love through the notes. She also had another message for her daughter."Mom said, 'When God takes something, he usually gives you something in return and it's something bigger and better.'"Two years ago, Reilly's mother died. The dutiful daughter continued writing notes each day."The night my mom died, when she started to slip away, I felt like I had something to run to," she said.She feels her mother's presence in each and every letter.Over time, her mission to spread gratitude and joy has inspired others to join in, writing notes to veterans, first responders, nurses, teachers and other people making a difference.Each note has the hashtag #NothingButLoveNotes.She guesses at least 20,000 notes have been handed out by her community of writers.Through her love notes, new opportunities have opened up for Reilly. She has been invited to speak at businesses and schools. She was even made honorary football captain of a high school team. A few of her love note recipients consistently join her on talks.Related: Woman beats rare uterine cancer, gives birth to miracle babyA chance at loveHaving been divorced since 2000, Reilly said she was single for a long time. Although her mission of handing out notes to first responders and vets created opportunities to be around men -- she was against using her initiative to look for dates."I didn't want others to misconstrue my intention. My intentions are pure," she said.At a football game, a mutual friend introduced her to a retired cop. Reilly handed him a personalized note as a way to thank him for his service.  There, at the game, the two struck up a conversation about a book the officer was writing. Reilly, herself a writer and editor, offered to help."He's not like anyone that I have ever met. He pushes me to be better. I couldn't be any luckier," she said.Five months ago, Reilly moved from Arizona to join her boyfriend who now lives on the West Coast.What comes nextWith love by her side, Reilly has no intention of slowing down her mission. As she decides the next step for "Nothing But Love Notes," Reilly hopes her initiative will go on. In the meantime, she continues to find joy in spreading love one note at a time with one clear message in mind."I want to promote gratitude," she says of her notes to first responders and veterans."It's a reminder that they are loved and we appreciate all that they do for us."

A Pennsylvania clinic is bringing the Amish drive-thru coronavirus testing for horse and buggies
.W
A small clinic in central Pennsylvania has set up drive-thru coronavirus testing that accommodates horse and buggies for its local Amish and Mennonite communities.

A small clinic in central Pennsylvania has set up drive-thru coronavirus testing that accommodates horse and buggies for its local Amish and Mennonite communities.The Central Pennsylvania Clinic in Belleville, a town known for its majority Amish and Mennonite population, is one of the only coronavirus testing facilities in the area.Related video above: Pennsylvania Amish community impacted by restrictions aimed at slowing coronavirus spreadThe clinic's founder and medical director, Dr. D. Holmes Morton, collaborated with Regina Lamendella, the co-founder of a start-up which detects and diagnoses infectious diseases, to develop a new way to test for the virus.Medical personnel at the clinic collect the swab samples before sending them to the lab at Lamendella's company, Contamination Source Identification (CSI), to be processed. Since launching drive-through testing on April 1, the clinic provided nearly 65 coronavirus tests.While the clinic is also utilizing the currently available FDA-approved RT-qPCR test, Lamendella said the test has "as little as 66% sensitivity" and can fail to detect the virus in asymptomatic carriers.So the lab developed and validated their own test that uses rapid, untargeted mRNA sequencing — along with the virus' RT-qPCR to quickly and accurately detect the virus."Our test, the CSI-Dx test system, directly detects the viral genome of COVID-19," Lamendella, who is also a biology professor at Juniata College, told CNN."With this test, we're able to see the entire viral genome and how it's changing and what strains are floating around. Keeping up with that evolution of the pathogen is going to be very important because we know the type of pathogen it is, an RNA virus, can change very quickly."While most coronavirus tests currently available take "approximately one week" for results to become available, Lamendella said her lab returns test results in 19 hours or less, thanks to their RAPID-Dx data analysis tool, developed by co-founder Justin Wright.And unlike most testing facilities, the CSI lab is also equipped and staffed to perform and process several hundred tests every day.Expanding testing to asymptomatic carriersAlthough most hospitals only test patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, Lamendella and Morton are doing their best to identify asymptomatic carriers of the virus who don't know they're positive."We all know from experience that the epidemic is really perpetuated by people who are relatively asymptomatic but still infectious," Morton told CNN."What we're trying to do is get ahead of the infection in this area by offering testing at low costs, particularly within the Amish community. This is also to educate them about the risk of having gatherings, whether its church or weddings or funerals."Recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don't have symptoms. Coronavirus is also twice as contagious as the flu; a person with coronavirus can infect "4 to 10 other people," Morton said, adding that this means social gatherings could turn fatal fast.For communities like the Amish and Mennonites, who regularly hold large social gatherings, it is critical to educate them on the importance of maintaining social distancing precautions — as well as the importance of getting tested."They are an especially at-risk community. Culturally they're somewhat isolated from the news media. So they aren't constantly watching the news or reading the newspaper, while those of us who are immersed in the news have become remarkable well-informed scientifically," Morton, who specializes in genetic disorders of Amish and Mennonite children, said."Another thing that makes them vulnerable is how social they are. When they have church, they have 300 people crowded together in a little farmhouse. From the point of view of an infection like this, this is a disaster."CSI now hopes to partner up with other local hospitals and clinics who don't have access to the lab's specialized research equipment to continue expanding the availability of coronavirus testing.There are more than 14,900 confirmed coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania. The entire state is under a stay at home order through April 30.                        A small clinic in central Pennsylvania has set up drive-thru coronavirus testing that accommodates horse and buggies for its local Amish and Mennonite communities. The Central Pennsylvania Clinic in Belleville, a town known for its majority Amish and Mennonite population, is one of the only coronavirus testing facilities in the area.                              Advertisement                       Related video above: Pennsylvania Amish community impacted by restrictions aimed at slowing coronavirus spread The clinic's founder and medical director, Dr. D. Holmes Morton, collaborated with Regina Lamendella, the co-founder of a start-up which detects and diagnoses infectious diseases, to develop a new way to test for the virus. Medical personnel at the clinic collect the swab samples before sending them to the lab at Lamendella's company, Contamination Source Identification (CSI), to be processed. Since launching drive-through testing on April 1, the clinic provided nearly 65 coronavirus tests. While the clinic is also utilizing the currently available FDA-approved RT-qPCR test, Lamendella said the test has "as little as 66% sensitivity" and can fail to detect the virus in asymptomatic carriers. So the lab developed and validated their own test that uses rapid, untargeted mRNA sequencing — along with the virus' RT-qPCR to quickly and accurately detect the virus. "Our test, the CSI-Dx test system, directly detects the viral genome of COVID-19," Lamendella, who is also a biology professor at Juniata College, told CNN. "With this test, we're able to see the entire viral genome and how it's changing and what strains are floating around. Keeping up with that evolution of the pathogen is going to be very important because we know the type of pathogen it is, an RNA virus, can change very quickly." While most coronavirus tests currently available take "approximately one week" for results to become available, Lamendella said her lab returns test results in 19 hours or less, thanks to their RAPID-Dx data analysis tool, developed by co-founder Justin Wright. And unlike most testing facilities, the CSI lab is also equipped and staffed to perform and process several hundred tests every day.               Expanding testing to asymptomatic carriers Although most hospitals only test patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, Lamendella and Morton are doing their best to identify asymptomatic carriers of the virus who don't know they're positive. "We all know from experience that the epidemic is really perpetuated by people who are relatively asymptomatic but still infectious," Morton told CNN. "What we're trying to do is get ahead of the infection in this area by offering testing at low costs, particularly within the Amish community. This is also to educate them about the risk of having gatherings, whether its church or weddings or funerals." Recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don't have symptoms.                                                                                                        New estimates show 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don't even have symptoms and can infect others blindly                          Coronavirus is also twice as contagious as the flu; a person with coronavirus can infect "4 to 10 other people," Morton said, adding that this means social gatherings could turn fatal fast. For communities like the Amish and Mennonites, who regularly hold large social gatherings, it is critical to educate them on the importance of maintaining social distancing precautions — as well as the importance of getting tested. "They are an especially at-risk community. Culturally they're somewhat isolated from the news media. So they aren't constantly watching the news or reading the newspaper, while those of us who are immersed in the news have become remarkable well-informed scientifically," Morton, who specializes in genetic disorders of Amish and Mennonite children, said. "Another thing that makes them vulnerable is how social they are. When they have church, they have 300 people crowded together in a little farmhouse. From the point of view of an infection like this, this is a disaster." CSI now hopes to partner up with other local hospitals and clinics who don't have access to the lab's specialized research equipment to continue expanding the availability of coronavirus testing. There are more than 14,900 confirmed coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania. The entire state is under a stay at home order through April 30.

Some ER doctors are losing pay and hours even as coronavirus rages
.W
Though many hospitals are seeing more very sick coronavirus victims, they have had to sharply curtail some elective surgeries and have temporarily lost many other patients as Americans stay home and skip all but the most urgent care.

Many emergency room doctors around the country are seeing their hours, pay and benefits cut, even as the coronavirus overwhelms hospitals in New York City and other hotspots.Though many hospitals are seeing more very sick coronavirus victims, they have had to sharply curtail their more lucrative elective surgeries and have temporarily lost many other patients as Americans stay home and skip all but the most urgent care.As a result, hospitals as well as other medical facilities and physician staffing companies nationwide are furloughing thousands of workers or taking other steps to conserve cash as the pandemic wreaks havoc on their finances.The recent $2.2 trillion congressional stimulus bill created a $100 billion fund to reimburse hospitals and other health providers to compensate them for additional expenses and lost revenue due to the coronavirus. Hospitals expect to get about $65 billion, but it's still unclear how all the money will be allocated.The White House said last week some of the fund will reimburse hospitals for treating uninsured coronavirus patients, which did not sit well with the main hospital lobbying group.Meanwhile, some front-line medical workers are risking their lives while also making financial sacrifices.ER doctors getting hitOne ER doctor at a Virginia hospital told CNN that hours are being cut and pay will go down because fewer patients are coming through the door — though many who are arriving are extremely ill with the virus and many have to be intubated. Part of doctors' earnings at the hospital depend on how many patients they see."I'm putting my life on the line. I'm risking my family's health by going to work. I don't love the idea that I'm getting paid less to do that," said the doctor, who works for Envision Healthcare, a medical staffing company, but did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal at work. "But I'd rather get paid a little less and have people stay home."Envision, which is owned by the private equity firm KKR and employs 27,000 providers nationwide, said in a statement that it is "surging clinicians in high patient volume areas and adjusting accordingly in lower patient volume areas." It noted that the postponement of elective procedures and social distancing measures have resulted in lower volumes for many of its clinicians. Another ER physician who works in Washington, D.C., learned on National Doctor's Day last week that the doctor's employer, Alteon Health, planned to cut its 401(k) retirement plan match and health savings account contribution, as well as take away paid time off.Last week, the doctor saw just five to 10 patients during one shift, as opposed to 25 to 30 people prior to the outbreak, though the numbers picked up this week."I felt like it was a slap in the face to frontline workers," said the doctor, who asked not to be identified. "People are saying we should be getting hazard pay. Then on Doctor's Day, they take away contributions that would help us pay for health care and plan for retirement and take vacation from this all." Alteon, which is owned by two investment firms, later walked back some of the changes after ProPublica reported the plans. It promised to fully catch up on the 401(k) match once the pandemic passes, and clinicians will continue to earn paid time off, though it must be approved on a case-by-case basis.The company, which employs 1,800 clinicians at 150 hospitals, also won't cut the compensation of facility medical directors and regional medical directors by 20%, though executives will reduce their pay by a quarter.However, it will transition some providers from salaried to hourly. "The best thing for their health and safety is to have them home resting with their families and preparing for surges," Dr. Steve Holtzclaw, Alteon's CEO, wrote to employees Sunday.To direct resources to areas with high coronavirus caseloads, "we have to have some level of staffing flexibility given the material decline in patient volumes across our locations," Holtzclaw wrote.Meanwhile, another medical staffing firm, TeamHealth, last week emailed anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, asking them to volunteer for furloughs for up to 90 days.The anesthesiologist who shared the email with CNN was shocked that these cuts are coming at a time when more and more coronavirus patients are arriving at hospitals in need of critical care treatment."We're the doctors who are doing the riskiest frontline work by intubating," said the anesthesiologist, who also requested anonymity. "We're inches away from them and then putting them on ventilators."A TeamHealth spokesman told CNN anesthesia services are down by 65%, after authorities mandated the cancellation of elective procedures.TeamHealth, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2016, is also cutting hours of ER physicians in areas where fewer patients are going to the hospital, a spokesman confirmed. More than 100 members of senior TeamHealth leaders agreed to pay cuts.Hospitals furloughing workersHospitals around the country are furloughing staff to try to save money.Boston Medical Center Health System last week furloughed about 700 employees, roughly 10% of its workforce. The positions are mostly in administration. The move was first reported in The Boston Globe.The hospital system has lost about $5 million in weekly revenue because elective surgeries and non-urgent visits have been postponed, a spokeswoman said. It typically has 4,000 outpatient visits daily.In Florida, Sarasota Memorial Health Care System said Friday that temporary furloughs and reduced hours for employees would start the following week. A drastic drop in non-emergency procedures and hospital inpatients caused a $16 million reduction in March revenue, with an even greater expected financial hit in April and May, the hospital said in a statement online.The hospital system is not cutting back nursing care or staff who are needed to support patient care or essential services, a hospital spokeswoman said. But senior executives will see their pay reduced.Sarasota Memorial is taking these cost-cutting steps because it has had to "redirect funds, resources and equipment to respond to the pandemic, planning for surge needs, purchasing additional supplies, and preparing and staffing an increasing number of isolation rooms throughout the hospital," the statement said.Meanwhile, Trinity Health announced last week it will furlough at least 2,500 employees at eight hospitals in Michigan in the coming weeks, a spokeswoman said.The Catholic health system, which has 92 hospitals in nearly two dozen states, has not completed its staffing plans nationwide so the total number of furloughs will increase, a spokeswoman said. Executives are also taking pay cuts."This pandemic has created a serious disruption to Trinity Health's operations, colleagues, and the people we serve," Michael Slubowski, the system's CEO, said in a statement. "Outpatient and home care services represent a large portion of health system's revenues and they are decreasing significantly. This is understandable because of orders by state and federal governments to stop elective surgeries — and because many healthy patients are unable to visit the doctor at this time."

Fact Check: The arguments for and against widespread face mask use during the coronavirus outbreak
.W
It’s a seemingly simple question that has divided experts and nations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak: Should members of the public who aren’t sick use face masks to limit the spread of the disease?

Posted on April 6, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.It’s a seemingly simple question that has divided experts and nations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak: Should members of the public who aren’t sick use face masks to limit the spread of the disease?For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintained that the only people who needed to wear face masks were people who were ill or those who were treating them. That notion stemmed from the idea that basic medical masks do little to protect wearers, and instead primarily prevent sick people from spewing infectious droplets from their noses and mouths. Plus, limited supplies needed to be prioritized for frontline health workers. The World Health Organization agreed.But some countries took a different tack, suggesting and even requiring the use of masks in certain instances when people were outside their homes. Many scientists, too, began to suggest that a more widespread mask policy might be a good idea.Then, after days of speculation, President Donald Trump announced on April 3 that the CDC was recommending that people use cloth face coverings in crowded places, even as he emphasized the measure was voluntary and said he would not be following it.“So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing,” he said. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it.”Citing new data that a “significant portion” of people infected with the novel coronavirus can spread the virus to others even when they don’t have symptoms, the agency revised its recommendation, saying that people should wear cloth face coverings “whenever people must go into public settings.” “A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,” the updated CDC website now reads. “This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.”While the tide has turned toward a more pro-mask approach in the U.S., some experts have reservations about the policy. Cloth masks are poorly studied, and there isn’t much real-world evidence to recommend medical masks to the general public. Such guidelines could also exacerbate shortages of medical masks or backfire if people don’t wear their coverings properly or if they are lulled into a false sense of security.At the same time, other scientists point to lab studies that indicate a broader adoption of masks, even of less effective do-it-yourself models, could still be helpful. And it’s possible widespread mask use could keep people from touching their faces and help convey the severity of the pandemic.We’ll review some of the research and thinking behind face masks and explain why opinions are divided. But first, it’s important to recognize that despite the debate, on the most important issues, most experts agree:If there is a benefit to having healthy people mask up, the effect is likely to be small. No one should assume they are protected by a face mask, and it’s critical that people continue to stay six feet away from others and keep washing their hands. As the CDC says, cloth coverings are “not a substitute” for social distancing.Health care workers should receive priority on medical masks, and ideally should be using N95 respirators when treating people with COVID-19.What Masks DoDepending on the design, masks can limit the spread of a disease from an infected person in what’s called source control, and/or they can protect the wearer from becoming infected.In the case of COVID-19, transmission of the virus is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets, which can land in other people’s mouths or noses when infected people cough or sneeze. The droplets can also contaminate surfaces that others then touch before touching their faces. Here, basic surgical masks — loose-fitting, disposable masks — might be helpful because if someone who is sick is wearing one, their infectious droplets could be trapped in the mask. Doctors and nurses wearing such masks may also be protected somewhat since they’re likely to be coughed or sneezed on.But researchers also suspect the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can linger in the air in very small droplets known as aerosols, which can be inhaled by people nearby. A study published on March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission “plausible,” finding in an experiment that the virus “remained viable” in machine-generated aerosols for up to three hours, although half of the particles weren’t infectious after about an hour. There’s not a lot of clarity yet about how much of a role this mechanism plays in spreading the virus — and it’s unlikely that this allows the virus to travel long distances — but scientists are increasingly confident that it can happen to some degree. “I believe that it is likely that all of the routes of transmission come into play here,” said occupational health professor Margaret Sietsema of the University of Illinois at Chicago, “meaning the disease can be inhaled and therefore the best line of defense is a respirator.” Respirators include the oft-cited N95 masks, which are disposable, tight-fitting masks that create a seal on the face and include a specialized filter that captures at least 95% of the airborne particles that pass through it. (To avoid confusion, from here on out, we will not refer to any respirator as a mask.) In contrast to the N95s, surgical masks are not intended to provide protection against aerosols. As a CDC blog explains, surgical masks “are designed to provide barrier protection against droplets, however they are not regulated for particulate filtration efficiency and they do not form an adequate seal to the wearer’s face to be relied upon for respiratory protection.”Limited Evidence, Divergent ViewsSietsema, who recently reviewed the evidence on masks for the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, recommends N95 respirators for health care workers interacting with COVID-19 patients, but doesn’t think there’s enough evidence to support a broader masking policy that includes healthy people.Masks might be able to reduce transmission by capturing the larger droplets infected people spew, but that only applies if a person is symptomatic, she said, and she argues that anyone with symptoms shouldn’t be in public spaces anyway.“I do not believe a mask would reduce transmission prior to being symptomatic because air will never choose a path of more resistance (going through the mask) – it will simply go around the mask,” she said in an email.She also expressed concern that mask recommendations would lead people to ease up on social distancing and could complicate efforts to preserve surgical masks for frontline health care workers.Other scientists, however, disagree, and say that while masks won’t be fully effective, they are likely to be better than nothing.Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, doesn’t buy the idea that surgical masks have no utility for the general public.“Certainly I could believe they would work /better/ when used by healthcare workers, particularly when used in combination with other protective equipment and behaviors,” he said in an email, “but it is a big jump to say they are essential when worn by healthcare workers but useless when worn by others.”In a just-published study Cowling co-authored in Nature Medicine, researchers found that surgical masks reduced the amount of respiratory virus people expelled while breathing and coughing into a specialized machine.Previously, another study by Cowling and others using a similar setup found that surgical masks reduced the amount of influenza RNA researchers could detect from both small and larger respiratory droplets. The effect was much stronger for larger droplets, but the study indicates the masks can reduce aerosols to a limited degree.These types of studies suggest surgical masks can limit the spread of respiratory viruses in theory, but they are still a step away from showing that masks are an effective public health measure in the general population.After all, in practical use, masks could be detrimental if people let up on social distancing, end up touching their faces more, or if they constantly touch the outside of the mask, which could be contaminated.Even those who support wider public mask use acknowledge that this type of direct evidence is lacking. In a Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary article advocating more “rational” use of face masks to fight COVID-19, the authors described the available evidence as “scarce.”While some studies have evaluated a variety of face masks in hospitals or other heath care contexts, relatively few have tested whether face masks are effective in the community — and the ones that do exist have been inconsistent or have not observed large effects.Cowling, for instance, told us the best evidence would come from randomized controlled trials, and directed us to his systematic review of 10 trials testing face masks for their ability to limit flu transmission in places such as households or dorms. Although a number of the trials struggled with getting people to actually wear the masks — suggesting that with higher compliance, there might be an impact — the review found “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.” Many of the trials, too, were too small to come to any firm conclusions. “Based on the summary of the randomized control trials, there may be some, but not very large, effects,” said Elaine Shuo Feng, a statistician and epidemiologist at the University of Oxford and the lead author of the Lancet Respiratory Medicine commentary, in an interview.Still, she thought it was prudent for countries to begin considering face masks. “Not enough evidence doesn’t mean the intervention itself is not effective,” Feng said. “And in this situation, I think the best way is to rely on all the available non-pharmaceutical interventions.”Cloth and DIY MasksCompared with surgical masks or respirators, very little research has been done on cloth masks.In 2015, researchers published the first randomized controlled trial of cloth masks, and found that hospital workers in Vietnam were 13 times more likely to come down with an influenza-like illness when wearing a cloth mask rather than a disposable surgical one.The cloth mask group also had higher rates of respiratory infection than the control group, which sometimes wore surgical masks per the hospitals’ standard practice. However, because there wasn’t a group that wore no masks at all, the researchers couldn’t tell whether cloth masks still might have provided some protection to wearers.“he finding of a much higher rate of infection in the cloth mask arm,” the authors wrote, “could be interpreted as harm caused by cloth masks, efficacy of medical masks, or most likely a combination of both.”A few other studies have looked into how well certain fabrics or designs fare in the lab at blocking droplet and particle transmission. But as the authors of the trial in Vietnam noted in an article addressing their paper’s relevance to COVID-19, none of these masks have been tested in a clinical trial.A 2013 study testing household materials for masks found that cotton T-shirts likely had some ability to filter out bacteria and viruses, but the masks were far less effective than surgical masks. The group concluded that a homemade mask would be better than no mask, but “should only be considered as a last resort.”In a more rigorous 2010 test, researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health bombarded T-shirts, towels, sweatshirts and scarves with nanoparticles to evaluate the filtration potential of DIY mask fabrics. While the materials’ performance paled in comparison to an N95 respirator and the authors noted that they provide “only marginal respiratory protection,” most fabrics caught at least some of the particles.Linsey Marr, a Virginia Tech engineering professor who studies virus transmission, cautioned that people should not rely on homemade masks to prevent inhalation of viruses in the air, but she had some practical tips for those pursuing their own designs.“The material should be thick and densely woven, like a kitchen towel or heavyweight t-shirt, and the mask should fit tightly around the nose and mouth with no gaps,” she told us in an email.As the National Academy of Sciences explains in a 2006 report on the possible use of improvised face masks during a pandemic, a tighter fabric structure may do a better job of filtration, but does have some trade-offs. “s the tightness of the structure increases, the breathing resistance increases, thereby affecting the user’s comfort while using the device,” the report says, noting this “may affect usage.”If You Wear a MaskFor those who choose to wear a mask, Feng recommended learning the proper technique to reduce accidental infection from the mask itself. As demonstrated in a WHO video, the key is to not to touch the outside of the mask — and to wash your hands if you do.The CDC also offers advice and a few patterns for those creating their own masks.But most critically, don’t think a mask protects you or exempts you from social distancing or hand washing. As Feng told us, it’s “better to stay home.”                        Posted on April 6, 2020                                                                                                           Advertisement                       We are collaborating with  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts. It’s a seemingly simple question that has divided experts and nations since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak: Should members of the public who aren’t sick use face masks to limit the spread of the disease? For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  maintained  that the only people who needed to wear face masks were people who were ill or those who were treating them. That notion stemmed from the idea that basic medical masks do little to protect wearers, and instead primarily prevent sick people from spewing infectious droplets from their noses and mouths. Plus, limited supplies needed to be prioritized for frontline health workers. The World Health Organization  agreed . But some countries took a different tack,  suggesting  and  even   requiring  the use of masks in certain instances when people were outside their homes. Many scientists, too,  began  to suggest that a more widespread mask policy might be a good idea. Then, after days of  speculation , President Donald Trump  announced  on April 3 that the CDC was  recommending  that people use cloth face coverings in crowded places, even as he emphasized the measure was voluntary and said he would not be following it. “So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing,” he said. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it.” Citing new data that a “significant portion” of people infected with the novel coronavirus can spread the virus to others even when they don’t have symptoms, the agency  revised   its   recommendation , saying that people should wear cloth face coverings “whenever people must go into public settings.”  “A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,” the updated CDC website now  reads . “This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.” While the tide has turned toward a more pro-mask approach in the U.S., some experts have reservations about the policy.

Without classes, some high school students answer call to work at Wisconsin polling site
.W
Concerns over coronavirus kept many of Wisconsin's elderly poll workers at home, which led one city to call on a previously untapped resource: high school students, who are less susceptible to coronavirus complications.

Concerns over coronavirus kept many of Wisconsin's elderly poll workers at home, which led one city to call on a previously untapped resource: high school students, who are less susceptible to coronavirus complications. Many of them answered the call and worked Tuesday in the city of Brookfield's only polling location, the new convention center. Brookfield Central sophomore Madeline Beug-Hoffman said her parents were supportive, and somewhat concerned, about her filling an important Election Day role for the city of Brookfield."They said they didn't have enough poll workers and that they needed help because the coronavirus affects the elderly most, so they needed people to come volunteer and work the polls," Beug-Hoffman said."Usually I'm the youngest one, so yeah, I do like it," long-time poll worker Tim Gramling said. "It's good to see a younger group come through."This time around, some of the workers aren't even old enough to vote."It feels like you're actually giving back to the community in a big way," Brookfield East junior Langston Ford said. "I think kids are motivated because they want the elderly to stay home," Brookfield East junior Natalie Karrels said. The students said they're learning important lessons even with schools closed by COVID-19."I think it's good to be a public service or poll worker, and I'm really interested in government, so this is a way to get behind the scenes and see how things work," Karrels said. The Brookfield mayor said there are five members of the National Guard at the one Brookfield polling place and twice as many high school students.              BROOKFIELD, Wis.

Coronavirus symptoms: 10 key indicators and what to do
.W
Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.

Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms it causes.Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have COVID-19 — and what to do to protect yourself and your family.1. Shortness of breathShortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of COVID-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say."If there's any shortness of breath, immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris."If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added.The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for COVID-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen.Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.2. FeverFever is a key sign of COVID-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees, experts say not to fixate on a number.CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people."I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall. Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees."There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh."We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever."Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening."Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained."One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever."3. Dry CoughCoughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough."It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained.The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest."It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added.A report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs.4. Chills and body aches"The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1.'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family."I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said.Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.One possible sign that you might have COVID-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.5. Sudden confusionSpeaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.6. Digestive issuesAt first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed."In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said.The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.7. Pink eyeResearch from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with COVID-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye.Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.8. Loss of smell and tasteIn mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of COVID-19."What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day."It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure — but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones.""Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to ENT UK, a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom.Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.9. FatigueFor some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings."I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours."Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from COVID-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.10. Headache, sore throat, congestionThe WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of COVID-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion.Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of COVID-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu — after all, they can cause fever and cough too.So what should you do?"At this moment, the current guidance — and this may change — is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.In general, COVID-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder."Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises.To be clear, you are at higher risk — even if you are young — if you have underlying health issues."People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said.A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the U.S., are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be COVID-19 or not.How to be evaluatedIf you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say."We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue," Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. "However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms — fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing — reach out to be evaluated."If you do have those three signs, where should you go?"If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients," Harris said."If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers," Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call."If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly," Schaffer said. "It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do."                        Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms it causes.                              Advertisement                       Fever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual. Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have COVID-19 — and what to do to protect yourself and your family. 1. Shortness of breath Shortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of COVID-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act   quickly, experts say. "If there's any shortness of breath, immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department," said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris. "If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911," Harris added. The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for COVID-19 as a "persistent pain or pressure in the chest," and "bluish lips or face," which can indicate a lack of oxygen. Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says. 2. Fever Fever is a key sign of COVID-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees, experts say not to fixate on a number. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people. "I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm," Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.  Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees. "There are many misconceptions about fever," said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.                                                                                                            Do I have a fever? How to take your own temperature accurately                          "We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree," Williams said, adding that for most people "99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever." Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening. "Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal," Schaffner explained. "One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever." 3. Dry Cough Coughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough. "It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated," Schaffner explained. The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest. "It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated," Schaffner added. A  report  put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs. 4. Chills and body aches "The beast comes out at night," said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1. 'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors," he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family. "I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky," Cuomo said. Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame. One possible sign that you might have COVID-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen. 5. Sudden confusion Speaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain,  the CDC  says to seek help immediately. 6. Digestive issues At first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed. "In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients," Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program. Overall, "I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have," Gupta said. The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems. 7. Pink eye Research from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with COVID-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.                                                                                                                 Doctors say pink eye with other key symptoms may represent COVID-19 cases                          But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same. Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. 8. Loss of smell and taste In mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of COVID-19. "What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day. "It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure — but it's clearly something to look out for," Gupta said. "Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones." "Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms," according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.                     A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia. It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to  ENT UK , a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom. Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the "jellybean test" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine. 9. Fatigue For some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO  report  found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue. Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings. "I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by," Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. "I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours." Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from COVID-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks. 10. Headache, sore throat, congestion The WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of COVID-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion. Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of COVID-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion. Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu — after all, they can cause fever and cough too. So what should you do? "At this moment, the current guidance — and this may change — is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.

Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC. It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.                                                                                                       'It's been really scary': Expectant mothers prepare for childbirth as coronavirus forces hospitals to make changes                          In general, COVID-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder. "Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness," the CDC advises. To be clear, you are at higher risk — even if you are young — if you have underlying health issues. "People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age," Schaffner said. A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the U.S., are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be COVID-19 or not. How to be evaluated If you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.

VIDEO: Savannah mayor helps break up fight at Walmart
.W
"In these difficult times, the only thing we should be fighting is COVID-19," Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said.

A disturbing scene at a Georgia Walmart — a fight caught on camera and Savannah's mayor there to help break it up. The incident was captured on video: a Friday night fight breaking out in the aisles of Walmart with Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, also at the scene.  During a Facebook Live on Friday night, Johnson criticized Governor Brian Kemp's recent orders and made mention of the fight scene."I was in there tonight. Yes, I was in there," Johnson said. Johnson has repeatedly expressed frustration about citizens refusing to social distance or follow the rules he and other leaders have laid out to slow the spread of coronavirus."We knew last Saturday that Walmart was like the club," Johnson said.Johnson thinks the lack of distancing is especially true when people go shopping.  The need to enforce social distancing is the reason Walmart and similar retailers have imposed new guidelines to enter and exit the store.The video of this fight was taken before those rules went into effect and Walmart had no comment on the matter.But Johnson used this sad scene as a way to reinforce a message he's been saying for a while."I was in Walmart on Montgomery Crossroads when multiple fights broke out," Johnson said.  "I assisted where I could in diffusing the incident, and I thank the wonderful team at Walmart who managed this situation without injury.  In these difficult times, the only thing we should be fighting is COVID-19, and the only message that should become viral is to stay home."             SAVANNAH, Ga.

One of the latest victims of the coronavirus was a 22-year-old Oklahoma man who had made multiple trips to area medical facilities before he was tested.

One of the latest victims of the coronavirus was a 22-year-old Oklahoma man who had made multiple trips to area medical facilities before he was tested.Krystal Sauz told Fox 23 that it took three trips to three different facilities before her husband, Israel Sauz, ever got tested for the coronavirus. She said he was initially sent home from a Broken Arrow hospital with a fever, cough and other symptoms and was diagnosed with a stomach virus.Days later and after the symptoms continued, Israel Sauz was told at a clinic that he had a virus and was prescribed antibiotics. Krystal Sauz told the Tulsa-area television station that she pushed to have her husband tested for the coronavirus but was denied.Israel Sauz got to spend a week with his and his wife's newborn child before he started developing a fever and cough. Krystal Sauz and their child went to her parents' house to protect their health, and she made regular visits back to help her husband at his and his parents' home. Things took a turn March 29 when Israel Sauz had a fever reaching 104 degrees. He was too weak to walk, had shallow breathing and felt like throwing up.Krystal Sauz contacted the state's coronavirus hotline, which told her to contact a hospital and tell staff there that the hotline recommended for her husband to be tested for COVID-19. She took him to Saint Francis Hospital, where he tested positive and was put on a ventilator the next day. Israel Sauz told his wife over the phone he was scared but it was in God's hands. She told him she loved him.Video above: Family mourns loss of 31-year-old man killed by coronavirus Despite showing improvements over the next few days, Krystal Sauz received a call early Sunday saying that her husband may not make it. She got to visit him briefly in the hospital, standing outside a glass window to his room.Israel Sauz was pronounced dead at 10 p.m. Sunday.“My heart breaks for that 22-year-old person there in Tulsa,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said during a news conference Tuesday. “And I heard … that he had gone into the hospital and couldn’t get tested. What specifically happened and what hospital he went to and why they didn’t test him, it just breaks my heart.”             TULSA, Okla.

Teen pilot flies medical supplies to rural hospitals

He's turned his flying lessons into missions of mercy, bringing desperately needed supplies to rural hospitals in need.

TJ Kim can’t play lacrosse — COVID-19 took the sport away. And at age 16, he can’t drive alone.But Kim can fly. And he’s turned his flying lessons into missions of mercy, bringing desperately needed supplies to rural hospitals in need.Each week, he carries gloves, masks, gowns and other equipment to small hospitals. When he made his first delivery, on March 27 to a 25-bed hospital in Luray, he was taken aback by the reception.“They kind of conveyed to me that they were really forgotten about. Everyone was wanting to send donations to big city hospitals,” he said. “Every hospital is hurting for supplies, but it’s the rural hospitals that really feel forgotten.”Like high school students across the country, Kim was disheartened when school and activities were shut down to slow the spread of the coronavirus. In TJ’s case, the shutdown ended his lacrosse season before it ever really got started.Kim, 16, a sophomore at Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland, brainstormed with his family in McLean, Virginia, about ways to keep active, and to serve the community while he had the time. They settled on Operation SOS — Supplies Over Skies.The most recent flight carried 3,000 gloves, 1,000 head covers, 500 shoe covers, 50 non-surgical masks, 20 pairs of protective eyewear and 10 concentrated bottles of hand sanitizer to Winchester to help supply a hospital in nearby Woodstock.The goal, he said, is to make deliveries to all seven rural hospitals in Virginia defined as critical access hospitals. The flights will become progressively longer. If all goes according to plan, the final flight would take him to Clintwood in southwest Virginia.Kim’s flight instructor, Dave Powell, said he was blown away when his student first proposed the project, especially since he knew how disappointed TJ had been with the cancellation of lacrosse.“For TJ to be more concerned with the needs of others in his melancholy state just reiterated to me how amazing this young man is,” Powell said.Kim’s father, Thomas, has helped round up supplies — the hardest part of the operation, according to his son. It was Thomas who bought TJ a flying lesson for his 15th birthday. He fell in love with the sky.“After I landed, all I could think about was going back up,” said, TJ, who hopes to attend the Naval Academy and ultimately become a pilot.Indeed, his flying is farther along than his driving. His preference for flying over driving is clear.“It’s a lot more free,” he said. “When you’re driving, you have to be in your lane, watch your blind spot and everything.”Thomas Kim said he was glad to see his son channel his initial disappointment at losing his sports season into something positive — “something that combines serving the community and his love of flying.”“The stars really aligned here,” the father said.

The man can be seen on video assaulting one girl until a young man runs up and tells him to back off.

A Kentucky physician has been arrested and charged in connection with an altercation that occurred last week.Louisville Metro Police Department said Monday that it was investigating after a group of teenage girls shared a video of a man cursing, shoving them and forcing his hands around a girl's neck. The man accused has been identified as John Rademaker, a local physician. LMPD said Rademaker was arrested Tuesday and charged with strangulation and three counts of harassment with physical contact.The incident happened Friday around 8:30 p.m.One of the witnesses contacted sister station WLKY on Sunday, saying Rademaker and a woman angrily approached them near the Norton Commons Amphitheater. The victim said that the couple used explicit language to express their disapproval of the teenagers being out while COVID-19 social distancing guidelines are in place.WLKY obtained a clip from one of the people involved, showing the man assaulting one girl until a young man runs up and tells him to back off.A woman is also seen putting her hands on at least one of the girls. Officers with LMPD Eighth Division responded to the incident. Sgt. Lamont Washington, with LMPD, released a report Monday. It said that the victim suffered minor injuries.LMPD officials released this statement:"Obviously, we do not advise individuals concerned about social distancing to take matters into their own hands and confront people about it, especially in any physical way. We ask people who are concerned about large gatherings to call 311 or 911 to report their concerns." Viewers identified Rademaker in the video and supplied his employer. WLKY reached out for comment Monday. Baptist Health officials said Rademaker is with an anesthesia group that they contract with and he was put on administrative leave following the incident. That group released this statement Tuesday:"SIAC, a division of One Anesthesia PLLC is aware of the incident that occurred in Norton Commons with one of its physicians, who was not on official call or due to report to the hospital in any official capacity. With that said, the partners of SIAC, a division of One Anesthesia PLLC have decided to place the physician that appeared in the video on administrative leave as of April 5 pending further investigation. Our well wishes extend to all parties involved and we will continue to monitor this situation as new information develops."             PROSPECT, Ky.

On top of ventilators, face masks and health care workers, you can now add COBOL programmers to the list of what several states urgently need as they battle the coronavirus pandemic.

Video above: President Trump wants to open the economy with a big bang, but says it might be limitedOn top of ventilators, face masks and health care workers, you can now add COBOL programmers to the list of what several states urgently need as they battle the coronavirus pandemic. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy has put out a call for volunteers who know how to code the decades-old computer programming language called COBOL because many of the state's systems still run on older mainframes.In Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly said the state's Departments of Labor was in the process of modernizing from COBOL but then the virus interfered. "So they're operating on really old stuff," she said. Connecticut has also admitted that it's struggling to process the large volume of unemployment claims with its "40-year-old system comprised of a COBOL mainframe and four other separate systems." The state is working to develop a new benefits system with Maine, Rhode Island, Mississippi and Oklahoma. But the system won't be finished before next year."Literally, we have systems that are 40-plus-years-old," New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said over the weekend. "There'll be lots of postmortems and one of them on our list will be how did we get here where we literally needed COBOL programmers?"Coders have moved away from the aging languageCOBOL, which stands for Common Business Oriented Language, is a computer programming language that was developed back in 1959, according to the National Museum of American History. "It's a programming language that was used to create a very significant percentage of business systems over the period of the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s," Joseph Steinberg, an expert on cybersecurity, told CNN.But over time, coders have moved away from the aging language."The general population of COBOL programmers is generally much older than the average age of a coder," Steinberg said. "Many American universities have not taught COBOL in their computer science programs since the 1980s."Yet, the program persists in systemsDespite a dwindling number of COBOL programmers, a 2017 report by Reuters found that there are still 220 billion lines of COBOL in use today. 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL and 95% percent of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code.Even in the federal government, COBOL is being used in agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Justice and Social Security Administration, according to a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office. A 2018 report by the inspector general for the Social Security Administration found that the administration maintained more than "60 million lines of COBOL" with "millions more lines of other legacy programming languages." The inspector general urged the administration to modernize its systems.With more than 44,000 COVID-19 cases in New Jersey, the last thing the governor should have to worry about are computer systems, Steinberg, the cybersecurity expert, said."Governors should not have to think about computer systems during a pandemic," he said,  "and we should have systems that if there are emergency situations, should not make the emergencies worse."

Students write letters thanking truckers for their hard work

“I was astounded at the love and compassion they showed, and I shouldn’t be, that is just the kind of kids they are."

As truck drivers all over the country spend hours on the road making deliveries to grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals and other essential businesses, a Mississippi middle school teacher wanted to do something to show support.“In the middle of the night, I had this idea to have my English class write them letters,” said Hartfield Academy teacher Linda Waterloo.She said the idea came easily because it was one close to her heart. “My son actually has Capital City Trucking Co., and was telling me how discouraged the drivers are,” Waterloo said. Waterloo’s seventh-grade class got to work on their handwritten thank you letters.“I was astounded at the love and compassion they showed, and I shouldn’t be, that is just the kind of kids they are,” Waterloo said.Judson Cavanaugh, the director of operations at Capitol City Trucking, said the drivers have loved reading the letters.  “They are so grateful and just thankful that someone is thinking of them,” Cavanaugh said.Cavanaugh said the trucking company is busier than ever before and the drivers deserve the recognition.“They are, day in and day out, putting themselves in harm's way. They are away from their families and getting us food. If you buy something refrigerated, a driver hauled it,” Cavanaugh said. The letters from the Hartfield Academy class are on display in the foyer of the trucking company for all the drivers to see.              RANKIN COUNTY, Miss.

Study: Coronavirus symptoms usually take 5 days to appear
.W
People infected by the novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure, and almost always within two weeks, according to a study released Monday.

People infected by the novel coronavirus tend to develop symptoms about five days after exposure, and almost always within two weeks, according to a study released Monday.That incubation period is consistent with previous estimates from public health officials, and the findings suggest that 14 days of quarantine are appropriate for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has used that standard during the current pandemic -- recommending, for example, that people self-quarantine for two weeks after traveling to countries with widespread coronavirus transmission, such as Italy or South Korea.When it comes to those quarantines, the incubation period "tells us how long it's reasonable to do that," said Justin Lessler, an author of the study and an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.His research, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, also suggests that symptomatic screening for the virus -- such as temperature checks at an airport -- may be missing recently infected people."If somebody is in their incubation period, that is the window when somebody who's already been infected can walk into the country and not be detected by symptom-based surveillance" said Lessler.That could explain why the CDC's efforts to screen more than 46,000 fliers for "fever, cough, and shortness of breath" have resulted in just one positive coronavirus case, according to the CDC's most recent screening data, which was released at the end of February.'A narrow window' to estimate the incubation periodTo estimate the incubation period, researchers scoured more than 180 reports of coronavirus in places without widespread transmission of the virus -- areas, in other words, where infection was likely due to outside travel.Because the study was conducted early in the coronavirus epidemic, community transmission at the time was limited to Wuhan, China. That allowed researchers to estimate the "time of exposure" to the coronavirus by determining when a person was in Wuhan -- the only plausible source of infection.By comparing travel to Wuhan with the emergence of symptoms, researchers could then estimate an incubation period for the virus: usually about five days, and rarely more than 12."We have sort of a narrow window at the beginning of the epidemic to really tease out what's going," said Lessler. "If it's everywhere, you don't know where people got infected."It's possible, the researchers said, that their study may have focused on more severe cases of the virus -- which are likelier to make the news and catch the attention of public health officials. The incubation for mild cases, then, might differ somewhat.Spreading disease without feeling illBill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he was "impressed by the way  have corralled such a range of data from so many sources to estimate something so important."Hanage, who was not involved with the research, said that "no study can fully nail down something like the incubation period at this point." But the researchers' estimate is "reasonable," he said, "and is also consistent with other independent estimates."The reported incubation period, however, relates to symptoms of the coronavirus, not infectiousness. It's possible, experts say, that people may be able to spread the virus before symptoms appear or without feeling ill at all.Both the CDC and the World Health Organization, for example, note that coronavirus infections can be asymptomatic, and the CDC says the role of presymptomatic transmission "is unknown."Hanage, the Harvard epidemiologist, said that those terms may be confusing, but "what matters is if a person can transmit before they are aware they might be infectious." And the answer, he said, "is an unambiguous yes."Whether that cryptic transmission occurs often enough to impact disease dynamics is another question, said Hanage, but "my opinion is that yes it does."The "period between reported infections" is short enough, he said, that some people are probably spreading the disease without feeling ill.'The goal is not necessarily zero cases'While the new study supports a 14-day monitoring period for some people, the researchers caution that quarantines aren't appropriate for everyone."The focus on containment has lasted a little bit too long," said Lessler, the study author. "We have to remember, particularly now that it seems like the virus is more widespread in parts of the United States and around the world, that the goal is not necessarily zero cases occurring after quarantine."Instead, he said, the focus needs to be on mitigation -- efforts that seek to reduce the virus' impact on communities once it's already spreading.The goal should be "to try to balance the risk of people spreading disease and infecting other who might be at high risk, and slowing the epidemic," said Lester."You just can't remove every health care worker who's been exposed to this virus from the population," he said.

Here's who is most likely to get coronavirus and how it compares to other diseases

The death rate for COVID-19, the new coronavirus that has taken hold in China, is lower and higher than other diseases. Here's what you need to know.

As infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout countries, understanding why one place fares better than another becomes critical to unravel.WHO’S MOST AT RISK FROM COVID-19?Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses, such as heart or lung diseases, are more at risk.Among younger people, deaths are rarer, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is connected to the World Health Organization. But some deaths among the young have made headlines, such as the 34-year-old doctor in China who was reprimanded by communist authorities for sounding an early alarm about the virus only to later succumb to it.In China, 80% of patients were mildly ill when the virus was first detected, compared with 13% who already were severely ill. While the sickest to start with are at highest risk of death, Aylward said, a fraction of the mildly ill do go on to die.On average, however, WHO says people with mild cases recover in about two weeks, while those who are sicker can take anywhere from three to six weeks.WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DEATH RATE?In the central China city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus first exploded, 2% to 4% of patients have died, according to WHO. But in the rest of hard-hit China, the death rate was strikingly lower, 0.7%.There’s nothing different about the virus from one place to another. Instead, the never-before-seen strain of coronavirus struck Wuhan fast — before anyone knew what the illness was — and overwhelmed health facilities. As is usual at the beginning of an outbreak, the first patients were severely ill before they sought care, Aylward said.By the time people were getting sick in other parts of China, authorities were better able to spot milder cases — meaning there were more known infections for each death counted.And while there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, earlier supportive care may help, too. China went from about 15 days between onset of symptoms and hospitalization early in the outbreak, to about three days later.Still, Aylward previously expressed frustration at people saying, “'Oh, the mortality rate’s not so bad because there’s way more mild cases.' Sorry, the same number of people that were dying, still die.”WHAT ABOUT DEATHS OUTSIDE OF CHINA?People who travel generally are healthier and thus may be better able to recover, noted Johns Hopkins University outbreak specialist Lauren Sauer. And countries began screening returning travelers, spotting infections far earlier in places where the medical system wasn’t already strained.Aylward cautioned that authorities should be careful of “artificially high” death rates early on: Some of those countries likely are seeing the sickest patients at first and missing milder cases, just like Wuhan did.HOW DOES COVID-19 COMPARE TO OTHER DISEASES?A cousin of this new virus caused the far deadlier severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, and about 10% of SARS patients died.Flu is a different virus family and some strains are deadlier than others. On average, the death rate from seasonal flu is about 0.1%, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.That's far lower than what has been calculated for COVID-19. But millions of people get the flu every year around the world, leading to an annual death toll in the hundreds of thousands. ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

President Donald Trump addressed the country Monday as a rattled Wall Street took a hit amid concerns of the coronavirus affecting the economy.During a White House meeting Monday, Trump addressed how the White House would be working on several efforts, including measures with Congress and the Small Business Administration, for ways to assist workers and companies.Trump said the White House is going to meet with members of Congress and discuss a possible payroll tax cut or relief. The president also said he was seeking help for hourly wage workers to ensure they’re “not going to miss a paycheck” and “don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault."The announcement came as Ireland canceled all its St. Patrick’s Day parades and Italy expanded a quarantine, originally placed on around 16 million people, to the entire country.Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. has already bought considerable time due to the measures it has taken.He also said the risk to contracting the virus remains low.The main thing is “we’re taking care of the American public,” and will be taking care of the American public, Trump said.Following a Sunday advisory by the U.S. State Department recommending people don’t go on cruise ships, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said healthy, young people should go on cruises. The concern, he noted, is for people with underlying conditions.

Thousands on virus-hit cruise ship await disembarkation
.W
The cruise ship forced to idle for days off the California coast because of a cluster of coronavirus cases aboard arrived in port Monday.

Thousands of passengers aboard a cruise ship struck by the novel coronavirus waited anxiously Monday for their chance to leave the vessel, even if meant being shipped to military bases for weeks of quarantine.After days of being forced to idle off the Northern California coast, the Grand Princess docked Monday at the Port of Oakland with some 3,500 passengers and crew on board.“Everyone was hollering and clapping” as the giant vessel sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge and entered the harbor, passenger Karen Schwartz Dever said.About two dozen people who need acute medical care were taken off the ship, although it wasn’t clear how many had tested positive for the new virus, COVID-19, said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services.Many of the nearly 240 Canadians on board left the ship after the critically ill and stood outside two tents displaying Canadian flags. Canada and the UK were among the countries sending chartered flights to retrieve their citizens.But some 2,000 passengers, including hundreds of Californians, were still aboard by the time disembarkation ended Monday night. It was to resume Tuesday morning, the captain told passengers.Carolyn Wright, 63, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, could look out of her cabin window as passengers lined up. Around them, she noted, were people in yellow protective clothing, gloves and even a few hazardous materials suits.For days, passengers aboard the ship had been isolated in their cabins. When they were finally allowed a few minutes on deck, she said, they were warned to wear masks and try to stay 6 feet away from each other.But after docking, video showed long lines forming for the processing tents. Ambulances were on hand to take some passengers away.“They were queuing up the passengers like cattle,” Wright said. “Everybody was bunched up. They were physically touching each other, and they were backed up along the gangplank.” Then, she said, they were taken away in chartered buses.“I’m just totally freaked out by that,” said Wright. “It’s outrageous. If that’s safe, then why were we stuck in our rooms? It’s been stressed for the past five days that we’re not to have any contact with any other passengers."“We’re trying to stay calm and were trying to stay positive but it’s getting harder and harder. They can’t make up their minds how to keep us safe,” said Wright’s cabin mate, Beryl Ward, 77, of Santa Fe.On Sunday, before the ship docked, Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had urged passengers to remain in their rooms and said: “We’re making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible.”He called the elaborate but quickly-planned disembarkation process a “really unprecedented and difficult operation.”The Grand Princess had been held off the coast since Wednesday because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for more than 20 infections tied to a previous voyage.U.S. passengers will be flown or bused from the port — chosen for its proximity to an airport and a military base — to bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and a 14-day quarantine. Some arrived Monday night at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California. The ship carried people from 54 countries, and foreigners were to be whisked home.But Wright and others said nobody had been told the details. Only about 50 people had been tested for the virus.“I’m willing to be quarantined,” Wright said. “’But I want to know if I’m positive or not. We don’t even know if we’re going to get tested. It’s all rumor and speculation.”“I’m bored and frustrated,” she added. “All of a sudden a two-week vacation has turned into a five-week vacation.” Passengers need to worry about who is looking after their children or pets, not to mention preparing their taxes before the deadline and earning a living. As a professional photographer, she was looking at five weeks without earning a salary.About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom have tested positive for COVID-19, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said.The California governor and Oakland mayor sought to reassure people that none of the cruise ship passengers would be exposed to the public before completing the quarantine. Officials were trying to decide where the ship and its crew would go next.Cruise ships have come under scrutiny by those who view them as potential germ factories because they pack thousands of people in close quarters.Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure.A third vessel, the Caribbean Princess, was supposed to dock in Grand Cayman on Monday but the cruise line said it will keep its thousands of passengers and crews from disembarking until crew members are tested for COVID-19.Around the world, nations have limited the movements of millions of people in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Italy was to impose travel restrictions and other strict public health measures nationwide starting Tuesday.In Northern California, Santa Clara County announced a ban of all large gatherings of at least 1,000 people for the rest of the month in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement Monday came hours after the public health department announced the county’s first coronavirus death, a woman in her 60s.The virus has shaken global markets, with stocks taking their worst one-day beating on Wall Street since 2008 and oil prices suffering their most brutal losses since the start of the 1991 Gulf War. Even with Asian markets posting modest gains Tuesday, fear was rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.The virus has infected 700 people in the United States, and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done after an outbreak in the Seattle area.The band Pearl Jam on Monday announced it was postponing 17 North American shows on its upcoming tour over coronavirus concerns.In Silicon Valley, NASA’s Ames Research Center is essentially closed with restricted access because an employee tested positive Sunday for the coronavirus. Workers will be on “mandatory telework status” and three earth science airplane missions are being delayed to later this year, the county said.Several universities have begun online-only courses, including the University of Washington, Stanford University and Columbia University.

Here's what employers need to know about putting together a coronavirus response plan.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has now issued guidance for workplaces preparing for the coronavirus. The document, developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, provides practical guidance for preventing the spread of COVID-19, such as safe work practices and appropriate protective equipment based on the risk level of exposure.   “Protecting the health and safety of America’s workforce is a key component of this Administration’s comprehensive approach to combating the coronavirus,” Loren Sweatt, principal deputy assistant secretary for Occupational Safety and Health wrote in a news release. “This guidance outlines practical ways that employers and workers can address potential health risks from the coronavirus in their workplaces.”The Department of Labor is encouraging employers to do the following: Develop infectious disease preparedness and response planStay up to date on guidance from federal, state and local health agencies and consider how to incorporate those recommendations into workplace-specific plans. Put necessary controls in place to address risks, including social distancing, staggered work shifts, downsizing operations, delivering services remotely and cross-training workers across different jobs in order to continue operations.Prepare to implement basic infection prevention measuresPromote frequent and thorough hand-washing and provide workers, customers and visitors a place to wash their hands. If soap and running water are not immediately available, provide alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60% alcohol.Encourage workers to stay home if they are sick. Encourage respiratory etiquette, including covering coughs and sneezes.  Discourage workers from using other workers’ phones, desks, offices or other work tools and equipment, when possible.Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including routine cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment, and other elements of the work environment. Develop policies and procedures for prompt identification and isolation of sick people if necessaryPromptly identify and isolate potentially infectious individuals to protect workers, customers and visitors. Inform and encourage employees to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of the coronavirus if they suspect possible exposure.Develop policies and procedures for employees to report when they are sick or experiencing symptoms of the virus. Develop, implement and communicate workplace flexibilities and protectionsActively encourage sick employees to stay home.Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies.Talk with companies that provide your business with contracts or temporary employees about the importance of sick employees staying home and encourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies.Do not require a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness or to return to work. Healthcare providers and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member.Be aware of  and address workers’ concerns about pay, leave, safety, health and other issues that may arise during infectious disease outbreaks.

Feds warn consumers about products claiming to be coronavirus remedies

"What we don't need ... are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims," Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons says.

Federal agencies are warning consumers not to fall for fraudulent products claiming they can counter the coronavirus.More than a half dozen companies have recently made such claims, according to U.S. officials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission issued letters to seven companies on Monday, warning them to stop advertising that their products are coronavirus treatments or cures. The products range from teas to essential oils and more.Businesses GuruNanda, Herbal Amy, N-Ergetics and Vital Silver told us they've now removed the questionable statements from their websites."There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus," Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. "What we don't need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims."One of the products was being touted by well-known televangelist Jim Bakker. The warning letter sent to Bakker's company cited the company's product silver sol liquid and said the company marketed the product as a possible "cure" for COVID-19.  The FDA noted that there are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat or prevent COVID-19. The agency said fraudulent products consumers should watch out for could also range from dietary supplements to other foods as well as products suggesting they're drugs, medical devices or vaccines.The full list of companies receiving the letter is below:•           Vital Silver (Melbourne, Florida)•           Quinessence Aromatherapy Ltd.

Dad of COVID-19 patient took child to a school function, prompting responses to avoid potential spread

The family had been told numerous times that self-quarantine is necessary as health officials continue to investigate the woman's case.

The 20-something college student didn’t know she had the new coronavirus as she flew home from a study abroad program in Italy, landing at one of the nation’s busiest airports. She took a train to a St. Louis station shared by Amtrak and the Greyhound bus service. Her father, who was exposed to her but shows no signs of illness, went to a coffee shop and took another daughter to a father-daughter dance at a hotel and a house party.The risk that hundreds of people were potentially exposed to COVID-19 by just one family explains why it is generating so much fear that schools are being closed, athletes are participating in sporting events in empty arenas, and the stock market has bottomed out.For most, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and a cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover.According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness get better in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.The young woman, an Indiana University student from St. Louis County who didn't know she was infected, returned home from a study abroad program in Italy, which has been hit hard by the virus. The plane landed at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago on March 2.More than 230,000 travelers pass through O’Hare daily. In January, the Chicago Department of Aviation installed new dispensers for hand sanitizers at O’Hare in high traffic areas, including food courts. The airport now has more than 300 in its four terminals. It also increased workers’ surface cleaning.After staying with a friend, she took an Amtrak train to St. Louis on Wednesday, departing at a hub called the Gateway Transportation Center in downtown St. Louis. A city spokesman said it’s unclear how many people she would have come in contact with at the station, but another Amtrak train would have passed through at roughly the same time, and the hub also serves Greyhound bus passengers.Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said about 169 customers who purchased tickets for the same train — Amtrak 303 — that the woman rode have been contacted to let them know of the patient’s test result.“They were encouraged to monitor their health and contact their health provider if they had questions,” he said.Amtrak canceled one round-trip on the Chicago to St. Louis route on Sunday. The train had returned to normal service by Monday. The train stations in Chicago and St. Louis also are being cleaned.St. Louis County spokesman Doug Moore said the young woman contacted the St. Louis County Health Department on Thursday to say she was feeling ill. She apparently stayed home and avoided contact with anyone until she was instructed to go to Mercy Hospital for testing on Friday. Meanwhile, County Executive Sam Page said, her family was told to self-quarantine at their home in Ladue.Health officials learned Saturday that the woman tested positive.Still, officials said, things got worse when they learned that the woman's father apparently failed to heed the self-quarantine warning, going to a coffee shop on his own and to a house party and a school dance with another daughter."The way the family has reacted to this situation is really a tale of two reactions and the tale of how people should and should not react to the coronavirus," Page said.County officials said the father and the younger daughter on Saturday night attended a father-daughter dance for students at Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School, private Catholic schools that share a campus with a combined 431 students. It's unclear how many people attended but it would have included students, parents, staff and workers.The dance was at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Clayton. A statement from the hotel said it is “taking additional steps to perform enhanced cleaning of hotel areas where the event was hosted."An online message from Villa, an all-girls school for seventh- to 12th-graders, and Oak Hill, which serves coed preschoolers through sixth-graders, advises students and parents who attended the dance to be attentive to symptoms. Both schools will remain closed this week and through next week’s spring break.The father and daughter also went to a pre-dance party at the home of a family whose children attend Villa as well as another private school, John Burroughs. Andy Abbott, the head of John Burroughs, said in a note to parents that a “handful” of Burroughs seniors went to the home after the father and daughter left. Although the students had no direct exposure, they won't be allowed to return to school for two weeks, a period that includes spring break.County and state health officials have not released details of other places the family members have visited, but workers at Deer Creek Coffee in Ladue called health officials and started cleaning after the family called to say that the father had been there Saturday morning while he was supposed to be quarantined.“Disinfectant and bleach, a thorough cleaning,” Brent McCarty, owner of Deer Creek Coffee, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “There is no cleaner surface right now than at Deer Creek Coffee. I can promise you that.”Meanwhile, St. Louis County health officials are still determining who else needs to be notified, checked for symptoms or tested.___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

How March Madness is planning to combat the spread of coronavirus
.W
With the big tournament just a week from tip-off, the NCAA has prepared for several scenarios to keep the disease from spreading.

March for college basketball fans means a month full of roaring crowds, dramatic upsets, buzzer beaters, blood, sweat and tears. But in the shadow of the novel coronavirus outbreak, there could be a new meaning to the phrase "March Madness."With the big tournament just a week from tip-off, the National College Athletic Association has prepared for several scenarios to keep the disease from spreading.In a game where around 20,000 players, coaches and fans will be hyping each other up with handshakes and hi-fives -- a precaution the Center for Disease Control says to avoid for people who are at a higher risk of getting sick -- that's not easy.One of them could mean empty seats. But can the NCAA play a game without fans?It's certainly prepared for it."Let's say that we discover that COVID-19 is an illness where the public health is really threatened," NCAA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brian Hainline told CNN. "The only people that are in the building are the players and the referees and the necessary personnel. The fans aren't there and we know that the risk mitigation is superb and that the people there are without risk of transmission ... We painted all of those scenarios, and so we're prepared for that."There were more than 9000 cases in the U.S. across 36 states and the District of Columbia with 29 deaths as of March 10. Vice President Mike Pence admitted the U.S. doesn't have enough coronavirus test kits to meet demand.Here's how the NCAA is planning for March Madness at a time of coronavirus.Planning aheadAhead of the tournament, the NCAA announced the creation of a coronavirus advisory panel on March 3. Dr. Hainline will lead a group of experts in public health and security, including the CDC, to evaluate the COVID-19 situation daily and prepare for every scenario accordingly.Members of the NCAA will work with host schools, conference offices and community partners to monitor the virus through the NCAA Sport Science Institute. And the internal team will meet twice a day, Dr. Hainline said."It's sort of like preparing for a hurricane and not knowing if it's going to fizzle out or be a category 5, but we have to be ready for every scenario," he said."The NCAA is committed to conducting its championships and events in a safe and responsible manner," NCAA chief operating officer Donald Remy said in a news release.In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the NCAA says "it continues to assess how COVID-19 impacts the conduct of our tournaments and events." A decision is expected within the coming days. Teams canceling games before the tournament startsColleges have already started to cancel games when playing in cities in the center of the worst coronavirus spread in the U.S., like Seattle.Chicago State University and the University of Missouri Kansas City, two Division I basketball programs, canceled their road trips to Seattle University on March 4."We respect Chicago State and Kansas City's decisions and understand their concerns. We share a commitment to ensuring the health and safety of our communities, fans and all who attend university-sponsored events," Seattle University said in a statement. "There has been no recommendation to suspend campus operations, including athletic contests, or restrict travel in the United States at this time."In the same state, the first and second round March Madness match-ups will be taking place in Spokane, Washington, from March 19 to March 21.Dr. Carlos Del Rio, Chair of the Hubert Department of Global Health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and member of the advisory panel, said the group will look at the data before making any final decisions to cancel games."We're obviously going to have to look at all the different options of what is the risk of infection, what is the risk of transmission, what is the risk of serious illness," Dr. Del Rio told CNN. "I don't think anybody wants to be a part of causing an outbreak."And that played a part in why Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, announced it hosted its NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament games without fans on March 5.Maryland declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus after three positive cases were confirmed in Montgomery County. The three Maryland patients contracted the coronavirus on a Nile River cruise in Egypt."Johns Hopkins University is pleased to be hosting the first two rounds of the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament this weekend," the university said in a statement. "However, in light of Maryland's recently confirmed cases of COVID-19, and based on CDC guidance for large gatherings, we have determined that it is prudent to hold this tournament without spectators."That same day, Stanford University announced it would limit the number of fans at its future sporting events in order to allow people to have social distancing.But what are the players saying ahead of the tournament?The National College Players Association has asked the NCAA to discuss having its tournament with no crowds in the arenas due to coronavirus fears."Precautions should include canceling all auxiliary events that put players in contact with crowds such as meet and greets and press events," the NCPA said in a statement on Feb. 29. "Athletic programs should also take every possible measure to sanitize buses and airplanes used to transport players."Health precautions during gamesIn a game where players share towels on the bench, Dr. Hainline says they put together a checklist to stop players from sharing items in the locker room and on the court.The checklist will also include an extra emphasis on having places where people can wash their hands in the arena and have the appropriate disinfectants, Dr. Hainline said.But the coronavirus isn't the only virus that they're paying attention to. The influenza epidemic is just as important."I'm still concerned about the ongoing flu," Dr. Del Rio said. "We need not to forget that."And during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, where an estimated 12,469 people died in the U.S. from April 2009 to April 2010, they created a similar task force. But this time, they're collaborating with a panel of experts that are in the medical and public health sector.And when it gets closer to tipoff, the NCAA's final decision is going to be decided by the health officials, not the NCAA."We have made it very clear that the decisions are going to be guided by, and we will not run counter to what our department of health and the health authorities are telling us," Hainline said. "And we also won't run counter to what our advisory panel is telling us."But one thing is certain, if the NCAA decided to host games without crowds, it would be losing out on a huge chunk of its billion dollar tournament.                        March for college basketball fans means a month full of roaring crowds, dramatic upsets, buzzer beaters, blood, sweat and tears.

"Athletic programs should also take every possible measure to sanitize buses and airplanes used to transport players."                                                                                                            Among numerous pro sports affected, MLB postpones opening day again due to coronavirus                          Health precautions during games In a game where players share towels on the bench, Dr. Hainline says they put together a checklist to stop players from sharing items in the locker room and on the court. The checklist will also include an extra emphasis on having places where people can wash their hands in the arena and have the appropriate disinfectants, Dr. Hainline said. But the coronavirus isn't the only virus that they're paying attention to. The influenza epidemic is just as important. "I'm still concerned about the ongoing flu," Dr. Del Rio said. "We need not to forget that." And during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, where an estimated 12,469 people died in the U.S. from April 2009 to April 2010, they created a similar task force. But this time, they're collaborating with a panel of experts that are in the medical and public health sector. And when it gets closer to tipoff, the NCAA's final decision is going to be decided by the health officials, not the NCAA. "We have made it very clear that the decisions are going to be guided by, and we will not run counter to what our department of health and the health authorities are telling us," Hainline said. "And we also won't run counter to what our advisory panel is telling us." But one thing is certain, if the NCAA decided to host games without crowds, it would be losing out on a huge chunk of its  billion dollar tournament.

"We stand united with you and we salute your courageous and compassionate efforts," first lady Melania Trump said.

The first lady released a brief video message Wednesday thanking medical professionals and others on the front lines of the response to the virus."It is because of you that the people of America are receiving the care and treatment they need," Melania Trump says in the video on behalf of herself and President Donald Trump. "We stand united with you and we salute your courageous and compassionate efforts. Our prayers are with all who are fighting this invisible enemy, COVID-19."The White House is also spreading some colorful Easter cheer to workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.With the annual White House Easter Egg Roll canceled due to concerns about large gatherings, the first lady is giving 25,000 commemorative wooden eggs to area children's hospitals, federal agencies, aid groups and grocery store chains.The pastel-colored eggs would have been handed out to participants in the egg roll on April 13, the day after Easter.The eggs are being delivered Wednesday and Thursday to Children’s National Hospital, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, the American Red Cross and local grocery store chains as a “small token of appreciation” for those serving the public, her office said.

“This is a catastrophe,” tomato grower Tony DiMare said.

Mounds of harvested zucchini and yellow squash ripened and then rotted in the hot Florida sun. Juicy tomatoes were left to wither — unpicked — in farmers' fields.Thousands of acres of fruits and vegetables grown in Florida are being plowed over or left to rot because farmers can’t sell to restaurants, theme parks or schools nationwide that have closed because of the coronavirus.Other states are having the same issues — agriculture officials say leafy greens in California are being hit especially hard, and dairy farmers in Vermont and Wisconsin say they have had to dump a surplus of milk intended for restaurants.With most of its harvests in the winter months, the problem is acute in Florida. For example, a few dozen people clamored to buy 25-pound (11- kilogram) boxes of Roma tomatoes direct from a packing plant over the weekend in Palmetto, a city on the western coast.The cost per box? Just $5.“This is a catastrophe,” said tomato grower Tony DiMare, who owns farms in south Florida and the Tampa Bay area. “We haven’t even started to calculate it. It’s going to be in the millions of dollars. Losses mount every day.”Florida leads the U.S. in harvesting tomatoes, green beans, cabbage and peppers this time of year. While some of the crops are meant for grocery stores, many farmers cater solely to the so-called food service market — restaurants, schools and theme parks — hit hard as cities and states have ordered people to stay home and avoid others.Video: Farmer shows row after row of green beans that were meant for the restaurant industryThe loss has created a domino effect through the farming industry, Florida’s second-largest economic driver. It yields $155 billion in revenue and supports about 2 million jobs.Many growers have donated produce to food banks, but there’s a limit on what the charities can accept and storage is an issue for perishable fruits and vegetables. DiMare said some central Florida food banks are full after theme parks shuttered and donated massive amounts of produce.“We gave 400,000 pounds of tomatoes to our local food banks,” DiMare said. “A million more pounds will have to be donated if we can get the food banks to take it.”Farmers are scrambling to sell to grocery stores, but it's not easy. Large chains already have contracts with farmers who grow for retail — many from outside the U.S.“We can’t even give our product away, and we're allowing imports to come in here,” DiMare said.He said 80 percent of the tomatoes grown in Florida are meant for now-shuttered restaurants and theme parks.In the past week, 20 federal lawmakers from Florida and state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried sent letters urging U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to include Florida farmers in federal food purchase and distribution programs so the surplus crops can help feed the hungry and food insecure. Some 37 million Americans struggled with hunger before the pandemic, according to Feeding America, a nationwide network food banks.The federal coronavirus relief act contains $9.5 billion in aid to farmers.Some farmers have tried to branch out and sell produce boxes directly to customers, an approach taken in many places as the pandemic slams the restaurant and catering industries worldwide.Wholesalers in London who usually sell fruit and vegetables to restaurants have pivoted to home deliveries. But large-scale farmers know selling harvest baskets won’t do much for their bottom line.On the U.S. West Coast, farmers who grow lettuce and other leafy greens are feeling the pinch.“The tail end of the winter vegetable season in Yuma, Arizona, was devastating for farmers who rely on food service buyers,” said Cory Lunde, spokesman for Western Growers, a group representing family farmers in California, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. “And now, as the production shifts back to Salinas, California, there are many farmers who have crops in the ground that will be left unharvested," particularly leafy greens.He said a spike in demand for produce at the beginning of the outbreak has now subsided.“People are staying home and not visiting the grocery stores as often," Lunde said. “So the dominoes are continuing to fall.”In southern Florida, Paul Allen, president of R.C. Hatton Farms, took a video last week of row after row of vibrant green beans that were scheduled to be shipped to the restaurant industry.“You can see this is a huge field of green beans,” he said, lifting his cellphone camera to show a tractor plowing all the healthy plants and their beans into the soil.Allen, who farms about 12,000 acres (4,900 hectares) in Florida and Georgia, is praying that things improve by the time crops in north Florida and Georgia are ready to be harvested over the next two months.“You just hope you can live another day,” Allen said.___Associated Press writer Amy Taxin contributed to this report from Orange County, California.

Justice is delayed: Virus crisis upends courts system across US
.W
“Everybody is scrambling. Nobody really knows how to handle this,” said Claudia Lagos, a criminal defense attorney in Boston.

Courthouses shuttered. Thousands of trials on hold. Legal deadlines pushed. The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the U.S. legal system, creating constitutional dilemmas as the accused miss their days in court. The public health crisis could build a legal backlog that overwhelms courts across the country, leaving some defendants behind bars longer, and forcing prosecutors to decide which cases to pursue and which to let slide. “Everybody is scrambling. Nobody really knows how to handle this,” said Claudia Lagos, a criminal defense attorney in Boston.Judges from California to Maine have postponed trials and nearly all in-person hearings to keep crowds from packing courthouses. Trials that were underway — like the high-profile case against multimillionaire real estate heir Robert Durst — have been halted. Some chief judges have suspended grand juries, rendering new indictments impossible. Other have allowed them to sit, though 6 feet apart. Prosecutors may have to abandon some low-level cases to keep people from flooding into the legal system.Many judges are holding hearings by phone or video chat to keep all cases from grinding to a halt. Other courts are stymied by outdated technology. The clerk for the the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Molly Dwyer, likened the logistical challenges to “building the bike as we ride it.” Judges have asked for emergency powers to delay trials longer than the law generally allows and extend key deadlines, like when a defendant must initially appear in court. That could keep people locked up longer, exposing them to unsafe jail conditions, and violate their constitutional right to a speedy trial, defense lawyers say.“We shouldn’t be creating mechanisms in the current crisis to keep people in jail longer. The jails are just tinderboxes waiting for the virus to take off,” said Jeff Chorney, deputy public defender in Alameda County, California. Courts there now have seven days instead of 48 hours to hold arraignments, during which a defendant is often appointed a lawyer and can enter a plea. The pandemic has shuttered nearly every aspect of everyday life as the death toll mounts and more states impose strict stay-at-home orders. There are nearly 400,000 cases and more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.Still, coast-to-coast disruptions of the courts system are unprecedented. In 2004, Hurricane Katrina forced courts in New Orleans to temporarily close. The suspension of legal deadlines after the natural disaster left thousands languishing behind bars for months without formal charges, attorneys say. Lawyers there fear a repeat.“On a regular day, without a crisis like Katrina and COVID, you can imagine people getting lost in a system like this,” said Alanah Odoms Hebert, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “There will be a lot folks who fall through the cracks.” No civil litigation is getting done. U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger in Chicago chafed at a recent request for an emergency order barring the alleged misuse of elf and unicorn drawings. “The world," he said, "is facing a real emergency. (The) plaintiff is not.”The COVID-19 disruptions are causing widespread confusion with prosecutors and defense attorneys as they struggle to file documents, get matters heard in courthouses operating on skeleton crews and share information with jailed clients while maintaining social distancing. Lawyers for Elizabeth Holmes, head of the blood-testing startup Theranos, scheduled to be tried this summer for allegedly defrauding investors, asked a California federal judge to also exempt them from the orders. They said the restrictions made witness preparation and serving subpoenas difficult. The judge refused.Attorneys are wary of visiting their clients in jails for fear of contracting the virus or spreading it behind bars. They rely on phone calls, which in some places are recorded, limiting what they can say. "You have to sort of chose between your safety and your client's safety ... or their constitutional rights. It’s a really impossible situation," said William Isenberg, a Boston defense attorney. The haphazard operations could lead defendants to later challenge convictions, even if their lawyers did the best they could during the virus-related tumult. Courthouse chaos may worsen when the shutdowns end, as judges try to return to old cases while fielding a burst in new cases. A flood of lawsuits linked to COVID-19 will add to the logjam. Related: Petition calls for prison inmates to get face masks, hand sanitizer “The courts are looking down the barrel of a real serious bottleneck,” said Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “I don’t think anybody has figured out what they’re going to do.”Crime victims are also forced to wait. In Minnesota, the virus has postponed the federal trial of an Illinois militia leader accused of being the ringleader in the 2017 pipe bombing of a Minnesota mosque. Michael Hari’s trial was already postponed once. Now it’s scheduled for late July.Mohamed Omar, executive director of the mosque, said community members want to see quick justice, but that he understands the need for a delay. “The safety of our community and those that are vulnerable are more important to us now more than any other thing,” he said. “This is bigger than all of us.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in a few weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.                        Courthouses shuttered. Thousands of trials on hold.

Countries start thinking about easing up on restrictions after coronavirus hits its peak

As the U.S. approaches its coronavirus peak, it and other countries begin considering the major question: "How do we go back to normal?"

Video above: Trump says aggressive measures slowing spread of virusEven as coronavirus deaths mount across Europe and New York, the U.S. and other countries are starting to contemplate an exit strategy and thinking about a staggered and carefully calibrated easing of the restrictions designed to curb the scourge.“To end the confinement, we’re not going to go from black to white; we’re going to go from black to gray,” top French epidemiologist Jean-François Delfraissy said in a radio interview.At the same time, politicians and health officials warn that the crisis is far from over despite signs of progress, and a catastrophic second wave could hit if countries let down their guard too soon. Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in places like Italy and Spain, and even New York has seen encouraging signs amid the gloom. “We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. "But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing.”In a sharp reminder of the danger, New York state on Wednesday recorded its highest one-day increase in deaths, 779, for an overall death toll of almost 6,300.“The bad news is actually terrible,” Cuomo lamented. Still, the governor said that hospitalizations are decreasing and that many of those now dying fell ill in the outbreak's earlier stages.In other developments:— Stocks shot 3.4% higher on Wall Street amid the encouraging signs about the outbreak’s trajectory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 780 points.— U.S. researchers opened another safety test of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, this one using a skin-deep shot instead of the usual deeper jab. A different vaccine candidate began safety testing in people last month in Seattle.— British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a second night in intensive care but was improving and sitting up in bed, authorities said.— Saudi Arabian officials announced that the Saudi-led coalition fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen will begin a cease-fire starting Thursday. They said the two-week truce was in response to U.N. calls to halt hostilities around the world amid the epidemic.In China, the lockdown of Wuhan, the industrial city of 11 million where the global pandemic began, was lifted after 76 days, allowing people to come and go.Wuhan residents will have to use a smartphone app showing that they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus. Schools remain closed, people are still checked for fever when they enter buildings and masks are strongly encouraged.In the U.S., with over 14,000 deaths and 400,000 infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was considering changing self-isolation guidelines to make it easier for those exposed to someone with the virus to return to work if they have no symptoms.Under the proposed guidance, aimed at workers in critical fields, such people would be allowed back on the job if they take their temperature twice a day and wear a mask, said a person who was familiar with the draft but was not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert, said that the Trump administration has been working on plans to eventually reopen the country amid “glimmers of hope” that social distancing is working to stop the virus’s spread.“That doesn’t mean we’re going to do it right now,” he said on Fox News. “But it means we need to be prepared to ease into that. And there’s a lot of activity going on.” Vice President Mike Pence warned that Philadelphia was emerging as a potential hot spot and urged its residents to heed social distancing guidelines. Pence said he spoke to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and said that Pittsburgh was also being monitored for a possible rise in cases.The U.S. is also seeing hot spots in such places as Washington, D.C., Louisiana, Chicago, Detroit and Colorado. The New York metropolitan area, which includes northern New Jersey, Long Island and lower Connecticut, accounts for about half of all virus deaths in the U.S.In Europe, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the country’s lockdown will remain in place amid expectations that some restrictions could be eased. Discussions are focused first on opening more of the country's industries.Proposals being floated in Italy include the issuing of immunity certificates, which would require antibody blood tests, and allowing younger workers to return first, as they are less vulnerable to the virus.Italy, the hardest-hit country, recorded its biggest one-day jump yet in people counted as recovered and had its smallest one-day increase in deaths in more than a month. Nearly 18,000 have died there.In Spain, which has tallied more than 14,000 dead, Budget Minister María Jesús Montero said Spaniards will progressively regain their “normal life” from April 26 onwards but warned that the “de-escalation” of the lockdown will be “very orderly to avoid a return to the contagion.”The government has been tight-lipped about what measures could be in place once the confinement is relaxed, stressing that they will be dictated by experts.Without giving specifics, French authorities have likewise begun to speak openly of planning the end of the country's confinement period, which is set to expire April 15 but will be extended, according to the president's office. The virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives in France. Earlier this week, Austria and the Czech Republic jumped out ahead of other European countries and announced plans to relax some restrictions. Starting Thursday, Czech stores selling construction materials, hobby supplies and bicycles will be allowed to reopen. Only grocery stores, pharmacies and garden stores are up and running. The reopened businesses will have to offer customers disinfectant and disposable gloves and enforce social distancing. Austria will begin reopening small shops, hardware stores and garden centers on Tuesday, and shopping malls and hair salons could follow two weeks later. People will have to wear face masks.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said authorities will watch carefully and will “pull the emergency brake” if the virus makes a comeback.British government officials, beset with a rising death toll of more than 7,000, said there is little chance the nationwide lockdown there will be eased when its current period ends next week. The desire to get back to normal is driven in part by the damage to world economies.The Bank of France said the French economy has entered recession, with an estimated 6% drop in the first quarter compared with the previous three months, while Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, is also facing a deep recession. Expert said its economy will shrink 4.2% this year. Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, could contract by a record 25% this quarter, the highest since gross domestic product began to be tracked in 1955.Worldwide, 1.5 million people have been confirmed infected and around 90,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are almost certainly much higher, because of limited testing, different rules for counting the dead and concealment by some governments. For most, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and death. Over 300,000 people have recovered.

President Trump says he will look into 'Tiger King' case
.W
During a White House coronavirus task force press briefing, President Donald Trump was asked about the "Tiger King" case, and said he would look into it.

During a White House coronavirus task force press briefing, President Donald Trump was asked about the "Tiger King" case, which is the subject of the "Tiger King" documentary on Netflix that has become a laser-focused point of pop culture discussion for a quarantined America.The central figure of the documentary, zoo-keeper Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic, is serving a 22-year prison sentence after being convicted of murder for hire. The hire was allegedly to murder animal rights activist Carole Baskin, whom he had a history of public feuds with, including repeatedly claiming she had murdered her missing husband. Maldonado-Passage and Baskin both claim they are innocent.When asked about a potential pardon, Trump said, "I don't know, I know nothing about it," before asking what the charges were."Do you think he didn't do it?" Trump asked. "Are you on his side? Are you recommending a pardon?" Trump then joked the reporter shouldn't do that, as they would be criticized by the other reporters."I'll take a look," Trump said before taking another question.

How sports leagues are responding to coronavirus and what fans are doing to get through it
.W
Here's everything you should know on where professional leagues in the U.S. stand on their coronavirus response, and when you can expect your teams to return.

One of the many facets of life put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic are, to the anguish of many fans, sports.Days of obsessing over beloved teams -- chatting about NBA playoff bets, lamenting about March Madness brackets or meticulously following the opening days of the MLB season -- have been cut.Just ask Benjamin Dennison.The 24-year-old grew up watching basketball; he follows March Madness every year and told CNN he watches a few NBA games a week. When the NBA suspended its season and March Madness was canceled, he was shocked. Still, he said the changes were "totally necessary."Getting that many people together would just be too dangerous right now, he said.To fill the void, Dennison said he watches classic NBA games that some channels have been airing. He's also gone on YouTube and watched highlights. It helps, he said.Pat Del Rosario, 28, got a little creative with his group of friends. Originally from the Bay Area, Del Rosario will sometimes stay up until 1 a.m. watching Golden State Warriors games from the East Coast. With the NBA on hold, he and some friends got together virtually and watched an old game together on YouTube, hitting play at the same time so they'd all be in sync."It kind of feels like we're hanging out and COVID isn't happening," the New York City resident told CNN. "It's like an outlet. It makes you feel normal."Though he's saddened that so many sports are now on hold, he agrees with Dennison -- the suspensions are necessary, he said.And most leagues probably won't be returning to normal anytime soon.For everyone in mourning, here's everything you should know on where professional leagues in the U.S. stand on their coronavirus response, and when you can expect your teams to return.MLBIn March, Major League Baseball canceled spring training and indefinitely delayed the start of the 2020 season, meant to begin on March 26.But as the coronavirus spread has yet to slow down, the league is now considering other options -- most notably playing the entire season in one location."While we have discussed the idea of staging games at one location as one potential option, we have not settled on that option or developed a detailed plan," the MLB said in a statement Tuesday.The league is considering "numerous contingency plans" for once the situation improves, the league said.Baseball could actually be back beginning as early as May, ESPN reported.Other reports say the league is looking to get all teams to play in Arizona, where half of MLB teams hold their spring training in the Phoenix area. The stadiums are all within about 50 miles from each other, allowing teams to quarantine in a hotel and not have to travel far for their games.The games, of course, would be played with no fans.Still, the MLB says it has yet to seek approval for any specific plan from government officials or the players association so far.NBA/WNBAAlmost a month ago, the NBA suspended its season after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for coronavirus. This week, commissioner Adam Silver said there would be no word on when basketball will be back until May -- at the earliest.What's a bored NBA fan to do?Well, for one, it seems like the players are just as antsy as the fans. Sixteen players -- including Trae Young, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine and Demarcus Cousins -- have been participating in an NBA 2K20 tournament, in which they battle each other in the basketball video game. So, it's not real ball, but maybe it'll fill the void in fans' hearts.If simulated basketball just won't do, the NBA has made League Pass free until April 22 for fans stuck at home. The service offers replays of games from the 2019-2020 season, as well as archived classic games.Still, many questions remain about the NBA's return, and it's not just about the start date. How will the regular season's timeline be affected? How will playoffs operate? These are questions Silver alluded to in an interview with TNT, but he said it is too early to make any projections.The WNBA, meanwhile, was meant to begin its season May 15, but it has since been postponed. New start dates have yet to be announced.NHLOn March 12, the National Hockey League suspended its regular season, which was originally scheduled to end on April 4, followed by the Stanley Cup playoffs, of course.Obviously, a wrench has been thrown into the regularly scheduled programming.The league, like many others, doesn't know much right now, though commissioner Gary Bettman said Tuesday officials hope to know more by the end of April. That means the fans could be watching hockey in the middle of summer.NASCARNASCAR has postponed all race events through May 3, but that doesn't mean there's no racing to be seen. It's just gone virtual.Many NASCAR drivers, including the likes of Dale Earnhardt Jr., have taken up iRacing -- where drivers race from the comfort of their home. The sport existed long before coronavirus, but has been getting extra attention because of the virus.Fox Sports has plans to air the rest of the iRacing season on their platforms, making the sport easily available for NASCAR fans to tune in.NFLThe actual National Football League's season may be a few months away, but the 2020 draft is still scheduled for April 23.How's that possible? The draft is going full virtual, with coaches and team personnel making picks from their individual homes, announced commissioner Roger Goodell in a memo.Meanwhile, league and club facilities will remain closed indefinitely. The NFL season is scheduled to kick off in September, but depending on the status of the epidemic, that could change.TennisBoth men's and women's professional tennis -- the ATP and WTA tour -- have suspended their seasons until June 7, freezing the rankings in the process.That means that the French Open, or Roland Garros, which typically begins in May, has been moved to instead begin on Sept. 20.Wimbledon, however, has been completely canceled. It had been scheduled to begin on June 29.That being said, it's a difficult time for tennis fans everywhere. With players stuck at home, some have taken to social media to provide some content for those feeling tennis-deprived.Venus Williams, for example, teamed up with Grigor Dimitrov to host a workout session on Instagram Live. It might not make up for Wimbledon, but it's something.                        One of the many facets of life put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic are, to the anguish of many fans, sports.

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard launched a virtual camp for kids. Now they are hiring camp counselors
.W
From story time to crafting lessons to singalongs, Camp Hello Bello — which is free — offers a variety of activities during the week.

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's brand, Hello Bello, is looking to hire camp counselors for their newly launched virtual kids camp.Hello Bello is the couple's family brand that sells baby products such as diapers, vitamins and lotions.

Can you really lose your sense of smell from coronavirus? We asked an expert.

Is it true that a tell-tale symptom of being infected with the coronavirus, is that you lose your sense of smell? And even if that's true, should losing your sense of smell be a cause for alarm?

To get into the U.S. Army Garrison Daegu in South Korea, you must pass a new test: Be able to smell. That's because some reporting points to loss of smell as a potential symptom of COVID-19.Is it true that a tell-tale symptom of being infected with the coronavirus, is that you lose your sense of smell? And even if that's true, should losing your sense of smell be a cause for alarm?Mark Albert spoke with Dr. Dana Hawkinson of the University of Kansas Health System to get a better sense if loss of smell is a symptom of coronavirus. "Tell us, if you would, about that particular symptom," Albert asked. "And do you think that kind of a test should be rolled out more frequently?""Certainly we've heard of fever, cough, shortness of breath, body aches," Hawkinson said. "There are other secondary symptoms which seem to occur, but less commonly, such as anosmia or the inability to smell, inability to taste fully, and even other GI symptoms such as diarrhea. You know, we don't know the proportion of people that have that."While Hawkinson acknowledges there are anecdotes of such symptoms, and that it could be stepping stone to a diagnosis, it's nothing to solely base a a determination on."Be aware that there are other symptoms and there is a wide range of clinical presentations for this disease that we just don't know. And hopefully as we get further into this, we get more data about the virus. We get more data about the clinical presentation and we'll be able to make more informed decisions based on that. But I don't think that's unreasonable to use it as a screening and then maybe ask and delve deeper in there."The director of the University of Florida Center for Smell and Taste, Dr. Steven Munger, said that while more analysis and study needs to be done, if you suddenly feel like you can't smell or taste, "The prudent thing to do is self-isolate and immediately call your physician."He advises to treat the symptom like a sign of infection until you know otherwise.

Fact Check: Politicians on both sides make misleading claims about coronavirus testing
.W
In the wake of an increasing number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S., federal officials have provided confusing and sometimes contradictory statements about the number and availability of tests to diagnose the illness.

Posted on March 10, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.In the wake of an increasing number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S., federal officials have provided confusing and sometimes contradictory statements about the number and availability of tests to diagnose the new respiratory illness.President Donald Trump claimed on March 6 that anyone who “wants a test can get a test,” while Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there “is no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.”Contrary to both men, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories on March 9 that although things had improved since a week ago, “demand for testing is greater than the tests available.”At the same time, at least one Democrat has exaggerated the problems.Former Vice President Joe Biden said on March 1 that the Trump administration didn’t “even have a test kit” for the new coronavirus. That’s not true. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely viewed to have bungled the rollout of its viral test kits, there was a test kit at the time, and it had been successfully used by the agency and some states.The novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the pneumonia-like illness called COVID-19, which first appeared in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.We’ll explain how testing works, what happened with the CDC’s coronavirus test and what’s known about how many tests are available in the U.S.How does a coronavirus test work?Most of the available diagnostics are molecular tests that use a standard molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.The test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample — such as a nose or throat swab, or some phlegm — and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. The scanning happens with test components known as primers and probes, which are sequence-based, and therefore can be made specific to the virus. In those reactions, if the novel coronavirus is present in the sample, then a short snippet of DNA is copied many times over, which can be read out on a machine. If there is no virus — or if there’s a different virus, such as influenza — then no DNA fragment is made and there’s no signal to detect.The CDC’s test was designed to use three main sets of primers and probes — two that match just the novel coronavirus, and one that matches a variety of highly similar viruses. Someone infected with COVID-19 should test positive for all three, while someone who’s not infected should be negative for all three. A person who has SARS would only test positive using the third primer and probe set, thereby offering a way to theoretically discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other similar viruses. That concern, however, is hypothetical in this case, since there isn’t a known outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.Eventually, the CDC will have a different so-called serology test that looks for whether a person developed antibodies in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The test, which does not need to be done when someone is actively infected, can yield a positive result whether or not someone developed symptoms. It therefore may provide answers about how many COVID-19 infections there were and how deadly the virus is in the larger population.What went wrong with the CDC’s test kits?Early on, all COVID-19 testing was done at the CDC with its own kit, and it performed well. The kit was successfully used to diagnose the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. on Jan. 20 in a patient returning from Wuhan to Washington state. A CDC report also notes that between Jan. 18 and Feb. 23, the agency tested 2,620 specimens from just over 1,000 people.Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. Initially, the agency said it was releasing 200 kits — each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens — giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had been experiencing issues when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.The CDC has not clarified exactly what the issue was, but has said that there was a manufacturing problem related to the third test component, which led to “inconclusive” results. The Association of Public Health Laboratories told us more specifically that a negative control, which should not have reacted to any of the primer and probe sets, was coming back positive for the third set, which was the test for all SARS-like coronaviruses.For a while, the agency promised to re-manufacture the faulty third component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix — labs could proceed without the third test, and just use the two other primer and probe sets to make accurate diagnoses. The agency also said that it had manufactured new tests with just the two components, omitting the third.What other factors limited testing?Other than the lack of CDC test kits, several other circumstances prevented wider scale testing early in the outbreak.One was the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested for the virus. At first, the CDC recommended testing only for those who had a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and had traveled to Wuhan or had contact with a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case.In late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC guidelines were relaxed to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Then, on March 3, Vice President Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test.The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians “should use their judgment” in deciding who should be tested, keeping in mind the local epidemiology and COVID-19 symptoms — and strongly encouraging testing for other respiratory infections, such as influenza.Another issue had to do with who could do COVID-19 testing.Academic labs and other similar facilities that had the expertise to develop tests were advised not to use their own tests for diagnosing patients until they sought permission from the Food and Drug Administration. As we’ve explained before, this is not a law but has been a de facto FDA policy. On Feb. 29, the FDA announced that validated in-house tests could be used for diagnosis immediately, as long as the agency received applications for the emergency use of the tests within 15 business days.How problematic was the delay?It’s not yet clear exactly what the delays meant for the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But some experts say the lack of testing in many of the nation’s public health labs hampered early detection. The CDC reported the first case of possible community spread on Feb. 26, and the first reported death, in a Seattle suburb, followed three days later. It would later turn out that two COVID-19-related deaths happened as early as Feb. 26. A genetic analysis of some of the first cases in Washington state also suggested that the virus had been circulating undetected since mid-January. The state did not begin its own testing until Feb. 28.Scott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health, told the Seattle Times that problems with the CDC’s test kit “really did set us back, there’s no denying that.”In a CDC telebriefing announcing the first U.S. death, Jeffrey Duchin, a University of Washington epidemiologist and health officer for Public Health Seattle and King County, noted that the patient who died had been tested locally, but only because the lab had just received kits and because of “very recent” changes in CDC criteria for testing. “If we had the ability to test earlier,” he said, “I’m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community.”With more available tests and less stringent clinical criteria for testing, the U.S. could have set up a more proactive system for detecting coronavirus cases, although it’s possible the outcome would still be the same. The CDC, in fact, wanted to set up a five- or six-site surveillance network in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, which would begin testing for COVID-19 in people with flu-like symptoms who test negative for influenza. The plan was to then scale up the network to each state. But with the test kit difficulties, that schedule was set back. On Feb. 28, the CDC said that it expected to have the first of six sites up and running by the following week. When we asked on March 10, the agency did not have an immediate update on the program.How many tests are available?Throughout last week, officials gave confusing and conflicting answers about how many tests would be available — and when — in various appearances.Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar said on March 1 that “we now have the ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment,” but later said that those tests would be shipped by the end of the week.Vice President Mike Pence also at times referred to test kits, when he meant the number of people who could be tested, and said on March 4, “We’ll have over a million tests in the field today,” a statement that conflicted with other administration estimates of 1 million tests shipping out by the end of the week.Part of the confusion has to do with the fact that testing is happening at several different levels — by the CDC, by state and local public health labs, and at hospitals and other facilities — and that the words used to describe the testing aren’t always consistent.A test “kit” means an entire box of supplies to run tests to diagnose many people. A CDC test kit, for example, is able to test 700 to 800 specimens. Other test kits come with enough reagents for 500 “reactions.” Because controls need to be run, fewer than 500 samples can be tested with such a kit. And in both cases, the actual number of people who could be diagnosed with each will be lower, since patients may have multiple samples or samples may be run in duplicate. The same issue applies to the word “test.”FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn provided the clearest answer about testing capacity on March 7, when he said that the CDC had shipped enough kits to state and local public health labs to test 75,000 people for COVID-19. In addition, more than 1.1 million tests manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies had been shipped as of March 6 for non-public health labs to use, with another 400,000 possibly shipping by March 9. A separate manufacturer had also produced 640,000 tests that could have shipped as early as March 9, once quality control testing was complete.“The actual number of tests that have shipped is larger than the number of patients that can be tested,” Hahn explained, noting that the approximately 2.1 million tests from IDT and another company would allow roughly 850,000 Americans to be tested.On top of those tests, he added, would be any testing by commercial or academic labs, plus an expected additional 4 million tests from IDT and the other company by the end of this week. The CDC itself also can test approximately 350 specimens per day.In a March 9 telebriefing, the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier clarified that the 75,000 people that can be tested using the CDC’s test kit in public health labs is a cumulative figure. She also said that in the coming weeks, as more manufacturers join the effort, the “majority” of testing will be from the commercial sector.Several commercial companies have stepped forward to increase production. Quest Diagnostics said it could begin testing on March 9, and LabCorp said its test was available for ordering on March 5, with results taking three to four days once a specimen is received in the mail. Can “anybody that wants a test” get one, as the president said?Not quite. On a March 6 visit to the CDC, Trump said, “Anybody that wants a test can get a test,” adding, “Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.”When we asked the White House about this, the vice president’s office told us that tests were available through state labs, but that doctors needed to contact the state lab to get one. In other words, if someone wants a test, and a physician does not agree, a person cannot be tested.This point was also made by Anthony Fauci, the director of the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on “Fox News Sunday,” when he said tests “are out there now,” but “it’s up to the doctor to order the test.”It’s worth mentioning that even if a test has been shipped, it hasn’t necessarily been received or is ready to use right away; tests also take some time to complete, and so results may not be available immediately.The CDC maintains that no person was ever denied a coronavirus test, nor was there ever a backlog at the agency. “Our guidance for who can be tested has always allowed room for clinical discretion,” said CDC press officer Richard Quartarone in an email. “That is, if a doctor had a patient who they wanted tested, CDC has not refused any of these requests.” The only exception to that, Quartarone told us, might be a damaged sample.Some groups, however, dispute the idea that tests are fully available or that there has never been a shortage.“We are now in the phase of the response where demand for testing is greater than the tests available, even when the private/commercial sector is doing testing,” Eric Blank, the chief program officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told us in a March 9 email. “So there is a test shortage but it is probably not as great as it was a week or so ago.”                        Posted on March 10, 2020                                                                                                  FactCheck.org                                                    Advertisement                       W e are collaborating with  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.

As a result, as of  Feb. 25 , only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing. More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC  said  it had come up with a fix — labs could proceed without the third test, and just use the two other primer and probe sets to make accurate diagnoses. The agency also said that it had manufactured new tests with just the two components, omitting the third. What other factors limited testing? Other than the lack of CDC test kits, several other circumstances prevented wider scale testing early in the outbreak. One was the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested for the virus. At  first , the CDC recommended testing only for those who had a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and had traveled to Wuhan or had contact with a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case. In late February,  after  a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC guidelines were relaxed to  include  anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Then, on  March 3 , Vice President Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. The CDC  updated  its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians “should use their judgment” in deciding who should be tested, keeping in mind the local epidemiology and COVID-19 symptoms — and strongly encouraging testing for other respiratory infections, such as influenza. Another issue had to do with who could do COVID-19 testing. Academic labs and other similar facilities that had the expertise to develop tests were advised not to use their own tests for diagnosing patients until they sought permission from the Food and Drug Administration. As we’ve explained  before , this is not a law but has been a de facto FDA policy. On Feb. 29, the FDA  announced  that validated in-house tests could be used for diagnosis immediately, as long as the agency received applications for the emergency use of the tests within 15 business days. How problematic was the delay? It’s not yet clear exactly what the delays meant for the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But some experts say the lack of testing in many of the nation’s public health labs hampered early detection.  The CDC reported the first case of possible community spread on  Feb. 26 , and the  first reported  death, in a Seattle suburb, followed three days later. It would  later turn out  that two COVID-19-related deaths happened as early as Feb. 26. A  genetic analysis  of some of the first cases in Washington state also suggested that the virus had been circulating undetected since mid-January. The state did not begin its own testing until  Feb. 28 . Scott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health,  told  the  Seattle Times  that problems with the CDC’s test kit “really did set us back, there’s no denying that.” In a CDC  telebriefing  announcing the first U.S. death,  Jeffrey Duchin , a University of Washington epidemiologist and health officer for Public Health Seattle and King County, noted that the patient who died had been tested locally, but only because the lab had just received kits and because of “very recent” changes in CDC criteria for testing. “If we had the ability to test earlier,” he said, “I’m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community.” With more available tests and less stringent clinical criteria for testing, the U.S. could have set up a more proactive system for detecting coronavirus cases, although it’s possible the outcome would still be the same.  The CDC, in fact,  wanted   to  set up a five- or six-site surveillance network in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, which would begin testing for COVID-19 in people with flu-like symptoms who test negative for influenza. The plan was to then scale up the network to each state. But with the test kit difficulties, that schedule was set back. On Feb. 28, the CDC  said  that it expected to have the first of six sites up and running by the following week. When we asked on March 10, the agency did not have an immediate update on the program. How many tests are available? Throughout last week, officials gave confusing and conflicting answers about how many tests would be available — and when — in various appearances. Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar said on  March 1  that “we now have the ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment,” but  later said  that those tests would be shipped by the end of the week. Vice President Mike Pence also at times referred to  test kits , when he meant the number of people who could be tested, and said on  March 4 , “We’ll have over a million tests in the field today,” a statement that conflicted with other administration estimates of 1 million tests shipping out by the end of the week. Part of the confusion has to do with the fact that testing is happening at several different levels — by the CDC, by state and local public health labs, and at hospitals and other facilities — and that the words used to describe the testing aren’t always consistent. A test “kit” means an entire box of supplies to run tests to diagnose many people. A  CDC test kit , for example, is able to test 700 to 800 specimens.  Other  test kits come with enough reagents for 500 “reactions.” Because controls need to be run, fewer than 500 samples can be tested with such a kit. And in both cases, the actual number of people who could be diagnosed with each will be lower, since patients may have multiple samples or samples may be run in duplicate. The same issue applies to the word “test.” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn provided the clearest answer about testing capacity on March 7, when he  said  that the CDC had shipped enough kits to state and local public health labs to test 75,000 people for COVID-19.  In addition, more than 1.1 million tests manufactured by  Integrated DNA Technologies  had been shipped as of March 6 for non-public health labs to use, with another 400,000 possibly shipping by March 9. A separate manufacturer had also produced 640,000 tests that could have shipped as early as March 9, once quality control testing was complete. “The actual number of tests that have shipped is larger than the number of patients that can be tested,” Hahn explained, noting that the approximately 2.1 million tests from IDT and another company would allow roughly 850,000 Americans to be tested. On top of those tests, he added, would be any testing by commercial or academic labs, plus an expected additional 4 million tests from IDT and the other company by the end of this week. The CDC itself also can  test  approximately 350 specimens per day. In a March 9  telebriefing , the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier clarified that the 75,000 people that can be tested using the CDC’s test kit in public health labs is a cumulative figure. She also said that in the coming weeks, as more manufacturers join the effort, the “majority” of testing will be from the commercial sector. Several commercial companies have stepped forward to increase production.  Quest Diagnostics  said it could begin testing on March 9, and  LabCorp  said its test was available for ordering on March 5, with results taking three to four days once a specimen is received in the mail.  Can “anybody that wants a test” get one, as the president said? Not quite. On a March 6  visit  to the CDC, Trump said, “Anybody that wants a test can get a test,” adding, “Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.” When we asked the White House about this, the vice president’s office told us that tests were available through state labs, but that doctors needed to contact the state lab to get one. In other words, if someone wants a test, and a physician does not agree, a person cannot be tested. This point was also made by  Anthony Fauci , the director of the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on “Fox News Sunday,” when he  said  tests “are out there now,” but “it’s up to the doctor to order the test.” It’s worth mentioning that even if a test has been shipped, it  hasn’t necessarily  been received or is ready to use right away; tests also take some time to complete, and so results may not be available immediately. The CDC maintains that no person was ever denied a coronavirus test, nor was there ever a backlog at the agency. “Our guidance for who can be tested has always allowed room for clinical discretion,” said CDC press officer Richard Quartarone in an email. “That is, if a doctor had a patient who they wanted tested, CDC has not refused any of these requests.” The only exception to that, Quartarone told us, might be a damaged sample. Some groups, however, dispute the idea that tests are fully available or that there has never been a shortage. “We are now in the phase of the response where demand for testing is greater than the tests available, even when the private/commercial sector is doing testing,” Eric Blank, the chief program officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told us in a March 9 email. “So there is a test shortage but it is probably not as great as it was a week or so ago.”

Inside 'social distancing': Italy's lockdown reshapes family life in time of coronavirus
.W
At first, she said her family scoffed at the reactive panic shopping.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's decision to lock down the entire country brought some welcome clarity to my family life after weeks of growing uncertainty about how to behave in a time of coronavirus.I live that stereotype of the multi-generational Italian family, next door to in-laws, both over 80 and suffering from a collection of non-debilitating ailments common for their age. I also live with two teenagers, one of whom in particular has chafed against any suggestion that his social life should be curtailed just when the virus has freed him from that age-old adolescent burden: school.So as I continued to commute to my job as an Associated Press correspondent based in Milan, the capital of Lombardy, from a small town in neighboring Veneto, the virus seemed both near and far.Near, because the two regions were quickly identified as hot spots with growing numbers of infections and two so-called red zones — but far, because no one we knew was sick, and many of the restrictions were still theoretical. They boiled down to frequent hand-washing.Virus fear escalated in mid-February as I covered Milan Fashion Week, shoulder-to-shoulder with fashion types from all over the globe, and where the closing show by Giorgio Armani was streamed without an audience as a precaution. But the closest cluster — not yet a red zone — was still an hour away.As the first restrictions took effect in Veneto and Lombardy — closing schools, museums, cinemas and bars after 6 p.m. — we scoffed at the reactive panic shopping.What were people doing with all that toilet paper? We had flour and pasta aplenty at home. And who needs a shopping cart full of bottled water? The taps weren't being turned off.The first day of the new measures was supposed to be the start of a three-day family break for Carnival in Nice, on the coast in neighboring France. But our sociable son woke up with a fever and stomach flu symptoms, and we decided it was better not to chance crossing the border as Italy became a focal point in coronavirus coverage.Normally we would have gone, stomach flu or not, and instructed the teen to sleep in the car, reasoning that the sea air would do him good.The painful decision to cancel seemed particularly wise after hearing reports of Italian cars being stopped in France for temperature checks. Imagine being found out transporting a feverish 16-year-old: the personal horror, the probable headlines. Back at work, I wrote about social distancing, about how Italians' habit of kissing could be part of the problem, before the 1-meter distancing rule started to gain currency. At home, we began a weeks-long struggle to impress upon invincible youth how vulnerable the elderly are to the virus.I compensated for our dashed holiday by taking my daughter spring clothes shopping in teen-focused stores where we no longer had to queue for dressing rooms.We ate out in empty restaurants. We had facials. We had to order ice cream at a table, not at the counter. It was the same when we wanted a quick refreshment after 6 p.m. — sit at a table, don't just stand at the bar.Cities were empty, parking places too easy to find, but we didn't feel particularly discouraged to be out. In fact, a hashtag began to circulate: #milanononsiferma, or #milandoesntstop. By being out, as long as we washed our hands frequently, we were doing our civic duty. Then virus cases skyrocketed, with Italy registering the most infections outside of China. My in-laws stopped going to the grocery store, instead ordering online. And they stopped kissing their grandchildren every morning and evening, as has been their habit.Finally, my children got remote homework assignments, and teachers started organizing video classes — even if the app sometimes failed. The notion of a holiday was over.Then this past weekend, we saw the red zone expand from two distant dots on the map — east and west — to provinces just 30 minutes each direction. A Sunday family dinner with my kids' four cousins, who are also going stir-crazy with no school — was canceled by the new travel ban out of Lombardy.Also scratched were my plans to hop over on a free day and see Venice in its newfound quiet after a hotel owner with zero rooms booked because of the virus described the glassy surface of the Grand Canal absent boats transporting Venetians and their wares.Finally, on Monday evening, the red ink of the restricted travel zone soaked through the entire map of Italy, which had become one big hot spot. The same day, the first confirmed case was announced on Facebook by the mayor of our town. Suddenly, the virus was just near. And Conte declared the new Italian motto: ''I stay at home.''When I told my son, standing at his Playstation, about the national lockdown until April 3, he looked dejected. "How many days is that? What am I going to do for a month?" But for the first time in three weeks, he accepted he couldn't go out that night.             SOAVE, Italy

A pandemic is described as a worldwide spread of disease, according to WHO.

Above video: What items to buy to prep for a self-quarantineThe World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.A pandemic is described as a worldwide spread of disease, according to WHO. The agency said it thought long and hard about using the label — meaning a new virus causing sustained outbreaks in multiple regions of the world.The declaration comes after more than  118,000 cases have been confirmed in 114 countries across the globe, and 4,291 people have lost their lives, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, said as the designation was announced.Tedros said the organization is concerned about the spread and severity of the virus.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

President Trump suspends travel from Europe to US for 30 days amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
President Donald Trump announced plans to suspend travel from Europe to the US, excluding the UK, for 30 days to combat the coronavirus outbreak.

Taking drastic action Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced he is cutting off travel from Europe to the U.S. for foreign nationals and moving to ease the economic cost of an epidemic that is roiling global financial markets and disrupting the daily lives of Americans.Trump made the announcement, during a rare Oval Office address to the nation, that he is suspending all travel from Europe to the U.S. for foreign nationals for 30 days beginning Friday at midnight. After days of playing down the threat, he blamed the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the novel coronavirus and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers. “We made a lifesaving move with early action on China," Trump said. "Now we must take the same action with Europe.”Trump originally stated travel from Europe to the U.S. would be banned for 30 days, but the Department of Homeland Security later clarified this only applied to foreign nationals.Trump said the restrictions won't apply to the United Kingdom, and there would be exemptions for “Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings." He said the U.S. would monitor the situation to determine if travel could be reopened earlier.The mounting effort to contain the virus and financial fallout intensified on a grueling day: Communities canceled public events nationwide, universities moved to cancel in-person classes, and families grappled with the impact of disruptions to public schools. The number of confirmed cases of the infection topped 1,000 in the U.S. and the World Health Organization declared the global crisis is now a pandemic.In a week of mixed messages and false starts, as government officials warned in increasingly urgent terms that the outbreak in the U.S. will only get worse, Washington suddenly seemed poised to act.Congress, for its part, unveiled a multibillion-dollar aid package Wednesday that was expected to be voted on by the House as soon as Thursday."I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said the virus is "10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.”Trump spoke after days of confusion in Washington amid mounting calls on the president to demonstrate greater leadership. In the hours leading up to his remarks, White House aides struggled to determine what action the president could take unilaterally and what required congressional action, as Trump personally weighed the public and political reactions to the options before him.Trump said he was also directing agencies to provide unspecified financial relief “for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus," and asked Congress to take action to extend it.Trump said the U.S. will defer tax payments for some individual and business filers for three months to lessen the impacts of the virus outbreak. He said the Small Business Administration will also make low-interest loans available to businesses to help them weather the storm."This is not a financial crisis," he said. "This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world."Trump also reiterated his call on Congress to pass a cut to the federal payroll tax in order to stimulate the economy, though that proposal was dismissed by many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He remained silent on his previous calls to provide assistance to industries hard-hit by the outbreak like airlines and cruise ships.On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled an economic assistance plan that was gaining bipartisan backing. Central to the package is free coronavirus testing nationwide and emergency funding to reimburse lost paychecks for those self-quarantining, missing work or losing jobs amid the outbreak.The draft legislation would create a new federal emergency sick leave benefit for people with the virus or caring for a coronavirus victim. It would provide two-thirds of an employee's monthly income for up to three months.Facing a likely surge in unemployment claims, the package would also give states money for the newly jobless. It would provide additional funding for food and nutrition benefits for pregnant women, mothers and young children. It also would up money for “meals on wheels” and food for low-income elderly people.“Right now we're trying to deal with the direct impact of the virus on individual citizens," said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whom Trump tapped to negotiate with Pelosi, urged Congress "to pass legislation quickly."“This is a little bit like a hurricane, and we need to cover these outside of normal expenses,” Mnuchin said.The administration had floated several other strategies, including the rare idea of declaring a national disaster that could potentially unlock funding streams, according to a person unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity. But Trump ultimately opted against taking that step Wednesday.A major disaster declaration provides additional authorities for federal agencies, including the military, to assist in responding to an emergency, including medical care, sheltering and distributing goods.The administration also rolled out new recommendations for the communities most impacted by the virus in Washington state, New York and California, while authorizing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to take whatever steps necessary to increase the supply of face masks available to doctors and nurses by providing them with masks intended for industrial use.Mnuchin noted that Trump's executive authorities are “quite significant" and said the administration would be rolling out “various proposals."As pressure mounted for Washington to respond, the GOP leader in the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, signaled potential Republican support for the funding package in Congress.“We need to do something," McCarthy said. "I think they could become very bipartisan.”Pelosi's goal is to pass an aid package before lawmakers leave town for a previously scheduled weeklong recess, and revisit potential stimulus measures later.___Associated Press writers Lauran Neergaard, Marty Crutsinger, Laurie Kellman and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.

From youth hockey to the NBA, here's how sports organizations want players to avoid coronavirus
.W
A major hockey organization tied to youth and recreational players recommends a guideline for opposing teams after games.

Sports groups are seeking to avoid a rapidly contagious virus by giving players a simple tip: fist-bumps.USA Hockey, which is linked to youth, adult and disability programming as well as the Olympic teams, has recommended a guideline to use fist bumps with hockey gloves on in handshake lines.It's a measure that mirrors an instruction given to hockey players in 2018 for Winter Olympics games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, due to the highly contagious norovirus.Some of the organization's other recommendations due to the virus include not sharing water bottles or towels.The International Ice Hockey Federation said this week it has canceled six different tournaments — events that were to take place in March and April in Estonia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain. Pro leagues in Switzerland and China have also been affected, some games called off, others played without fans.The NHL hasn’t gone as far as the NBA did earlier this week. The NHL is, however, not allowing its employees to make work-related trips outside of North America in response to the global fears over the coronavirus, and if any of those employees go on their own to a country where the virus has been found they will be quarantined before being able to return to work.Video: How coronavirus is spreadSan Francisco Mayor London Breed announced a ban on all events larger than 1,000 people across the city on Twitter. The ban will apply to all events at Chase Center, including Golden State Warriors games, the Chronicle reported.As a result of the ban on large gatherings, Thursday's game against the Brooklyn Nets will be played without fans, the Warriors confirmed in a statement. All paying fans will receive refunds.The NBA has told players to avoid high-fiving fans and strangers and avoid taking any item for autographs, the league’s latest response in its ongoing monitoring of the coronavirus crisis that has spread to most corners of the planet. An NBA memo said athletes should use those gestures instead of high-fives with fans.The league, in a memo sent to teams and obtained by The Associated Press, offered 10 recommendations to players with hopes of decreasing risks of getting the virus — among them, not taking items such as pens, markers, balls and jerseys from autograph seekers.The NBA also told teams that it is consulting “with infectious disease experts, including the Centers for Disease Control” and infectious disease researchers at Columbia University in New York.“We are also in regular communication with each other, NBA teams including team physicians and athletic trainers, other professional sports leagues, and of course, many of you,” the league wrote in its memo to teams, their physicians and athletic training staffs. ESPN first reported on the contents of the memo.Some players are already heeding the advice.“Corona," Bobby Portis of the New York Knicks said as he offered some fist-bump greetings on Monday night before his team faced the Houston Rockets.Jimmy Butler, of the Miami Heat, said he wasn't necessarily worried or thinking about avoiding high-fives.“I don't think about any of that," Butler said. “I'm still going to be who I am. We're still going to be who we are."Portland guard CJ McCollum said in a tweet that he is taking the matter seriously, saying he is “officially taking a break from signing autographs until further notice.”“You just have to be careful," McCollum said Monday night in Orlando. “Obviously it's affecting people, especially people who are displaying weaker immune systems and people over 60. You've got to check yourself and wash your hands, try to reduce contact with outsiders and outside germs."McCollum has tweeted or retweeted several virus-related posts in the last couple days.“The coronavirus remains a situation with the potential to change rapidly — the NBA and the Players Association will continue to work with leading experts and team physicians to provide up-to-date information and recommended practices that should be followed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” the league said in the memo.Many of the tips offered by the NBA fell under common-sense level of best practices when it comes to illness prevention: avoiding contact with people who are sick, staying home when feeling ill, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. The league also suggested players make sure they “are up to date with all routine vaccinations, including the flu vaccine.”NCAA President Mark Emmert says NCAA Division I basketball tournament games will not be open to the general public because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus.Emmert said in a statement Wednesday that he made the decision to conduct both the men's and women's tournaments, which begin next week, with only essential staff and limited family in attendance. The decision comes after the NCAA's COVID-19 advisory panel of medical experts recommended against playing sporting events open to the general public.Emmert said the NCAA also was looking into moving the men's Final Four from Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium to a smaller arena.In response to the outbreak, the 2020 College Basketball Invitational has been canceled. The Ivy League announced that it would cancel all spring athletics in response to the outbreak.The worldwide death toll has topped 4,000 and the number of those infected rose to more than 100,000 on every continent but Antarctica. In the U.S., the virus has been blamed for multiple deaths.“Containment is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Officials with Major League Baseball previously said they, like the NBA and NHL, have been consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations on a regular basis about COVID-19.

White House unveils $2.5 billion emergency coronavirus request
.W
The White House on Monday sent lawmakers an urgent budget request for $2.5 billion to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

The White House on Monday sent lawmakers an urgent budget request for $2.5 billion to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak, whose rapid spread and threat to the global economy rocked financial markets.The White House budget office said the funds are for vaccines, treatment and protective equipment. The request could advance quickly through Congress and came as coronavirus fears were credited with Monday's 1,000-plus point drop in the Dow Jones Industrials and are increasingly seen as a potential political threat to President Donald Trump.The request was released Monday evening and came as key government accounts were running low. The Department of Health and Human Services had already tapped into an emergency infectious disease rapid response fund and was seeking to transfer more than $130 million from other HHS accounts to combat the virus but is pressing for more.“Today, the Administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,” said White House budget office spokeswoman Rachel Semmel. “We are also freeing up existing resources and allowing for greater flexibilities for response activities.”Senators returning to Washington after a weeklong recess will receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning on the government's coronavirus response, a Senate aide said.“All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic and the administration has no plan,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who blasted a shortage of kits to test for the virus and President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts to health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We have a crisis of coronavirus and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response.”Trump was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's response to the 2014 Ebola scare, which barely touched the U.S. but was seen as a factor in that year's midterm elections, which restored control of the Senate to Republicans.Trump took to Twitter Monday to defend his record.“The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” he tweeted.Among the needs is funding to reimburse the Pentagon, which is housing evacuees from China — who are required to undergo 14-day quarantines — at several military bases in California.Democrats controlling the House wrote HHS Secretary Alex Azar earlier this month to request funds to help speed development of a coronavirus vaccine, expand laboratory capacity and beef up screening efforts at U.S. entry points. Azar is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, and the U.S. response to the outbreak is sure to be a major topic.The White House budget office, led by Russell Vought, worked with HHS to shape the request, with the agency seeking more than the White House is likely to approve. There is a receptive audience for the request on Capitol Hill, though stand-alone emergency spending bills can be tricky to pass since they are invariably a target for lawmakers seeking add-ons.The stock market dove Monday over coronavirus fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping by 3.6% — or more than 1,000 points.The quickly spreading virus has slammed the economy of China, where the virus originated, and caseloads are rapidly increasing in countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy.In San Francisco, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a walking tour of Chinatown on Monday to let the public know the neighborhood is safe and open for business.Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the heavily Chinese American city, visited the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, whose owner Kevin Chan, says his business and others are down 70% since the outbreak of the coronavirus.“Come to Chinatown,” Pelosi said. “Precautions have been taken by our city, we know that there's concern about tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it's very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.”Asked about the Trump administration's looming request, Pelosi said she would want to know how the money would be used.The administration official required anonymity to discuss the request because it is not yet public.

Coronavirus cases in China top SARS as evacuations begin
.W
The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.

Countries began evacuating their citizens Wednesday from the Chinese city hardest-hit by a new virus that has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by SARS.The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.The death toll rose to 132, which is still lower than the 348 people who were killed in China by SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are still many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how transmissible and severe it is.Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States early Wednesday as other countries planned similar evacuations from the city of Wuhan, which authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus.The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.The number of cases in China rose 1,459 from the previous day, a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported Tuesday. Australia and Singapore were among those reporting new cases, as the number outside China topped 70. The vast majority are people who came from Wuhan.Four passengers on the evacuation flight to Japan had coughs and fevers, and two were diagnosed with pneumonia.It wasn't clear whether they were infected with the new virus, which first appeared in Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses.Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to be able to return home.“We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,” Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask.The U.S. plane was headed to California after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 201 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage.Australia, New Zealand and Britain were among the latest countries to announce they are planning evacuations.British Airways said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China after the U.K. government warned against unnecessary travel to the country. The airline has daily flights from London to Shanghai and Beijing.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread.“There's always a balance between the draconian measures of public health and what people might want to do, and obviously it's regrettable if people who turn out not to have the virus are quarantined unnecessarily," he said.The outbreak has affected international sporting events. The International Hockey Federation postponed Pro League games in China, and soccer, basketball and boxing qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympics in February have been moved outside of the country.In Australia, health officials said the Chinese women's national soccer team was quarantined in the city of Brisbane because it had passed through Wuhan a week ago.The team will be kept in isolation in a hotel until Jan. 5. None of the 32 players and staff has shown symptoms.In China's Hubei province, 17 cities, including Wuhan, have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.Sara Platto, an Italian animal behavior researcher and veterinarian, said there were 25 Italians stuck in Wuhan, who stay in touch online for material and emotional support.“My son turned 12 on Jan. 23, the first day of the lockdown in Wuhan. So he couldn’t invite his friends over. We had a remote birthday celebration, with people ‘visiting’ him over WeChat,” Platto said, referring to a Chinese messaging app. “We called it the epidemic birthday.”As much as panic, people spending most of their times indoors have to deal with boredom.Her son, Matteo, usually has a very busy agenda between his school, sports, and volunteer work, but now “it’s like suddenly everything has slowed down,” Platto said. As with other international schools, classes are moving online until the all-clear is sounded.The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. As of December, MERS had sickened nearly 2,500 people since its identification in 2012.The source of the new virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. However, the World Health Organization said most cases reported to date “have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.”Scientists expect many crucial questions about the virus' behavior will be answered in the coming weeks as the outbreak evolves and it becomes clearer how people are infected.Although the Chinese health minister and others have suggested that the virus is spreading before people get symptoms, data to confirm that has not yet been shared widely beyond China.“It’s still unclear whether that takes place,” said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong.If it does, that might explain why China has already exceeded the case numbers for SARS.“The fortunate thing about SARS, if there was anything fortunate, was that transmission did not take place before symptoms,” he said. Peiris said that if it turns out that the new coronavirus can indeed be spread by people who don’t show any symptoms, “a pandemic is a scenario that we have to consider.”             BEIJING

Suspect in Hanukkah stabbings charged with federal hate crimes
.W
The violent attack on the seventh night of Hanukkah occurred amid a series of attacks targeting Jews in the region that have led to increased security, particularly around religious gatherings.

Handwritten journals containing referencing Jews and anti-Semitism were found in the home of a man charged with federal hate crimes Monday in the stabbing of five people celebrating Hanukkah in a rabbi's house north of New York City, authorities said.Grafton E. Thomas, 37, was expected to appear in federal court in White Plains to face five counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by attempting to kill with a dangerous weapon and causing injuries.The attack on the seventh night of Hanukkah occurred amid a series of violent attacks targeting Jews in the region that have led to increased security, particularly around religious gatherings.A criminal complaint said law enforcement agents recovered the journals from his Greenwood Lake, N.Y., residence that included comments such as questioning "why ppl mourned for anti-Semitism when there is Semitic genocide" and a page with drawings of a Star of David and a Swastika.Internet searches on a phone recovered from his car included repeated searches for "Why did Hitler hate the Jews" as well as "German Jewish Temples near me" and "Prominent companies founded by Jews in America," the complaint said.On Dec. 28, the phone's internet browser was used to access an article titled: “New York City Increases Police Presence in Jewish Neighborhoods After Possible Anti-Semitic Attacks. Here's What To Know,” the complaint said.Thomas' family said he was raised to embrace tolerance but has a history of mental illness.“Grafton Thomas has a long history of mental illness and hospitalizations. He has no history of like violent acts and no convictions for any crime,” his family said late Sunday in a statement issued by attorney Michael Sussman. “He has no known history of anti-Semitism and was raised in a home which embraced and respected all religions and races. He is not a member of any hate groups.”“We believe the actions of which he is accused, if committed by him, tragically reflect profound mental illness,” the statement said.Thomas said in court papers filed in a 2013 eviction case in Utah that he suffered from schizophrenia, depression and anxiety and that his “conditions are spontaneous and untamed.”Thomas was arrested within two hours of the Saturday night attack in Monsey. When police pulled his car over in Manhattan, he had blood all over his clothing and smelled of bleach but said “almost nothing" to the arresting officers, officials said.The complaint said authorities recovered a machete under the front passenger seat, and it appeared to have traces of dried blood on it.A knife recovered from the rear of the front passenger seat appeared to have dried blood and hair on it, the complaint said.Thomas' aunt told The Associated Press that Thomas had a “germ phobia” and would obsessively wash his hands and feet with bleach, sometimes several times a day.She said Thomas grew up in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn and “lived peacefully” among Jewish neighbors. She said Thomas had not been taking his medication and recently went missing for a week.The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear she would lose her government job for speaking publicly.“They're making him look like this monster,” she said in a telephone interview. “My nephew is not a monster. He's just sick. He just needs help.”According to the complaint, Thomas, a scarf covering his face, entered the rabbi's home, located next door to a synagogue, and said “no one is leaving.” Thomas then took out a machete and started stabbing and slashing people in a home packed with dozens of congregants, the complaint said.The five victims suffered serious injuries, including a severed finger, slash wounds and deep lacerations, the complaint said. It added that at least one victim was in critical condition with a skull fracture. The rabbi's son was also injured.On Sunday, Thomas pleaded not guilty to five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. He was detained on $5 million bail and refused to answer questions as he was escorted to a vehicle.Thomas' criminal history includes an arrest for assaulting a police horse, according to an official briefed on the investigation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. A lawyer representing Thomas at the arraignment said he had no convictions.The street in the rural village of Greenwood Lake, where Thomas lived with his mother, about 20 miles from Monsey, was blocked with police tape Sunday as FBI agents and police officers carried items from their home.The attack was the latest in a string of violence targeting Jews in the region, including a Dec. 10 massacre at a kosher grocery store in New Jersey. Last month in Monsey, a man was stabbed while walking to a synagogue.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday's savagery was the 13th anti-Semitic attack in New York since Dec. 8.According to the official briefed on the investigation, authorities do not believe Thomas is connected to recent anti-Semitic incidents in New York City.Rockland County, which includes Monsey, announced Monday that a private firm has volunteered to operate armed security for certain synagogues. County Executive Ed Day denounced the attack during a press conference Monday.Thomas’ mother sat on the front row at the event with a tissue in her hand but did not comment. Before the event started, she cried in the back of the room near her attorney.In the statement released by Thomas' lawyer, his family expressed its "deepest concern and prayers for those injured physically and otherwise deeply affected by the events of Saturday night. ... We thank those who rendered medical attention to each of those injured.”Monsey, near the New Jersey state line about 35 miles north of New York City, is one of several Hudson Valley communities that has seen a rising population of Hasidic Jews in recent years.At a celebration in Monsey on Sunday that was planned before the attack, several members of the community stood guard armed with assault-style rifles. They refused to give their names when approached by an AP journalist, but they said they were there to defend their community.“The Jewish community is utterly terrified," Evan Bernstein, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey, said in a statement. “No one should have to live like this."President Donald Trump condemned the “horrific" attack, saying in a tweet Sunday that “We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism."In New York City, the Rev. Al Sharpton appeared with Jewish and other faith leaders at his Harlem headquarters and said that he was disturbed and upset that several of the alleged perpetrators of recent attacks on Jews have been black.“We cannot remain silent as we see a consistent pattern of attacks on people based on their faith and who they are,” Sharpton said. “You can’t fight hate against you if you aren’t willing to fight hate against everybody else.”             MONSEY, N.Y.

Tornado or virus? Pandemic means tough sheltering decisions
.W
So far, sheltering from deadly weather appears to be taking precedent over staying away from a potentially deadly disease, but not for everyone.

As each day brings the United States closer to peak severe weather season, Tornado Alley residents are facing a difficult question: Is it better to take on a twister outside a community shelter or to face the possibility of contracting the new coronavirus inside one?So far, sheltering from deadly weather appears to be taking precedent over staying away from a potentially deadly disease, but not for everyone.In north Alabama, where powerful tornadoes killed dozens in recent years, a little more than 700 people showed up at three shelters — a turnout that was actually larger than usual, due to especially dire storm predictions — when potentially dangerous weather threatened the Tennessee Valley in late March.Two of the shelters were located in schools, where workers urged people to stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart in accordance with pandemic rules about social distancing, said Decatur Police Chief Nate Allen. They also asked whether anyone felt ill, and people who said they did were directed to an isolation room near an exterior door."They were pretty honest about it," Allen said. One elderly couple who were concerned about both disease and twisters locked themselves in a teachers lounge, he said.No one was hurt in the storms, and Allen said authorities haven't heard of any health problems linked to the sheltering, which lasted about an hour.But the need for shelters and people's concerns about going to them during a historic pandemic will surely arise again soon. Forecasters said there was a chance of powerful storms in Texas on Thursday, and severe weather including tornadoes could threaten the South from Louisiana to Georgia on Easter Sunday.April through June is peak tornado season in the United States, which averaged about 1,250 tornadoes annually in the decade ending in 2010, according to statistics from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.The Plains, the Midwest and the Southeast are particularly vulnerable, with a six-state region including Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas most likely to get hit by strong twisters, the records show.Emergency planners, health officials and forecasters are generally advising people to take their chances with the virus when a tornado is headed their way."We should not let fear of the coronavirus blind us to the danger of an imminent tornado," Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said in a statement. “If you have to seek refuge in a community shelter, try to practice social distancing and other precautions as much as possible to minimize your risk.”The National Weather Service and the Alabama Department of Public Health put it more bluntly in a joint statement as severe weather approached last month while virus worries were growing.“If a warning is issued for your area, you are more likely to be affected by the tornado than the virus,” it said.For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Home health worker Flora Thomas would rather take her chances with a twister than the new coronavirus, even though a monster tornado in 2011 killed more than 50 people, badly damaged her home and shattered her Tuscaloosa neighborhood, where there are still more empty lots than rebuilt homes.“I'm more worried about the virus. I would stay home,” Thomas said. Christopher Hood, who lives nearby, agrees.“Packed in with a bunch of other people in a shelter? I wouldn't want to be in that position right now,” said Hood.In southeastern Mississippi last week, residents didn't have a choice about what to do. Within moments of the first warning, a tornado tore an 8-mile-long path of destruction through the area, with homes ripped apart and sheds flying through the air, said George County Emergency Management Director Nancy Smith.“There was no time to think about opening shelters,” Smith said.Tornado season eventually gives way to hurricane season, which begins June 1, and officials along the coast already are considering what to do should a tropical storm system draw near while the region is still under lockdown because of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.In Panama City, Florida, which was devastated by Hurricane Michael in October 2018, emergency services director Frankie Lumm said he plans to open more shelters than usual and have more rooms in each than he typically does, to allow for social distancing.But even that won't be simple: The area is still low on shelters because schools are still being rebuilt after Michael, he said, and providing staffing for additional shelters could be a challenge during a pandemic.“The rock meets a hard place if I begin to have a hurricane while this is still in full mode,” Lumm said.

Democrats stall President Trump's $250 billion business coronavirus aid package
.W
Democrats and Republicans agree the aid is urgently needed. The dispute is over billions more Democrats want to add to the legislation.

Senate Democrats on Thursday stalled President Donald Trump’s request for $250 billion to supplement a “paycheck protection” program for businesses crippled by the coronavirus outbreak, demanding protections for minority-owned businesses and money for health care providers and state and local governments.They sidetracked a request by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to give the unanimous consent necessary to fast-track Trump’s request.“We need more funding and we need it fast,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate, assuring them there would be future bills to deal with other issues.Democrats' demands sparked a spirited response from McConnell, who implored them not to block “emergency aid you do not even oppose just because you want something more.”“Nobody thinks this will be the Senate’s last word on COVID-19. We don’t have to do everything right now,” McConnell said. "Let’s continue to work together, with speed and bipartisanship. We will get through this crisis together.”Thursday's Senate development doesn't mean the legislation is dead. Democrats and Republicans agree the aid is urgently needed. The dispute is over billions more Democrats want to add to the legislation.McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin say the business program, which involves direct subsidies to companies to keep employees on payroll and pay their rent, is on track to quickly deplete its first $350 billion infusion as businesses rush to apply for the aid.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accused McConnell of trying to ram through legislation without trying to create the consensus needed to pass a bill into law in the current environment. He detailed a variety of glitches in the program and fears that many big lenders are not serving minority neighborhoods and nontraditional borrowers.Van Hollen said McConnell “knew full well that there was not agreement and consensus on moving forward with this proposal. that’s why we’re here today. This was in fact designed to fail, designed as a political stunt.”Democrats’ requests, like aid to states and hospitals, mirror programs that are already funded but the money is flowing more slowly.McConnell said Democrats are trying “to use this crucial program to open broader negotiations on other topics, including parts of the CARES Act where literally no money has gone out the door yet.”The future of the legislation is likely to be determined between Pelosi and McConnell, who do much of their communicating in public statements.In interviews, Pelosi has stressed making sure that the popular paycheck protection program, part of the massive $2.2 trillion economic aid Congress passed in March, delivers benefits to businesses in minority communities that are often under-served by traditional lenders.“One of the concerns that we have about the original $350 (billion) is that a lot of ... people who are under-banked are unserved on that basis,” Pelosi told NPR on Wednesday. “So, they don’t have banking relationships sophisticated in a way that others do.”Democrats are pressing for half of the White House request, or $125 billion, to be channeled through community-based financial institutions that serve farmers, family, women, minority and veteran-owned small businesses and nonprofits in rural, tribal, suburban and urban communities.They circulated a $500 billion plan that would add $100 billion for hospitals and other health care providers and $150 billion to state and local governments, as well as a $15% boost in food stamp benefits. They hope this serves as a basis for talks with McConnell going forward.Pelosi said McConnell’s request “simply can’t” advance through the Democratic-controlled House under unanimous consent. There’s also lone wolf Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who promises to block efforts to pass such huge legislation without lawmakers present and ready to vote.The government is just beginning to implement three previously passed bills to respond to the unprecedented coronavirus outbreak, which has caused grave damage to the economy in addition to the personal toll.The massive infusions of federal cash — the $250 billion sought by the administration would come on top of combined legislation already totaling about $2.5 trillion -- are intended as a patch to help the $21 trillion U.S. economy through the current recession, which is causing an economic contraction and spike in joblessness overwhelming many state systems for delivering unemployment benefits.Still, signs of potential progress emerged in Washington’s effort to push cash out the door to suddenly out-of-work Americans and shuttered businesses.The first $1,200 direct payments to Americans are set to begin next week, Mnuchin told House Democrats during a conference call Wednesday with the administration’s coronavirus task force.Mnuchin also told the lawmakers that $98 billion in loans for small businesses has been approved under the program which the Trump administration wants Congress to bolster according to a person unauthorized to discuss the private call and granted anonymity.The battle is taking place as Capitol Hill is virtually shut down as the nation and the economy are virtually shuttered to stop the spread of the virus.The continued spread of the virus has prompted Congress’ top security and medical officials to extend the closure to the public of the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center and the adjacent congressional office buildings through April.The buildings were initially closed only through March. Members of Congress, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will continue to be admitted, according to a March 30 memo.             WASHINGTON

'It's just a nightmare': Trash collectors overwhelmed by rising amount of household waste
.W
The entire waste management industry is trying to keep employees healthy and safe so they can handle the massive influx of household trash that is accumulating as more Americans self-quarantine at home.

Barney Shapiro, owner of Tenleytown Trash, never expected that he would turn to the Washington National Opera's costume department to design gear for his employees. But when a member of his staff heard the National Opera was sewing masks for workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, he jumped at the chance.Shapiro's staffers haul trash in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. Like the entire waste management industry, Shapiro is trying to keep his employees healthy and safe so they can handle the massive influx of household trash that is accumulating as more Americans self-quarantine at home."Our residential volumes are drastically increased," Shapiro said. "People are calling in and asking for increased services. We can't do that on a short-term basis. It's just a nightmare."Republic Services, one of the largest waste management companies in the U.S., said it expects the volume of residential garbage to increase by as much as 30%. In order to redirect resources and address the growing amount of day-to-day household waste, about 50 communities nationwide have paused curbside recycling pickup and dozens have suspended yard waste collection, according to the Solid Waste Association of America. Other companies are shifting workers to residential routes and away from slower commercial routes where many of the businesses have closed.Companies are also making contingency plans in case the residential volume becomes too great or their workers get sick.Shapiro said one of his drivers and the colleague he rides with have both tested positive for coronavirus, as well as one of his administrative employees.Another driver recently said he was scared to work and is staying home, according to Shapiro. And Shapiro, who employs 32 drivers, is growing concerned that more employees will want to do the same."I hate to say this. Those things do tend to snowball," he said. "I can't say to a driver, 'No, I want you working.' Quite honestly, they're being put at risk."David Biderman, CEO of the Solid Waste Association of North America, said the industry has seen a slight uptick in absenteeism so far. That's mostly been due to workers who have been quarantined after a potential exposure to the virus or who need to stay home because their kids are out of school. But he expects those absenteeism figures to increase, especially in areas that have yet to start to flatten the curve when it comes to new coronavirus cases and fatalities.At Tenleytown Trash, all of Shapiro's backup drivers have been called in and he has hired an extra worker just to keep everything sanitized. Shapiro said the company's trucks are sanitized daily and cleanings at its offices have increased, too.All of this is adding pressure to the industry when its services are needed the most.Bill Rumpke Jr., CEO of Rumpke Waste & Recycling, has hired 36 new employees in the last week to deal with an increase in residential volume in the markets where it operates in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia.Rumpke said he's facing financial losses due to the dramatic drop in commercial and industrial business, but his main concern right now is keeping his employees safe and meeting the increased demand for residential waste pickups. He's prepared to suspend yard waste and bulk trash pickup if necessary."We've been able to stay ahead of it so far," Rumpke said. "Hopefully, we'll be able to stay on schedule."To offset increased labor costs and declining revenue, Rumpke said the company plans to cut back on other expenses, such as a planned IT project and the purchase of new heavy equipment.The challenge of coronavirus is unlike anything the company has faced in its 88 years of operation, Rumpke said. If there's an outbreak among its staff, the company is preparing to shift labor between its markets or to delay service.One way Americans can help, said Biderman, is to hold off on spring cleaning and limit curbside waste." going to put additional pressure on an already pressured solid waste collection system," Biderman said.

Fact Check: Social media posts make baseless claim on COVID-19 death toll
.W
Viral posts wrongly suggest that the COVID-19 death toll is exaggerated because “the state” has instructed that “anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident” be listed as a coronavirus victim.

Posted on April 8, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.Many experts believe the number of deaths linked to the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is likely higher than the figures available — due to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across locales.One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform.The repeatedly shared posts — citing the user’s purported recollection of a woman’s claim on a “live broadcast” — argue that “the state” has instructed “that anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident” should be “listed as COVID-19 victims.” It claims “the numbers are a lie” and calls for an investigation.We attempted to contact the user responsible for the original post, to no avail, so we don’t know what “state” was being referenced. But there’s no evidence that any state has adopted a policy to classify all deaths, regardless of the individual circumstances, as being related to COVID-19.Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, called the allegation “ridiculous.”“Death certificates are basically federal, and each state has a public health division that answers to the  for death certification,” Aiken, the Spokane County, Washington, medical examiner, told us in an email. “For all practical purposes death certification is directed by the feds, via health departments.”Contrary to the Facebook posts, Aiken said, “Medical Examiners and Coroners certify hundreds to thousands of deaths each year, using investigation, autopsies, and medical tests as required, and do not choose a ‘default diagnosis’ such as COVID-19.”Aiken pointed out that CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance was issued April 2. “If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the , as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),” the guidance says. “In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.”The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'”One hypothetical example cited by the CDC is an 86-year-old woman dying after exhibiting symptoms such as a high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing, “after being exposed to an ill family member who subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19.” The CDC says that “probable COVID-19” may be listed as the underlying cause of death — a deduction made “given the patient’s symptoms and exposure to an infected individual.”There was renewed attention given to the theory of the death toll being inflated after Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said during an April 7 press conference that “if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.”Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner of New York City and a high-profile pathologist, told Fox News that it’s reasonable to include people with the virus, who also had other health issues, in the count.“In the normal course, autopsies would then determine whether the person died of the effects of the COVID virus, whether the person had a brain tumor or brain hemorrhage for example that might be unrelated to it and what the relative significance of both the infection and the pre-existing disease is,” he said. Even if the number of autopsies being conducted are low because of concerns of infection, he said, “then you will include in those numbers some people who did have a pre-existing condition that would have caused death anyway, but that’s probably a small number.”Likewise, Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told us in an email: “There are going to be some people who die of something else, happen to have COVID and get tested, and get counted as COVID deaths but would die anyway. It would be wrong to say that number is zero. However given current testing shortages and protocols, the number of such cases will be small.”“A greater issue is errors in the other direction — deaths caused by COVID that are not counted as such,” he said.Lipsitch cited at least two reasons for that underreporting: Someone having and dying from clear COVID-19 respiratory symptoms but never being tested (especially early in the epidemic, when tests were scarce). Or, he said, someone dying from causes, such as a heart attack or stroke, triggered by the infection — with no one ever suspecting or testing for the disease.This is not an isolated issue: A 2013 study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. found that lab-confirmed tests accounted for only about 1 in every 7 deaths attributable to the disease.“So overall it seems likely that while a few individuals who would have died anyway are getting called COVID deaths, there are  more deaths caused by COVID that are not being attributed to COVID,” Lipsitch said. And it is “simply not true that anyone who dies of something other than a car accident or gunshot wound is attributed to COVID.”In New York City, an epicenter for the outbreak with more than 4,000 reported deaths, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had not been counting the many deaths happening at home if the individuals had not been confirmed to have the disease. After a WNYC and Gothamist report on a sharp increase in the number of daily deaths happening at home in the city — and the suspected undercounting of cases — city officials said they would begin to include suspected cases in their counts.Gary Watts — the coroner for Richland County, South Carolina, and president of the International Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners — also told us that the notion that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are somehow being inflated didn’t make sense to him.Watts said in a phone interview if an individual with a pre-existing condition, such as a heart disease or COPD, gets the virus, “COVID-19 is going to be a very detrimental complication to your already existing disease.” Someone could live for years with COPD, for example, then die within weeks after getting COVID-19. In such cases, when the person is confirmed to have the virus, COVID-19 would be listed as a contributing factor.In terms of known COVID-19 related deaths in hospitals, Watts said hospitals certify deaths and report that information. He said his office is only conducting postmortem tests for COVID-19 in limited cases — if the decedent was healthy, for example, and family indicated he or she had COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.Watts said the purpose is to determine the cause of death but also “as a safety precaution for the first responders” who had contact with the individual. But if there was a clear cause of death — say, a stabbing — with no relation to COVID-19, Watts said he would not include the disease, even if the decedent tested positive.“If it was not related to the cause of death, then I’m not going to list it,” he said.As of April 8, there have been more than 14,000 COVID-19 related deaths reported in the U.S., according to a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.“The true facts are that COVID-19 deaths will likely be underreported on death certificates and not over-reported,” Aiken said. “This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount. Not all jurisdictions are able to test home deaths with typical symptoms for COVID-19.”                        Posted on April 8, 2020                                                                                                           Advertisement                       We are collaborating with  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.

Creative mail carrier delivers joy with wild costumes

It is not uncommon for people to stop her on her route and ask for a picture after patiently waiting for her arrival.

While many businesses have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, mail remains an essential service throughout the state of North Carolina.  One carrier in southern Winston-Salem is delivering more than bills, medicine and magazines though.  She is also delivering joy.For the last week and a half she has been dressing up in a variety of wacky outfits, much to the delight of the people on her route and her friends on Facebook.Traci Lewis says her parents raised her to work hard and laugh as much as possible.  She also says she's heavily involved in Girl Scouts, where she teaches young women to make the world a better place and make people smile."And the third reason is, it makes me feel better," she says with a chuckle.So far she has dressed up as a shark, a butterfly, a pirate, a bee, 'quarantine casual Friday,' and road construction, complete with an orange cone on her head.  It is not uncommon for people to stop her on her route and ask for a picture after patiently waiting for her arrival."She brings joy to a time where it is one of those depressing times," says Gwen Whitaker, who lives along her route."It's almost like the ice cream truck pulling up when you're a little kid.""We've been locked in the house and it's just so fun to come out and see her every day.  She's such a joy," said Vicki Baltierrez, another neighbor.Mail carriers are some of the few remaining workers right now, carrying out a job that cannot be done from home and requires regular human contact.  For the most part, Lewis is only touching mailboxes, but she also carries hand sanitizer, a mask and gloves when someone has to sign for a package.  She also makes sure to maintain social distancing when she is taking pictures. Lewis says she plans to keep dressing up until she's told not to, the shelter-in-place-order is lifted, or she runs out of ideas."It makes me feel like I'm actually making a difference for a few people and in a way that I actually can," she says.

Airlines, TSA report 96% drop in air travel as pandemic continues
.W
The numbers are at a 10-year low, according to the Transportation Security Administration.

The number of people traveling by plane has dropped by about 96% amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to multiple metrics.On Wednesday, Transportation Security Administration officers screened just shy of 95,000 people at airport checkpoints, a dramatic drop from the 2.3 million who passed through on the equivalent day in 2019. The numbers are at a 10-year low, according to the agency.  The drop in passengers and orders across much of the country to stay at home have caused airlines to cut 71% of their capacity, according to Airlines for America, an industry group that represents carriers such as American, Delta, Southwest and United.Only about one in every 10 seats on the U.S. domestic planes that do fly are occupied, the group says.On the limited number of international flights that are operating, about one in five seats are occupied, it says.With fewer flights, airlines need fewer planes. U.S. airlines currently have about 1,800 planes, or 1,500 more than in December, parked, representing about 30% of the fleet.The stark numbers are similar worldwide.At the beginning of the year, about 111,000 commercial flights were operated daily, according to Airlines for America. In the most recent week, it said there were only 31,000 flights.The International Air Transport Association, which represents nearly 300 airlines worldwide, says it expects airlines to burn through $60 billion in cash this quarter. The largest slide of that will be in refunds owed to customers, it said.Related video: Travel blogger says if an airline cancels flight, you should get refundU.S. regulators recently directed airlines under their auspices to refund customers in cash, rather than credit, after it reported a spike in customer complaints.The passenger airlines are also currently awaiting their first payments from a $25 billion federal fund meant to help them meet payroll. They are also awaiting details on how to apply for another $25 billion in loans.Several U.S. regional airlines have been forced to suspend operations or close because of the dramatic drop in bookings. The Federal Aviation Administration says employees at 38 of its air traffic control facilities have tested positive for the virus, prompting altered operations and cleanings. Most recently, it said employees in Orlando and Newark tested positive.At TSA checkpoints, officers now wear masks and — in some cases — face shields. The agency says 327 employees have tested positive for the virus and two have died. The agency has closed some checkpoints due to inadequate staffing, according to an aviation official familiar with the matter. Airlines have also seen employees fall ill; about 100 American Airlines flight attendants have contracted COVID-19, according to their union.TSA employees at the Dulles airport outside Washington, DC, also created a food pantry for their colleagues in the aviation world.

Fauci: Coronavirus hospitalizations dropping due to social distancing
.W
While social distancing and sheltering in place appear to be working, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cautioned that people shouldn't let down their guard.

The number of coronavirus patients in New York and Connecticut is starting to rise at a slower rate and the nation's top infectious disease official says it's a sign that social distancing is working."At the same time as we're seeing the increase in deaths, we're seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations," Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday."That means that what we are doing is working and therefore we need to continue to do it," Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, added.Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the most powerful weapon against coronavirus is social distancing."We're not defenseless," Redfield said in CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday. "This virus has a very significant weakness: It can't swim 7 feet."Earlier Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state had its lowest daily jump in hospitalizations "since this nightmare started."New York, the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak, has more than 161,000 confirmed cases of its own but had only about 200 new hospitalizations Wednesday, the governor said."You're not out of the woods," Cuomo said in a news conference Thursday. "We've done some great things and we've saved lives because we've followed these policies (like staying at home)." More than 465,000 known coronavirus cases and at least 16,000 deaths have been reported in the United States. States across the country have issued stay-at-home orders, leaving many workers idle and health care workers scrambling to treat the increasing number of patients.But Wednesday also was the state's deadliest day of the outbreak, with 799 deaths. Cuomo has said deaths are a lagging indicator, because those who die tend to have been hospitalized the longest.Cuomo was among several governors who said they were encouraged by the impact that social distancing is having against the spread of the virus.Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said during a call with small business leaders that new hospitalizations dropped to their lowest point in two weeks. Meanwhile, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state has the lowest number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people compared to other southern states.The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Ohio continues to increase but Gov. Mike DeWine said "things are not as bad as they might have been" because the number of people impacted by the virus is lower than previously projected."So, is it time to celebrate? No," DeWine told reporters Thursday. "The game is not over."Ohio, Minnesota and New Mexico have extended their stay-at-home orders into May while national social distancing guidelines are currently running through at least April 30.US to reach highest daily number of deaths Sunday, experts sayThe Trump administration and health officials are navigating potentially competing circumstances: Hard economic news, as workers stay home; and indications that social distancing is helping to keep coronavirus deaths down. While maintaining social distancing measures appears to be holding down the spread in some areas, experts say the country is not ready to shift to a more normal life yet.Easing social distancing too soon risks "a huge resurgence — and much worse than what we've seen already," Crystal Watson, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins' public health school, told CNN on Thursday.Watson co-authored a report suggesting prerequisites for reopening the economy, including a sustained reduction in cases for 14 days, and improved abilities to test people and monitor and trace cases.The United States is set to reach its highest daily number of deaths on or around Sunday, according to models by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.The highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day came Wednesday with 1,922, according to data supplied by Johns Hopkins University.The IHME estimated 60,415 in the U.S. would die of coronavirus disease by August, assuming social-distancing policies continue through May. That projection is down from the figure that the model predicted earlier in the week: 82,000.That decrease is thanks to the actions taken by Americans, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said."What has been so remarkable, I think, to those of us that have been in the science field for so long," Birx said, "is how important behavioral change is, and how amazing Americans are at adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes."Some hospitals in hot spots such as Detroit and New York, however, still are straining to keep up with the weeks of influx in patients. Detroit's Sinai-Grace Hospital has been so overwhelmed, at least two people have died in its emergency room hallways before help can arrive, health care workers there told CNN.Fauci speculates Americans could take summer vacations, but there are caveatsAmericans have the potential to take summer vacations this year — provided that the country continues aggressive mitigation efforts now and gets to a place where it can modify them, Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official said Thursday.On "CBS This Morning" Thursday, Fauci was asked whether he could envision a typical summer with vacations, baseball games, weddings and family reunions."It can be in the cards," Fauci told CBS.But, he warned: "When we pull back and try to open up the country ... we have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again," the country has a way to aggressively and effectively "identify, isolate, contract trace and make sure we don't have those spikes we have now."Moving toward normalcy will be gradual, and could be different by region, he said."Hopefully, by the time we get to the summer, we will have taken many steps in that direction" that would allow some normalization.Fauci has consistently stressed social distancing should be maintained now, and that the virus, not people's wishes, "makes the timeline" about when measures could be relaxed. Philadelphia and DC expected to be new hot spots, official saysPhiladelphia and Washington, DC, are expected to be new hot spots for the coronavirus pandemic, Birx said in a conference call with House Democrats Wednesday, according to a source on the call.Birx added that the Philadelphia metropolitan area is seeing 1,400 cases per day. Washington has had about 500 new cases per day, and Baltimore has had 200 new cases daily.Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday she has ordered grocery stores to post signs instructing shoppers to wear face masks, and to enter alone or with household members.                        The number of coronavirus patients in New York and Connecticut is starting to rise at a slower rate and the nation's top infectious disease official says it's a sign that social distancing is working. "At the same time as we're seeing the increase in deaths, we're seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations," Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday.

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the most powerful weapon against coronavirus is social distancing. "We're not defenseless," Redfield said in CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday. "This virus has a very significant weakness: It can't swim 7 feet." Earlier Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state had its lowest daily jump in hospitalizations "since this nightmare started." New York,  the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak , has more than 161,000 confirmed cases of its own but had only about 200 new hospitalizations Wednesday, the governor said. "You're not out of the woods," Cuomo said in a news conference Thursday. "We've done some great things and we've saved lives because we've followed these policies (like staying at home)."  More  than 465,000 known coronavirus cases and at least 16,000 deaths  have been reported in the United States. States across the country have issued stay-at-home orders, leaving many workers idle and health care workers scrambling to treat the increasing number of patients.                                                                                                       How to support a friend who lost someone to COVID-19                          But Wednesday also was the state's deadliest day of the outbreak, with 799 deaths. Cuomo has said deaths are a lagging indicator, because those who die tend to have been hospitalized the longest. Cuomo was among several governors who said they were encouraged by the impact that social distancing is having against the spread of the virus. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said during a call with small business leaders that new hospitalizations dropped to their lowest point in two weeks. Meanwhile, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state has the lowest number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people compared to other southern states. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Ohio continues to increase but Gov. Mike DeWine said "things are not as bad as they might have been" because the number of people impacted by the virus is lower than previously projected. "So, is it time to celebrate? No," DeWine told reporters Thursday. "The game is not over." Ohio, Minnesota and New Mexico have extended their stay-at-home orders into May while national social distancing guidelines are currently running through  at least April 30 . US to reach highest daily number of deaths Sunday, experts say The Trump administration and health officials are navigating potentially competing circumstances: Hard economic news, as workers stay home; and indications that social distancing is helping to  keep coronavirus deaths down .  While maintaining social distancing measures appears to be holding down the spread in some areas, experts say the country is not ready to shift to a more normal life yet. Easing social distancing too soon risks "a huge resurgence — and much worse than what we've seen already," Crystal Watson, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins' public health school, told CNN on Thursday. Watson  co-authored a report  suggesting prerequisites for reopening the economy, including a sustained reduction in cases for 14 days, and improved abilities to test people and monitor and trace cases. The United States is set to reach its highest daily number of deaths on or around Sunday, according to models by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. The highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day came Wednesday with 1,922, according to data supplied by Johns Hopkins University. The IHME  estimated  60,415 in the U.S. would die of coronavirus disease by August, assuming social-distancing policies continue through May. That projection is down from the figure that the model  predicted earlier in the week : 82,000. That decrease is  thanks to the actions taken by Americans , White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said. "What has been so remarkable, I think, to those of us that have been in the science field for so long," Birx said, "is how important behavioral change is, and how amazing Americans are at adapting to and following through on these behavioral changes." Some hospitals in hot spots such as Detroit and New York, however, still are straining to keep up with the weeks of influx in patients. Detroit's Sinai-Grace Hospital has been so overwhelmed, at least  two people have died in its emergency room hallways  before help can arrive, health care workers there told CNN. Fauci speculates Americans could take summer vacations, but there are caveats Americans have the potential to take summer vacations this year — provided that the country continues aggressive mitigation efforts now and gets to a place where it can modify them, Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official said Thursday. On "CBS This Morning" Thursday, Fauci was asked whether he could envision a typical summer with  vacations , baseball games, weddings and family reunions. "It can be in the cards," Fauci told CBS. But, he warned: "When we pull back and try to open up the country ... we have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again," the country has a way to aggressively and effectively "identify, isolate, contract trace and make sure we don't have those spikes we have now." Moving toward normalcy will be gradual, and could be different by region, he said. "Hopefully, by the time we get to the summer, we will have taken many steps in that direction" that would allow some normalization. Fauci has consistently stressed social distancing should be maintained now, and that the virus, not people's wishes, " makes the timeline " about when measures could be relaxed.  Philadelphia and DC expected to be new hot spots, official says Philadelphia and Washington, DC, are  expected to be new hot spots  for the coronavirus pandemic, Birx said in a conference call with House Democrats Wednesday, according to a source on the call. Birx added that the Philadelphia metropolitan area is seeing 1,400 cases per day. Washington has had about 500 new cases per day, and Baltimore has had 200 new cases daily. Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday she has ordered grocery stores to post signs instructing shoppers to wear face masks, and to enter alone or with household members.

The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults — ages 60 and up — who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.

The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults — ages 60 and up — who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.Some tips are applicable to every generation, but there are specific precautions older adults should take to protect their health.Related video above: How some assisted living facilities are responding to coronavirus concernsWe spoke to two geriatricians and pulled guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assemble what people 60 and up need to know about the novel coronavirus.But remember: Recommendations for COVID-19 may change as officials learn more, so monitor your local health department and the CDC for updates.What's your risk level The CDC says "older adults" and people with severe chronic illness are more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19.Infectious disease experts define "older adults" as anyone age 60 and up, so people in that age group should be cautious.It's possible to contract the virus at a younger age — it's just more dangerous in older adults because the immune system weakens with age, said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto.People over the age of 80 may want to exercise even more caution. A report published in the medical journal JAMA that examined more than 72,000 Chinese coronavirus patients found that the overall fatality rate was 2.3%. But in adults over 80, the fatality rate rose to 15%.If you live in a community where there's an outbreak, you're at a higher risk of infection, too. Follow the advice below.What precautions you should take now Cancel all non-essential doctor's appointments, said Dr. Carla Perissinotto, an associate professor in the Geriatrics Division of the University of California-San Francisco's Department of Medicine.Whether it's a standard check-up, a follow-up appointment for a stable condition or an elective procedure, if it can wait, then it should. If you have an important appointment coming up, consider doing it in a video call or from your smartphone. Telehealth tech lets physicians confer with patients who may not be able to leave their homes. Tell a friend, a loved one, a co-worker or a neighbor if you're concerned about the illness. Appoint one of them as an emergency contact who you can call with concerns or requests for help. Otherwise, do what you'd do during flu season: Wash your hands frequently, the right way (get ready to read that a lot). Use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available, though washing your hands is preferred.What you should stock up onThe CDC recommends keeping enough groceries and toiletries on hand to last you a "prolonged period of time." There's no timeline for the COVID-19 outbreak, though, so think basic.Stock up on toothpaste, detergent, water filters, etc.Make meals and freeze them if you're concerned about food. But stocking up on medication ahead of time isn't always plausible, Perissinotto said. You may be able to switch to a 90-day supply for your prescription. If this isn't possible, the CDC suggests mail ordering medications.How you should alter daily activitiesOlder adults living in communities where the virus has spread should take extra precautions.Avoid public places where crowds may gather or poorly ventilated buildings where the risk of transmission is higher, the CDC said. You don't need to shut yourself off from public life — just be vigilant when you enter it. Older adults should still exercise and eat right, just as they would at any other time of the year, Sinha said. And again, constant — and proper — handwashing before, during and after a trip into the public is necessary.Related video: Why 'social distancing' and self-quarantine measures save lives during the coronavirus outbreakHow you should handle travelThe CDC advises against non-essential plane travel for older adults. Several U.S. airlines have already slashed their flight schedules for the next few months.It's wise to stay off cruise ships for now, too. Cruise passengers are at an increased risk of person-to-person transmission with all the tight quarters, the CDC said, so if you're already made cruise plans, it's best to cancel them.What you need to know about self-isolationThe CDC recommends that high-risk groups in communities with outbreaks stay home as much as possible and that people who believe they're sick isolate themselves.But long-term isolation can be damaging. Perissinotto studies the effects of social isolation in older adults, and she said that loneliness and depression are "huge risks for mortality.""I don't think the solution of totally being devoid of social contact is the answer," she said. "Yes, there is some prudence we need to have in social distancing, but we also have to be careful to not isolate more — it can be very detrimental."So if you need to isolate yourself:Don't cut off contact with family or friends. Keep in touch to update them on your condition and curb boredom. If groups you're a member of are still meeting and none of the other members are sick, Perissinotto said it should be OK to go.Just exercise caution. It's an individual choice, so if skipping out would reduce some anxiety, that's fine, too.And if you do go, be sure to wash your hands with soap.What your family can do To help you, your family should think ahead.Perissinotto recommends that family, friends and neighbors of older adults do some inventory in case the older adult needs to isolate at home.Does this person have what they need to spend an extended period of time inside? If not, help them prepare supplies. If their caregiver calls in sick, is there someone who can step in to take care of them? Have a plan in place to make sure they'll get care if they need it.If they have a telemedicine appointment coming up, will they know how to access it? Set up the tech and show them how to use it to speak with their physician. Getting prepared and keeping in touch can help keep families connected if an older member needs to isolate, Perissinotto said.And, of course, sick family members should not visit — stick to a phone or video call. And if a younger, healthy family member has potentially come into contact with a COVID-19 patient, they should self-isolate and avoid seeing older, susceptible family members.What you should consider about nursing homesIt's natural to be fearful for family in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, Sinha said: Older people and people with chronic illnesses, both high-risk groups, are living together in tight quarters.The good news: Most nursing homes and long-term care facilities are prepared for pandemics, Perissonotto said.The CDC provides training for long-term care facilities on how to operate during pandemics. If you're concerned about the safety of your family member or want to learn about the protocol their facility is following, contact staff at the facility.What you should do when visiting loved ones at nursing homesThis depends on whether the nursing home is accepting visitors.The CDC doesn't recommend a blanket-ban on visitors — just those who show respiratory symptoms, like coughing and sneezing. The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine recommends that facilities screen visitors before entering in outbreak areas.Some long-term care facilities have stopped allowing visitors to protect their patients. Call your facility ahead of time to find out its current policy and set up an alternative mode of communication between residents and family.And it goes without saying, but if you're sick, don't visit.What to do if you're sickIf you think you have the novel coronavirus: Stay home and call your physician. If they think you should come in for a test, limit your interaction with other people and don't use public transportation. They may provide a face mask for you to wear while in their office.If your doctor is not immediately available:  Consider calling a local coronavirus hotline. Some city, county and state health departments have numbers you can call to discuss your symptoms and learn more about the virus's impact on the community. Keep in mind that these hotlines are meant as informational resources, and it's impossible to diagnose COVID-19 without a test.If you're diagnosed with the novel coronavirus and your illness is mild: Your physician may advise that you stay home until you recover. If your symptoms are more severe, you may be hospitalized so physicians can monitor your condition.                         The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults — ages 60 and up — who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.

Why stores could start taking customers' temperatures
.W
Some stores have begun taking employees' temperatures to keep sick workers home. But that doesn't keep employees safe from sick customers.

Stores are scrambling to protect their workers from coronavirus.Some have begun taking employees' temperatures to keep sick workers home. But that doesn't keep employees safe from sick customers.That's why a number of stores are considering taking customers' temperatures before they enter. Public health experts say it is a prudent step: Grocery stores are one of the few public spaces still open. Millions of Americans visit them every day and come into close contact with store employees."If they decided to roll such a program to their workers, under the assumption that it would prevent infected individuals from being at their stores, I do not see a reason why that wouldn't be rolled out to customers as well," said Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council under President Donald Trump and former acting chief scientist at the FDA.

States, schools finding ways to continue reduced, free meals even as schools close due to outbreak

Federal officials are seeking to make sure all students in meal programs will continue to get access.

School meals for those in need can continue even as coronavirus issues close schools, but federal officials are seeking to make sure all students in meal programs will continue to get access.Even if schools close to minimize the spread of coronavirus, free and reduced lunch programs will be allowed to continue, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 22 million students receive free or reduced lunch.For the time being, the department, which manages nutrition programs, will allow schools to use formats used in summer months and also allow meals at places like libraries and churches, Politico reported.Typically, these meals need to be provided in a group setting, but that requirement can be waived. That's happened in Alaska, California, Kansas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington state, according to the USDA. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said, in general, those requests will continue to be granted for states. Who could be disruptedThe relief is being applied in low-income areas, Perdue said Tuesday, suggesting that other areas might be jeopardized. That's because of limitations in the law, he said.The low-income areas getting help are schools where 50% or more of students are eligible to receive free or reduced meals, according to a spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, of Maine, who questioned Perdue during a hearing.A California Education Department spokeswoman, Cynthia Butler, said schools can still get a federal waiver, regardless of the percentage threshold.Video: Coronavirus forces schools and universities to cancel classesBut to get access to off-site meals, the USDA would need additional authority from Congress, Pingree's spokeswoman, Victoria Bonney, said in a statement. (Technically, kids receiving free or reduced lunches in all areas are eligible to keep those meals, but families in rural areas may have difficulties getting to sites, Bonney said.)School administrators also are looking for ways to expand coverage to make sure all kids in needs can get access, according to Politico.Perdue said the federal government would love to be able to assist and will try to work for solutions.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 some schools are operating now given closuresIn Northern California, the Elk Grove school district canceled classes and activities from March 7 to March 13 after a family from the district was quarantined after testing positive for COVID-19.

From cruise ship to quarantine: Couple details life after leaving Grand Princess
.W
A couple is under quarantine after spending days stranded on the Grand Princess cruise ship.

A group of Iowans who traveled on the Grand Princess cruise ship is now in quarantine in San Antonio.Sheryl and Ray Sirdoreus, of Winterset, are among those under quarantine in Texas after exiting the ship."You go through an area that is a tent, and in that tent, they basically just ask you simple questions,” Sheryl Sirdoreus said. “‘Are you feeling OK? Do you feel like you have a fever?’ And they take your temperature, and then you're good to go."From there, Sheryl and Ray Sirdoreus took a police-escorted bus trip to a hangar with an unmarked plane."Everybody had not only masks, but they had the gloves and the full, clear face masks, as well, as they were all gowned up in the hazmat suits,” Sheryl Sirdoreus said.After a three-hour flight, the quarantined plane touched down at a new hangar with stations for the cruise ship travelers to fill out paperwork and get a meal.It was during supper that Sirdoreus said she, for a moment, didn’t feel so far away from home."We saw some people walk by, and this gentleman had on an Iowa Hawkeye coat, and we were like, ‘Oh, Iowa!’” she said. “So, they sat down with us and we chatted about the whole experience on the ship."Sheryl and Ray Sirdoreus will now spend two weeks quarantined in San Antonio.Though there is not much to do, Sirdoreus said she has one task on her list before coming back home to Iowa."I do not want to take a chance on infecting any of my customers when I get back home, so I do plan on getting tested," Sirdoreus said.The couple are under mandatory quarantine until March 24.

Here's what you should do if you already have the coronavirus
.W
What happens if you get the coronavirus? Keep calm, and follow these steps.

The coronavirus has swept across the globe, with at least 125,000 confirmed cases, and quickly climbing to 1,000 cases in the United States. As the virus spreads, preparation will give way to mitigation. If you have caught the coronavirus, or are worried you might be, here is a quick list from the Centers for Diease Control and Prevention of things to do if that happens.Limit contact with othersYou should avoid going to public places, riding public transit, or otherwise going out and about if you are sick or suspect you might be with the virus. Limit going out only for necessities or to see a doctor.Separate yourself from others in your household, including pets, as much as possible. Try to stay in a specific room, and use a specific bathroom for yourself if you have that option. Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels, or bedding. Avoid sharing food as well.Limit contact with pets if possibleThough there are no reports of animals becoming sick with COVID-19 from humans, it can be possible for the virus to stick to an animal's fur or face and then transmit later to another human host.If others cannot care for your pets, wash your hands before and after interacting with them.Cover your mouthIf you are sick or believe you might be, wear a face mask to limit spreading the virus. Wear your mask when visiting the doctor. Use a tissue to cover sneezing or coughing, and dispose it in a lined trashcan. Afterwards immediate wash your hands for a full 20 seconds with soap and warm water. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.Clean "high-touch" surfaces dailyClean and disinfect surfaces that are commonly touched like counter tops, desks, keyboards, doorknobs and phones.Disinfect areas that come into contact with bodily fluids, blood or stool. Toilets, sinks, showers and other surfaces in bathrooms should be cleaned and disinfected.Call your doctor before visitingEven if you already had an unrelated medical appointment and wanted to bring it up, call your doctor and tell them you may or may not have COVID-19. This will allow the healthcare provider to prepare for your visit and take steps to keep others from being exposed.Keep on top of your symptomsIf you have a medical emergency, call 911. Inform them you have or may have COVID-19. If possible, wear a face mask before emergency services arrive.Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you notice your symptoms worsening (such as difficulty breathing.) Be sure to inform your doctor you are coming, and wear your face mask.Ask your healthcare provider to inform the local or state health department. Persons who are placed under self-monitoring should follow all instructions by their local health department or health professionals, as appropriate.Discontinue home isolation when appropriateThose confirmed with coronavirus should remain isolated in their homes until their risk of secondary transmission is believed to be low. The decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider as well as state and local health departments. Do not make the decision to discontinue self-isolation without having spoken to a healthcare professional, even if you feel better. It is still possible to pass the virus on to others.

If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.                                                                                                       How long should you wash your hands to avoid the coronavirus? Sing the chorus to any of these songs                          Clean "high-touch" surfaces daily Clean and disinfect surfaces that are commonly touched like counter tops, desks, keyboards, doorknobs and phones. Disinfect areas that come into contact with bodily fluids, blood or stool. Toilets, sinks, showers and other surfaces in bathrooms should be cleaned and disinfected. Call your doctor before visiting Even if you already had an unrelated medical appointment and wanted to bring it up, call your doctor and tell them you may or may not have COVID-19. This will allow the healthcare provider to prepare for your visit and take steps to keep others from being exposed. Keep on top of your symptoms If you have a medical emergency, call 911. Inform them you have or may have COVID-19. If possible, wear a face mask before emergency services arrive. Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you notice your symptoms worsening (such as difficulty breathing.) Be sure to inform your doctor you are coming, and wear your face mask. Ask your healthcare provider to inform the local or state health department. Persons who are placed under self-monitoring should follow all instructions by their local health department or health professionals, as appropriate. Discontinue home isolation when appropriate Those confirmed with coronavirus should remain isolated in their homes until their risk of secondary transmission is believed to be low. The decision should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider as well as state and local health departments. Do not make the decision to discontinue self-isolation without having spoken to a healthcare professional, even if you feel better. It is still possible to pass the virus on to others.

Rossen Reports exclusive: Carnival Cruises, Ford purchase new technology to fight coronavirus spread

Major American companies are beginning to buy up these infrared cameras by the thousands

One method for containing the spread of the novel coronavirus: highly calibrated infrared cameras. Major American companies are beginning to buy them up by the thousands. These high-tech cameras contain ultra-sensitive sensors that come either as a portable device or fixed cameras that attach to metal detectors. They passively take a person’s temperature to determine in real-time if they have a fever. These devices are already being used in airports around the world, including in China and Mexico. Just this week, we have learned exclusively, Carnival Cruise Line ordered the cameras to test passengers and crew boarding its ships. Ford Motor Company also bought the devices to test and protect employees at its plants around the world.Full-body temperature scanners aren’t yet approved for airports in the U.S. But companies that manufacture the devices are working closely with the U.S. government to speed up the process, hoping to get on the front lines of protecting the public from COVID-19.We met with Gary Strahan, CEO of Infrared Cameras, to see how these devices work. Watch the video above to see it in action.                        One method for containing the spread of the novel coronavirus: highly calibrated infrared cameras.

Pelosi says agreement near with White House on virus aid
.W
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced late Thursday that she and the Trump administration are close to an agreement on a coronavirus aid package.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced late Thursday that she and the Trump administration are close to an agreement on a coronavirus aid package as negotiators struggled to hammer out a deal to provide funding and resources for American workers, families and businesses reeling from health and financial problems from the crisis.Final details are being worked out, but Pelosi expected an announcement Friday. The House could swiftly vote.“We have — are near-to — an agreement,” Pelosi said, emerging from her office at the Capitol shortly before 9 p.m. after a long day of many crosstown phone calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnunchin, who was tapped by the White House to lead the talks.The sudden announcement was aimed as a confidence booster, Democrats said, on an otherwise tumultuous day as Washington strained for a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak that is testing the nation's political, financial and health care systems.As President Donald Trump restricted air travel from Europe, Congress struggled with the aid package and the seats of power closed down to visitors.The centerpiece of Trump's response, a monthlong restriction on travel from most of Europe, was set to begin at midnight Friday night. Trump blamed Europe for not acting quickly enough.Meanwhile, the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court all declared themselves off-limits to the public for now, symbols of a nation hunkering down.Democrat Joe Biden, Trump's chief rival for the White House, challenged him for playing down the threat for weeks and promised if he becomes president to "always tell you the truth.”As closures, cancellations and fears confronted so many aspects of daily American life, the coronavirus question, for Trump and members of Congress, was becoming personal.Just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the communications chief for Brazil's president, Fábio Wajngarten, tested positive for the coronavirus. A photo of President Trump, the senator and Wajngarten shows the trio shoulder to shoulder at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend.It was the first time someone infected with the virus was known to have been in close proximity to the president.Scott said he was isolating himself. Trump, 73, said he was unworried.“We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time.” Asked whether he should be tested, Trump replied, “I am not concerned.”The White House did not respond to questions about whether the president and his senior staff are being tested for the virus and whether any were considering self-quarantining. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was also at Trump’s club on the weekend, joined a growing list of lawmakers who have chosen to isolate themselves as a precaution. Most are doing so after interactions elsewhere.The president also said Thursday that he was considering major restrictions, such as limiting travel to domestic hot spots like California and Washington state, without spelling out how he would manage such an extraordinary effort. The State Department issued a global health advisory cautioning U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel abroad” due to the virus and associated quarantines and restrictions.So far, the administration's haphazard response and the stalemate in Congress have resulted in more uncertainty as the crisis roils the financial markets and rewrites daily life for Americans.Biden and Bernie Sanders, the other main contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered their own speeches the day after Trump's prime-time address to the nation.Biden called for free virus testing, temporary pop-up hospitals and paid leave for all Americans to help cover paychecks as workers self-quarantine, care for the ill or lose jobs over the virus.“No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this: When I’m president we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,” Biden declared.Sanders, speaking in Vermont, also sought swift federal intervention and money to help people suffering in their health or finances.Congress was about to break for the week, leaving uncertain the hopes for swift passage of a multibillion-dollar aid package that was compiled in Pelosi's House but stalled by opposition from Republicans.Trump said he would not support the measure “because there are things in there that have nothing to do with what we're talking about.”The bill would build on last week's $8.3 billion emergency coronavirus measure and provide free testing, a new federal sick pay program, more unemployment insurance and food aid for workers and other Americans hit by the crisis. Although major insurers have agreed to provide diagnostic tests at no cost to their customers, about 28 million people have no insurance.As talks continued, lawmakers from both parties expressed alarm after what they called heated and testy briefings with Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, and other public health officials. Lawmakers were particularly frustrated that U.S. officials have tested relatively few patients.“We’re basically, in my opinion, flying blind," said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev.As classes, sports events, concerts and conferences are canceled across the nation, Trump said he would be halting his signature campaign rallies, telling reporters he needs a “little separation until such time as this goes away.” His rivals, Biden and Sanders, said they would no longer hold large political gatherings and their staffs would work from home as the race for the presidency moved online.The three branches of government closed their doors to visitors — Congress shut the Capitol to the public until April, White House tours have been suspended and the Supreme Court will also turn back visitors.The storied Smithsonian said it was canceling all public events and will temporarily close its network of museums and the National Zoo, starting Saturday. And Trump proposed postponing this summer’s Olympics in Japan for a year, too.The financial markets endured another day of alarming slides, and the Federal Reserve moved to try to ease the disruptions by announcing that it will sharply increase its purchases of short-term Treasury bonds.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it.While Trump said all European travel except from Britain would be cut off, there were clarifications and criticisms of the cornerstone of his attempt to curtail the crisis.Homeland Security officials said the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area at any point in the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area encompasses most European countries, among them France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Austria and Belgium.The restrictions don't apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others identified in the proclamation signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is also asking travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days.But some health officials, and even a former high-ranking Trump administration official, suggested that Trump's European travel restriction was futile because the virus is already widespread on U.S. soil.“In two weeks, we will regret wasting time and energy on travel restrictions and wish we focused more on hospital preparation and large scale community mitigation," Trump's former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, tweeted Thursday.Trump claimed falsely Thursday that the U.S. is currently screening all Americans and foreigners who are entering the country, saying, “people coming in have to be tested." And he claimed that those who return are being forced to isolate themselves, adding, “It's going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine."

'I was careless': NBA player apologizes for coronavirus prank

The first NBA player to test positive for coronavirus is being criticized for a prank he pulled on members of the media as it could put them theoretically at risk of contracting the illness.

The first NBA player to test positive for coronavirus is being criticized for a prank he pulled on members of the media as it could put them theoretically at risk of contracting the illness.As he was leaving a media event on Monday, All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz touched every microphone and recorder in front of him in jest.Gobert, who subsequently tested positive for coronavirus, released a public apology on Instagram on Thursday."I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis ... mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment," wrote Gobert."The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected. I was careless and make no excuse." One member of the media who was present when Gobert made the joke later tweeted that he thought the act was "a measure of support for the media."Andy Larsen of the Salt Lake Tribune tweeted: "On the Rudy Gobert microphone incident: at the time, I actually took it as a measure of support for the media."We were being told to keep 6-8 feet away from them on the assumption that we might infect a player. I thought it was Rudy thumbing his nose at the separation between us."It was obviously reckless, but heck, nearly everyone I know has made a coronavirus distance joke at some point this week."Before Wednesday's Jazz game, the team announced that Gobert would not play in the game because of an illness.As the game was about to get underway, the team received test results that a player tested positive for coronavirus and the game was canceled.Following Gobert's positive test, the NBA suspended the regular season until further notice.The Jazz later released a statement saying: "A preliminary positive result came back right before tip-off of the Utah Jazz-Oklahoma City game."Subsequently, the decision was correctly made by the NBA to postpone the game."When it was determined that the individual would be tested, we immediately informed the league office."The health and safety of our players, our organization, those throughout our league, and all those potentially impacted by this situation are paramount in our discussions."We are working closely with the CDC, Oklahoma and Utah state officials and the NBA to determine how to best move forward as we gather more information."The individual is currently in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City."In coordination with the NBA and state officials, we will provide updates at the appropriate time."Evan Fournier, a guard with the Orlando Magic and a friend of Gobert tweeted out that he has been in touch with the Utah Jazz star. "He is doing good man. Lets not panick (sic) everyone. Love you all."Meanwhile Utah Jazz player Donovan Mitchell has acknowledged that he tested positive for coronavirus.Mitchell posted the news on his Instagram account."We are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them," wrote Mitchell.

Worried about your job amid the coronavirus outbreak? Here's what to know
.W
Workers in the service industry are already feeling the heat as people opt to stay home to lessen their chances of getting sick.

As the coronavirus outbreak spreads, the number of event cancellations, business closures and work-from-home directives are increasing. But what if your job doesn't allow working from home? Workers in the service industry are already feeling the heat as people opt to stay home to lessen their chances of getting sick. Ubah Dahran, a ride-sharing driver in Washington state, told KCPQ that in one day, she made less than $15. "It's very tough for me," she said.

"I have no fear from the coronavirus because of what I have back home. I have no food on the table. I have no money to pay rent," he told KCPQ. "I made $18.17 in a whole day."

"And I cannot sit at home, I mean because I have four kids. I have to feed my kids."  The U.S. Department of Labor has announced new guidance for unemployment insurance flexibilities during the coronavirus outbreak. If employees are laid off and didn't receive their last paycheck, immediate payment may be required by state law, but is not federally mandated.Federal law does not require employers who are unable to provide work to pay employees for hours they would have worked if the outbreak weren't ongoing. The new guidance under federal law, does however, allow states to pay unemployment benefits in states where the following has occurred: • employers temporarily stops operations due to the coronavirus, preventing workers from coming to work. • employees are quarantined and expected to return to work after the quarantine is over.• an employee leaves work due to risk of exposure or infection, or to care for a family member. Affected employees should contact their state labor office for clarification and to ask about specific benefits available to them. Financial planners are advising people to prepare their bank accounts for the effects of the coronavirus. Ryan Marshall, a financial planner based in New Jersey, told CNBC that it could be wise to pause on investing and keep money in a safer place like a savings account. Shawn Melby, a Nashville-based financial planner, told CNBC it's smart to build up an emergency savings account with 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses in case of an unexpected layoff. When it comes to sacrifices, Melby said halting recurring subscriptions and memberships is a good place to start. For anyone hoping to extend a helpful hand to others facing layoffs or a reduction in hours due to the coronavirus, there are a couple options. Here are a few: • Feed America. This is a national organization that assists a network of food banks, soup kitchens, shelters and other community agencies.• Meals on Wheels. Because seniors are more vulnerable to the coronavirus, the need to deliver food to the elderly is more important now than ever before. • Your local homeless shelter.

Although many blood drives have been and will be cancelled, the American Red Cross said healthy individuals can schedule a time to donate at their local Red Cross, Esquire reports.

Viral social media posts offer false coronavirus tips
.W
Posts are circulating false and misleading tips on social media — in some cases wrongly attributed to Stanford University — about how people can monitor and avoid the coronavirus.

Posted on March 12, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.As the U.S. and countries around the world work to address the pandemic spread of COVID-19, posts disseminated by tens of thousands on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are feeding misinformation to people about how to avoid and self-test for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The posts provide a series of supposed tips about the virus, such as wrongly instructing people to hold their breath to gauge whether they’ve been infected and falsely suggesting that water consumption can kill the virus. Similar claims were promoted in a text-based image posted on the Instagram account of actress Debra Messing, which has since been deleted. They were also shared widely in screenshots on Twitter.The posts in some cases cite “Taiwan experts” or “Japanese doctors,” and many begin by falsely sourcing the text to “STANFORD HOSPITAL BOARD.” Stanford Health Care has debunked that attribution. We consulted Krys Johnson, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, who called the posts “deeply troubling because they make incorrect and dangerous claims.” She recommended people consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World Health Organization, before spreading purported health advice.Here are some of the claims from the posts, and why they’re inaccurate:Claim: “Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.”Facts: There’s no evidence to suggest this is a valid test for COVID-19. What’s more: “We know that people infected with coronavirus show symptoms within 14 days and that this virus can lead to severe complications,” Johnson told us via email, “but those are acute respiratory distress (not being able to breathe) and septic shock (the virus infecting your bloodstream), not fibrosis, as mentioned here.”The CDC recommends seeking medical advice by phone if you develop the main symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and shortness of breath — and have been in contact with someone who has the disease, or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a spread of the virus.Claim: “If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold … Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.”Facts: While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are “fever, tiredness, and dry cough,” according to WHO, some patients do have “aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.” Some who are infected don’t show any symptoms. Also, a WHO report said that, based on an examination of more than 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 33% had sputum (phlegm) production.Claim: “Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus.”Facts: The WHO has shot down this theory, saying that, “hile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.”Likewise, Johnson said that the “moistness of your mouth and throat have nothing to do with the likelihood that you will develop disease, and simply drinking water to ‘rinse’ your digestive track will not prevent you from being infected or from getting sick.” Water consumption, she added, “has no bearing on the virus getting into your airways and lungs; if you breathe in an infected person’s respiratory droplets, the virus will travel through your airways.”CDC officials recommend people clean their hands often, for at least 20 seconds — or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as an alternative — and avoid touching their faces and mouths. They also suggest social distancing, which can help curb the spread of the virus.Claim: “This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees.”Facts: What, exactly, these posts are referencing is unclear. The CDC has said it’s “not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.” We’ve previously written about how it’s unknown whether warming weather will help temper the outbreak.The WHO has said there is “no reason to believe that this virus would behave differently in different temperatures.” Johnson noted that Italy “has a particularly mild winter and they have had widespread transmission of COVID-19, so it is unlikely that the outside temperature will affect this disease.”More than 125,000 people across the globe have been infected by the coronavirus, leading to more than 4,700 deaths.

6,000 passengers being held on cruise ship in Italy as couple is tested for coronavirus

A 54-year-old woman and her husband from Hong Kong being tested are in solitary confinement in the hospital section of the cruise ship.

Thousands of people are being kept on a cruise ship in Italy as one passenger shows symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus, while Russia is shutting its border with China to stem the spread of the outbreak.The number of cases of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan has shot up by 30% in just a day to more than 7,700 on the country's mainland.Elsewhere, more than 100 people have been infected in 20 countries or territories across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Most concerning, instances of human-to-human transmission have been reported overseas, including in Germany, the first such case in Europe.A spokesperson for Costa Cruises told CNN that a 54-year-old woman was showing symptoms of the virus, namely a fever."All the other passengers are, at the moment remaining on board," the spokesperson said.  Italian news agency ANSA and public broadcaster RAI reported that the woman and her husband were from Hong Kong and were being kept separately in solitary confinement in the hospital section of the Costa Smeralda cruiseliner. The couple will be held until they both test negative to the virus.Images show the ship docked at Civitavecchia port, a coastal town northwest of Rome, after arriving from Palma de Majorca, Spain.The couple are expected to receive their results Thursday afternoon, ANSA reports. They are said to have arrived in Italy on Jan. 25 at Milan's Malpensa airport from Macau.Meanwhile, Russian state media reported Thursday that Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin had signed an order to close Russia's border with China in the Far East in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus."An order has been signed today, it is in the works. Today we will inform everyone accordingly about the relevant measures to close the border in the Far Eastern region and other measures that have been taken by the government," Mishustin said, RIA reports.The number of confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus continues to grow worldwide, as the city at the heart of the outbreak marks a week since it was first placed under lockdown.All 31 provinces and regions within China have now reported confirmed cases of the virus, including Tibet, which had instituted strict checks on travelers and shut down tourist sites in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stop its spread to the region.India confirmed its first case on Thursday of a student who had studied in Wuhan.The continued rise in the number of infections comes as multiple countries evacuate their citizens from Wuhan.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday ordered the People's Liberation Army to aid in "winning the battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic." Military medical teams have already been sent to Wuhan and soldiers are also aiding with transporting supplies to the stricken city.The World Health Organization (WHO) will meet again on Thursday to decide whether to declare the virus a global health emergency, something it has so far refrained from doing, despite widespread criticism.Quarantine cityIn Wuhan itself, 11 million people are marking a week on lockdown with no sign of immediate relief. Nor is there firm evidence that their sacrifice has been worth it, with the virus spreading around the country and scientists warning that other major cities could soon become self-sustaining epidemics.Online, people trapped in their houses have been uploading videos and photos showing various ways they are staying busy -- staging makeshift Lunar New Year lion dances in their apartments, exercising, and urging others to keep their spirits up. But as the lockdown stretches on, such positivity may be harder to come by, particularly as some begin to feel the lost wages or business.At the same time, foreigners in Wuhan are increasingly being airlifted out of the city. Multiple countries, including Japan, the US, South Korea, New Zealand, Canada and Australia have begun flying their citizens home -- though all will face an extended quarantine once they arrive.Those planes may soon have a lot more sky to themselves, as multiple major carriers have announced they are canceling flights to and from parts of China, including British Airways, American Airlines, Air Canada, KLM, Lufthansa and United. The moves follow travel guidance from multiple governments advising against "nonessential" travel to the country.Across Asia and elsewhere, strict checks and screening have been put in place for all travelers arriving from China -- though this may be ineffective as scientists previously warned that the virus can be spread while patients are asymptomatic.Papua New Guinea said it will refuse entry to travelers coming from "any Asian ports," while the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong has introduced new limits it says will cut the amount of mainland Chinese travelers coming to the city by 80%.Is it enough?Across China, the Lunar New Year holiday has been extended to next week, a potentially huge economic hit for a country already feeling the pain of the U.S.-China trade war.Some 60 million people across Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, are on some level of lockdown, and many travelers from the region have been ordered to self-quarantine, holed up in their apartments or hotel rooms for days on end.While "Come on Wuhan!" has been a popular refrain online, and the country has largely pulled together to tackle the outbreak, there have also been reports of discrimination against Hubei residents, with them denied accommodation or entry to restaurants in other parts of the country.As the country prepares to get back to work next week, there's also the looming question of whether enough has been done. While the Wuhan lockdown may have stopped the even greater spread of the virus, it was too late to prevent it reaching every part of the country.Outside of Hubei, infections are predicted to continue growing for weeks, if not months. Researchers at Imperial College London have estimated that at least 4,000 people were infected in Wuhan by January 18, almost a week before the lockdown began. Their model suggests a low national figure of 20,000 infections by the end of the month, potentially as high as 100,000.Speaking to state media Tuesday, Zhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the peak to come in up to 10 days."It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases," Zhong said.

World Health Organization declares coronavirus a 'public health emergency of international concern'
.W
The organization defines a public health emergency of international concern as "an extraordinary event" that constitutes a "public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease."

The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, after an emergency committee reconvened Thursday in Geneva.Last week, the organization said the virus did not yet constitute the emergency declaration.

"On the contrary, WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak."                        The World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, after an emergency committee reconvened Thursday in Geneva. Last week, the organization said the virus did not yet constitute the emergency declaration.

Social media is ablaze with concern over whether the 98-year-old actress is healthy during the coronavirus outbreak.

If you were worried about Betty White's health condition during the coronavirus outbreak, thank you for being a friend, she says she's fine.Social media went crazy over whether the 98-year-old was protected, especially considering the virus is more severe for the elderly. Panic about White's condition ensued after Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, announced that they had contracted the virus in Australia. A representative for White told TODAY Thursday that "Betty is fine."

Cities across the US hope to slow coronavirus cases by 'flattening the curve'
.W
The goal is to flatten the number of infections, or lower the curve, so they don’t exceed the capacity of health care providers to deal with them.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, cities across the U.S. are trying to “flatten the curve.”This is the goal of social distancing and other measures, such as canceling larger events and calling off in-person classes at universities in favor of online learning.In cities like Pittsburgh, officials have made the case to flatten the spike of infections if and when they do come."If the amount of infections spike, what’s a known fact is that those resources are finite, and there’s only so many ventilators, beds and doctors," Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said. "And we don’t want to overwhelm those systems, even in a medical community like Pittsburgh is."The goal is to flatten the number of infections, or lower the curve, so they don’t exceed the capacity of health care providers to deal with them."It’s like stopping a pack of matches from lighting by separating the other half from the first three that are firing off," Fetterman said.Watch the video above to see the full story.

A Seattle woman who says she had the coronavirus and is recovering has one "big takeaway" to share: Don't panic.

A Seattle woman who says she had the coronavirus and is recovering has one "big takeaway" to share: Don't panic.Elizabeth Schneider, 37, believes she contracted the virus at a house party because a few days later, several friends who were at the party became ill at the same time she did.Three days after the Feb. 22 party, Schneider says, she was at work when she started feeling unwell.She was "feeling tired, body aches, getting a headache, feeling a little bit feverish," so she decided to go home, Schneider told CNN's Erin Burnett.She woke up from a nap with a 101 degree fever, and "by the time I went to bed, it had soared to 103 degrees," Schneider said.Schneider said she thought she had a nasty flu. It didn't occur to her that it could be the coronavirus because the symptoms didn't fit -- she didn't have a cough, no shortness of breath, no respiratory symptoms at all.The "aha" moment didn't come until she found out that about a dozen friends who'd been to the same party got sick "at the exact same day, roughly around the same time in the evening, with very similar symptoms."The Seattle area is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Of the 1,635 cases reported in the country since the COVID-19 first appeared in January, 457 of them are in Washington, including 41 deaths. Still, Schneider and her friends weren't tested for the coronavirus, she said. Their doctors thought they had the flu, but the flu tests were negative."At this point, we were all getting a little frustrated that they weren't allowed to be tested for coronavirus, or the doctor wasn't even suggesting" they be tested for it, Schneider said.So, one of her friends told her about a Seattle flu study. Participants sign up online and send in a nasal swab from a kit that's part of the study. Recently, she said, they started testing for coronavirus, too, and "that's how I ultimately found out."Schneider said she recovered after staying home, resting and taking over-the-counter medications."I think the big takeaway I want to tell everyone is: Please don't panic," Schneider said. "If you are healthy, if you are younger, if you take good care of yourself when you're sick, you will recover, I believe. And I'm living proof of that."Schneider, though, had age and otherwise good health on her side. For the elderly or people with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, COVID-19 can be -- and has been -- deadly, health officials say."The grim reality is that, for the elderly, COVID-19 is almost a perfect killing machine," American Health Care Association President Mark Parkinson told CNN this week.Some states are restricting visits to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in an effort to stem the spread of the disease to that vulnerable population.

Protecting residents from a deadly threat, nursing homes must decide who gets in and who stays out
.W
Roughly 2.5 million Americans live in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. They are in serious danger.

On Tuesday, at Aldercrest Health and Rehabilitation Center, they were disinfecting the saltshakers. The front door was locked. Somewhere outside, a new virus proliferated. It had killed at least 24 people in Washington state, at least 19 at the Life Care Center across the lake.Visitors had to ring the bell. A nurse wore gloves and held a thermometer. Anyone above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit would be turned away.It is a frightening time in America. People have questions about the novel coronavirus. Can they get it from paper money or the swimming pool? Can they kill it with lemons and vinegar? Should they put their gloves in the freezer? "What do I do if I contract the coronavirus and I'm uninsured," someone wrote to CNN. "Am I as good as dead?"This much is certain: The older and sicker you already are, the more likely it is to kill you. Roughly 2.5 million Americans live in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. They are in serious danger.The COVID-19 virus can give a person fever, dry cough, labored breathing. It can also infect you while causing none of those symptoms, which means you might walk around for days as an unwitting carrier. With one sneeze, you could put your grandmother in peril.All this has put enormous pressure on the people who operate the nation's nursing homes. It is their job to keep the frail and the elderly alive. Now, in some cases, that means keeping them away from the ones they love.The Department of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday banned visitors from its nursing homes. A group that represents 13,000 nursing sites around the country suggested they all do the same. For the elderly, its director said, "COVID-19 is almost a perfect killing machine."The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society, one of the nation's largest senior-housing providers, also halted visits, with rare exceptions. At its facility in Blaine, Washington, about 110 miles north of Seattle, administrator Haley Amundson said employees were cleaning door handles and water fountains up to three times a day.Amundson is only 26, and in a phone interview she recalled volunteering in nursing homes as a child. Now, she has been avoiding public events, washing her hands frequently, doing whatever she can to evade the coronavirus. Families had been notified of the new policy, and Amundson said they understood, although she felt sorry for one particular resident who would probably miss having lunch with his wife."It's quieter," she said of the facility, which is licensed for 57 residents. They tried to stay at least 6 feet apart while playing bingo. Some stayed in their rooms and strained to hear the activities assistant calling out the numbers.'To just wholesale lock people out doesn't make any sense'Across the country in New York, at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, executive director Richard Mollot read the latest news with a skeptical eye. That was part of his job. He didn't see why nursing homes had to ban visitors. After all, it wasn't a true quarantine. Workers came and went all the time, subject to questions and temperature readings and so forth, and he thought visitors should be allowed to do the same."To just wholesale lock people out doesn't make any sense," he said, because residents would miss their loved ones and would need their outside personal-care assistants and would get better care if workers knew that someone was checking on them.On an issue like this one, reasonable people could disagree. Mollot worried that nursing homes were becoming more like prisons.The worst-case scenario is fresh in the collective memory. Someone brought the coronavirus into the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, and it spread, and people were dying, and their loved ones could not reach them. On March 1, Bonnie Holstad stood outside, holding a handwritten sign:"My husband is a patientKen Holstad Rm 50No one at Life Care is answering the phones. I cannot reach the nursing stations. He now has a cough. He has Parkinson's with dementia. I am his advocate. He needs to be attended to...what is his temperature? Can he be tested for Covid 19?"Pat Herrick found out about the quarantine at Life Care Center and called her mother, Elaine, who said her roommate was coughing."I don't know when I'm gonna get to see you again," her mother said on the phone. That was their last conversation before her mother died.Despite the restrictions, Kim Frey found a way in. Afraid that her 89-year-old mother would die alone, she stood outside the window, holding a sign that said something like, "We can't come in, but Jesus can." A staff member saw her outside and let her in, Frey told the Seattle Times.She wore a mask and visited her mother. But later she began to wonder whether she should have stayed away. If the coronavirus could go into a nursing home, it could also come out."We did just find out that my brother tested positive," she said March 4 on CNN. "My sister is very sick. I have another brother that was sick."On Wednesday in New Rochelle, New York, the National Guard worked to contain what appeared to be the largest cluster of coronavirus cases in the nation. Not far from the containment area, nearly 500 residents went about their business at the nursing home and assisted-living pavilions of United Hebrew of New Rochelle."We're ready for this," said Rita Mabli, the president and CEO.The governor had banned visitors, but workers were helping residents use iPads to Skype or FaceTime with loved ones. Residents played bridge or poker. A therapist played the guitar.Gloria Selden, age 91, kept a bottle of Purell in her apartment. She had recently heard about the coronavirus on MSNBC, but her friends weren't talking about it much. They preferred to talk about politics.Then again, she did understand the risks. Last week, before the ban took effect, her daughter planned to visit from Manhattan.She would have taken the train.She would have taken a taxi.Selden thought about it, and told her to stay away.

Louisiana primary postponed over COVID-19 concerns

More than half of Election Day polling commissioners are 65 and older, the age group most at risk during the coronavirus outbreak across the country.

Louisiana will be the first state in the country to postpone its elections because of concerns over the coronavirus.The Louisiana presidential primary was scheduled for April 4. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said he is requesting Gov. John Bel Edwards issue an executive order to postpone the elections until June and July.The April 4 primary will now take place June 20 Ardoin announced.The secretary of state said the decision to postpone elections was made after he deemed a state of emergency exists in Louisiana because of coronavirus concerns.The previous times elections have been delayed in Louisiana were for hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and hurricanes Gustave and Ike in 2008."This weighty decision has been made out of abundance of caution for Louisiana's voters, voting officials and Louisiana as a whole," Ardoin said.Ardoin said the delay will help prevent the spread of COVID-19. He added that the decision was clear when he took into account that more than half of Election Day polling commissioners are 65 and older, the age group most at risk during the coronavirus outbreak across the country.Also, polling locations in Louisiana are found at nursing homes, senior centers and other locations where seniors frequent.The next round of presidential primaries in the country are scheduled for Tuesday. Residents in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio are also set to head to the polls. Election officials in those states have not made postponement decisions.             BATON ROUGE, La.

The EPA is arming consumers with a list of disinfectants that people can use to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is arming consumers with a list of disinfectants that people can use to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus.The federal agency released a five-page list of chemicals and products Thursday that it says are strong enough to ward off "harder-to-kill" viruses than SARS-CoV-2, the virus that's responsible for the disease."Using the correct disinfectant is an important part of preventing and reducing the spread of illnesses along with other critical aspects such as hand washing," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement."There is no higher priority for the Trump Administration than protecting the health and safety of Americans. EPA is providing this important information in a public and transparent manner on disinfectant products to help reduce the spread of COVID-19," he said.The EPA says it's best to follow the instructions on the disinfectant's label and pay attention to the how long the product should be on the surface you're cleaning.In a statement to CNN, the EPA said companies can apply for an "emerging pathogens claim" based on previously approved claims for harder-to-kill viruses. The agency reviews them and determines whether the company can safely make that claim.One important fact to note, however: Handwashing with soap and water is still the best way to prevent transmission of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That's because from what we know so far, the novel coronavirus is thought to spread primarily by people and their respiratory droplets — think coughs, sneezes, spit.In other words, person-to-person transmission is most common.While it's possible that people who touch surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touch their mouths or eyes can also become infected, this may not be the main way the virus spreads, the CDC said.

First Kansas COVID-19 death linked to care facility in Seattle where more than 20 died from virus
.W
More than 30 deaths linked to Washington care center.

Officials continue to investigate how a man at a Wyandotte County, Kansas, long-term care facility contracted COVID-19 and died earlier this week.The man, who was in his 70s, lived at the Life Care Center of Kansas City off 61st Street in Kansas City, Kansas, officials say. Gov. Laura Kelly said Sunday the man was taken to Providence Medical Center in KCK for what was believed to be cardiac issues.Dr. Lee Norman, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said that during the man's treatment, health care providers made the decision to administer a test for the coronavirus because the man had a fever. The testing was done postmortem, and the test came back positive for the coronavirus.The man was bed-bound at the facility. Health officials said this makes his case the first "community case" of COVID-19, meaning it was spread to him; he did not contract the virus in a foreign country or another state."As a skilled nursing facility resident, and one who is not mobile really, he had to have gotten it from someplace. So by definition, it was in the community," Norman said.Health officials are now working to determine who may have had contact with the man. KMBC 9, our sister station in Kansas City, has learned the Life Care Center facility where the man was living is owned by the same company as the Life Care facility where multiple fatalities have been reported in Seattle. The facility released a statement and a timeline involving the patient who died:"We have begun notifying our families, residents and associates as of this report."HIPAA privacy guidelines prevent the sharing of personal patient information. With that, here is an outline of all the information we are able to share regarding this situation: The patient began their stay when they were discharged to Life Care Center of Kansas City from Providence Health Center on Feb. 25.On Saturday, March 7, the patient was transferred to a local hospital to receive care for a medical issue entirely unrelated to symptoms or signs of COVID-19. The patient was treated in the emergency room and released by the hospital back to our facility on the same day. On Tuesday, March 10, the patient became unresponsive in our facility. We called 911, and the patient was transferred to the hospital. The patient did not exhibit signs or symptoms of respiratory illness when discharged to the hospital.On Wednesday, March 11, the patient passed away in the hospital.At 4:30 p.m. on March 12, we received notification from the health department that apost-mortem test was conducted showing the patient as positive for COVID-19.We immediately isolated any patient who had known contact with the patient.As of today, Friday, March 13, we have no other patients or staff who are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19."Prior to this incident and continuing now, we have been following all CMS, CDC and state and local health department guidelines concerning COVID-19. Our associates are being diligent on practicing proper hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment, which is recurring education they normally receive, beginning with their orientation at our facility. Every associate is also screened when they arrive for work, including checking temperature, to ensure no additional sickness is brought into our building. If they have a fever over 100.4, we send them home and ask they contact their personal physician."Providence Medical Center released a statement that read in part:"Our hospital has identified the staff who came into contact with the patient while providing care and is following all guidelines regarding healthcare work exposure."We extend our deepest condolences to the patient’s family. At this time, our top priority remains protecting public health and ensuring the safety of our patients, visitors, staff, physicians, volunteers, and community."             KANSAS CITY, Kan.

NBA players are giving their money to support arena workers affected by coronavirus
.W
NBA stars like Kevin Love and Zion Williamson are making huge donations to help arena workers whose jobs were sent into limbo by the coronavirus.

The coronavirus has shut down practically all major U.S. sports and by extension the arenas they are played in. While for most people, that means missing out on their favorite sports, for many, it means their jobs are in limbo and paychecks they rely on are gone. Several athletes have pledged donations to support the various workers in arenas they call home.Kevin Love announced via Instagram he would be donating $100,000 to assist staff of the Cleveland Cavaliers arena. "I hope that during this time of crisis, others will join me in supporting our communities," Love wrote in his post.And join him others did. Blake Griffin, of the Detroit Pistons matched Love by donating $100,000 to the Little Caesars arena workers. Love congratulated his altruism in a tweet.Giannis Antetokounmpo, of the Milwaukee Bucks, again matched Love's donation, giving $100,000 to the staff of the Fiserv Forum arena."We can get through this together!" Antetokounmpo wrote on Twitter.Zion Williamson, of the New Orleans Pelicans, made a pledge to cover the salaries for every worker at the Pelicans' arena for 30 days."These are the folks who make our games possible, creating the perfect environment for our fans and everyone involved in the organization," Williamson wrote. "Unfortunately, many of them are still recovering from long term challenges created by Katrina, and now face the economic impact of the postponement of games because of the virus."

And the fear and anxiety resulting from the recent outbreak of COVID-19 can be extremely overwhelming.  Through the game of basketball, we've been able to address major issues and stand together as a progressive league that cares about the players, the fans, and the communities where we work. I'm concerned about the level of anxiety that everyone is feeling and that is why I'm committing $100,000 through the @KevinLoveFund in support of the @Cavs arena and support staff that had a sudden life shift due to the suspension of the NBA season. I hope that during this time of crisis, others will join me in supporting our communities. Pandemics are not just a medical phenomenon. They affect individuals and society on so many levels, with stigma and xenophobia being just two aspects of the impact of a pandemic outbreak. It's important to know that those with a mental illness may be vulnerable to the effects of widespread panic and threat. Be kind to one another. Be understanding of their fears, regardless if you don't feel the same. Be safe and make informed decisions during this time. And I encourage everyone to take care of themselves and to reach out to others in need -- whether that means supporting your local charities that are canceling events, or checking in on your colleagues and family.

View this post on Instagram                       The people of New Orleans have been incredibly welcoming and supportive since I was Drafted by the Pels last June, and some of the most special people I have met are those who work at smoothie King Center. These are the folks who make our games possible, creating the perfect environment for our fans and everyone involved in the organization. Unfortunately, many of them are still recovering from long term challenges created by Katrina, and now face the economic impact of the postponement of games because of the virus. My mother has always set an example for me about being respectful for others and being grateful for what we have, and so today I am pledging to cover the salaries for all of those Smoothie King Center workers for the next 30 days. This is a small way for me to express my support and appreciation for these wonderful people who have been so great to me and my teammates and hopefully we can all join together to relieve some of the stress and hardship caused by this national health crisis. This is an incredibly resilient city full of some of the most resilient people, but sometimes providing a little extra assistance can make things a little easier for the community.

House passes coronavirus relief bill after President Trump announces his support
.W
The bill passed with broad, bipartisan support early hours Saturday following intense negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration.

The House of Representatives passed a bipartisan legislative package in response to the spread of coronavirus in the early hours of Saturday morning following intense negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration.The bill passed with broad, bipartisan support and a final tally of 363-40 with 40 Republicans voting against it and Independent Justin Amash of Michigan voting "present."Late in the day on Friday, President Trump Donald tweeted his support for the measure that includes provisions for paid emergency leave and free testing for COVID-19, after Pelosi announced that Democrats had struck a deal with the administration.Trump's backing cleared the way for a broad, bipartisan vote in the House with the Senate expected to take up the measure when it returns to session next week.In a series of tweets, the President said, "I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening.""This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers. I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!"The announcement from the President put an end to uncertainty that had loomed over negotiations all day.In a letter to House Democrats on Friday evening ahead of the President's tweets, Pelosi announced a deal, saying, "we are proud to have reached an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges."Despite the announcement of an agreement, however, the White House and Pelosi's office were still sorting out issues into Friday evening with the legislative language, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Pelosi said in her letter that the legislation is made up of a number of provisions, including "free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured."The legislation will also provide, according to Pelosi, "paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave."It will also expand federal funding for Medicaid "to support our local, state, tribal and territorial governments and health systems, so that they have the resources necessary to combat this crisis."House Democrats had been planning to vote Friday on a coronavirus relief measure with or without bipartisan support amid uncertainty over when exactly the vote will happen and whether the Trump administration will ultimately get behind the bill.Trump earlier criticized the legislative package during a news conference on Friday afternoon from the White House even as Pelosi and Mnuchin continued to negotiate.In remarks delivered from the U.S. Capitol roughly an hour before the President publicly expressed his dissatisfaction, Pelosi insisted that the House of Representatives will move to pass the legislation, saying definitively, "Today, we are passing a bill." House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer echoed that priority in a letter to House Democrats saying that the House would vote on a relief bill one way or another."The speaker has literally been working around the clock to achieve a bipartisan agreement on our further response to the crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic," the Maryland Democrat said. "If we reach agreement, we'll vote on it. If not, we will vote today on our bill, which incorporates nearly all of what the Administration and Republicans have requested."The House has been gearing up for a vote after top negotiators spent the past day in discussions over how to reach a consensus agreement between House Democrats and the Trump administration.The concern over coronavirus has scrambled leaders to try and pass a comprehensive package that would address paid sick leave and expand the social safety net for vulnerable children and families whose lives may be disrupted by the virus.The effort comes as concern and anxiety mounts over the rapid spread of coronavirus across the United States — a development that has jolted the financial markets.Throughout the day on Friday, however, uncertainty over whether the President would ultimately get behind the legislative package complicated negotiations.During a Friday afternoon press conference, however, Trump did not say he would support the legislation."Well, we just don't think they're giving enough. We don't think the Democrats are giving enough," the president said."We're negotiating. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn't agree to certain things that they agreed to. We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country."Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy convened a last-minute conference call with his members, walking them through remaining sticking points even as he remained upbeat a deal could still be clinched over the upcoming hours.The California Republican told members that there were plenty of good things in the bill — particularly on the testing elements, which have strong GOP support. But McCarthy also addressed that there were some glaring technical mistakes, and that the GOP wanted to do more to ensure concerns about supporting small business jobs were addressed.Congress passed an $8.3 billion total coronavirus response package last week, but there is a strong sense among lawmakers that more needed to be done to respond to the economic fallout from the spread of the virus.

We don't think the Democrats are giving enough," the president said. "We're negotiating. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden they didn't agree to certain things that they agreed to. We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country." Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy convened a last-minute conference call with his members, walking them through remaining sticking points even as he remained upbeat a deal could still be clinched over the upcoming hours. The California Republican told members that there were plenty of good things in the bill — particularly on the testing elements, which have strong GOP support. But McCarthy also addressed that there were some glaring technical mistakes, and that the GOP wanted to do more to ensure concerns about supporting small business jobs were addressed. Congress passed an $8.3 billion total coronavirus response package last week, but there is a strong sense among lawmakers that more needed to be done to respond to the economic fallout from the spread of the virus.

Georgia to postpone primaries over coronavirus; 2nd state to do so
.W
Georgia's March 24 presidential primaries will be postponed until May because of fears over the new coronavirus.

Georgia's March 24 presidential primaries will be postponed until May because of fears over the new coronavirus, state election officials announced Saturday, a day after Louisiana also pushed back its primaries.In-person early voting, which began statewide March 2, will be halted and the election will be moved to May 19, when Georgia’s other 2020 primary elections are being held, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement Saturday.In addition to public safety, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older, election officials said.“Events are moving rapidly, and my highest priority is protecting the health of our poll workers and the community at large,” Raffensperger said.The action followed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature of an emergency declaration that unlocked sweeping powers to fight COVID-19. In a speech Saturday, the governor renewed a call for places of worship, schools and others to consider canceling large gatherings as cases in the state rise.On Friday, Louisiana became the first state to postpone its presidential primaries due to the virus.As of Saturday, the virus had infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600. Georgia is reporting 66 confirmed cases, with most concentrated around metro Atlanta. One death in the state has been attributed to the virus.Only one candidate is on the Republican ballot in Georgia for the presidential primary: President Donald Trump. The Democratic race has been narrowed to a two-man matchup between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden has been beating Sanders among key demographics at play in Georgia Democratic politics, like African Americans and suburban voters, and has been endorsed by a slew of state and local officials.Raffensperger's office said that the decision to postpone the election was made in consultation with the state Democratic and Republican parties.“Our priority is to protect the health and safety of all Georgians and to ensure that as many people as possible have an opportunity to vote,” state Sen. Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said, according to the statement. “Continued in-person voting could compromise both goals.”All votes already cast, including in-person and absentee ballots, will be counted, the statement says.

Coronavirus is threatening America's blood supply and food banks. Here's how you can help

The national blood supply is low, empty shelves signal foreboding at food banks and vulnerable communities are at risk.

The national blood supply is low, empty shelves signal foreboding at food banks and vulnerable communities are at risk.As coronavirus spreads across the U.S., people are worried about keeping their families safe. But, what about your fellow man? For people in need, dealing with coronavirus is an added stress.The organizations that support them are asking for help in this time of uncertainty. Some are facing serious challenges as the virus spreads, while others are coming up with creative ways to anticipate their needs.This is how you can help.There is a serious need for blood More than 600 blood drives across the country have been canceled due to coronavirus concerns, the American Red Cross said Friday. That's about 18,000 blood donations that were never made."In my 31 years, I've not been as concerned about what could happen to the blood supply as I am now simply because of the degree of influence the coronavirus is having over public decisions," Chris Hrouda, president of Red Cross Blood biomedical services, told CNN.It's important that people donate now while parts of the country are still healthy, Hrouda said. About 80% of Red Cross blood collections come from blood drives hosted by sponsors like schools, churches and businesses.Blood supplies must constantly be replenished because blood is perishable. When blood drives are canceled, that threatens the inventory, he said. A unit of red blood cells can last for 42 days, while platelets only have a five-day shelf life.Hard-hit coronavirus areas, like the Pacific Northwest, are struggling even more. The region's blood supply is "in danger of collapse," Bloodworks Northwest, a blood services and research nonprofit, said in a statement.How you can help: Blood donors are needed, as are sponsors to host drives. All types are needed, but blood type O and platelets are what's most needed, said the American Red Cross. To find a blood drive near you, click here.The shelves at some food banks are going unstockedCanned food donations are declining and one food bank in Stamford, Connecticut, can't keep its shelves stocked.Unfortunately, people seem to be stockpiling canned goods at home, said Kate Lombardo with the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County."There's another population that needs to be able to hunker down for the possibility in case they are quarantined," Lombardo told CNN. "Most people don't have that extra $100 to $200 to spend on food to ready their household for two weeks' worth of groceries."Pasta, spaghetti sauce and cereal are usually always on the shelves, but these days, even those items are gone, she said. The food bank has had to use donations to purchase food to replenish their supply."It's just frightening for people who live hand to mouth on a daily basis," Lombardo said. "There's already a stress factor of poverty, let alone the additional stress coming from a pandemic."The food bank provides food to 90 agencies and programs, like food pantries and soup kitchens, which give the food to those in need.Soup kitchens are feeling the ripple effect, too. Brooklyn soup kitchen and women's shelter Community Help in Park Slope, Inc. says it will not close, despite the uptick in coronavirus cases in New York.The soup kitchen has moved from serving indoor seated meals to take-out, so there aren't large gatherings of people, said Executive Director Denise Scaravella."We're not turning anybody away. We have donations for cold lunch supplies," Scaravella told CNN. "Volunteers are showing up, we are cooking and we are handing the food out. We just aren't having people to come in and eat."How you can help: Various food banks and food pantries have different needs. The Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County is asking for canned food donations, while CHiPS said it needs disposable containers and utensils after switching to take-out.

Andy Bales. "We are erring in the side of caution."The shelter added several stations so people can wash their hands with hot water and follow good hygiene, he said. Doorknobs, door handles and elevator buttons are being disinfected 9 times per day.How you can help: Homeless shelters like Union Rescue Mission are asking that people share essentials like toilet paper, soaps, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Masks, gloves and protective equipment are also welcome, as staff at shelters need to be able to protect themselves while serving those in need.To report a person who needs help on the street, you can call 311 to connect with homeless outreach in your city, or dial 211 to reach local, essential community services. The Veterans Administration also operates a 24/7 hotline for homeless vets at 877-4AID-VET (877-424-3838) and an online chat service.Homebound elderly need mealsWhile the public worries about working from home and isolating, a huge segment of the population already does that: the elderly.Often elderly people may have trouble shopping and cooking if they have mobility issues.Meals on Wheels programs provide hot meals daily to seniors and those who are homebound. Getting a hot meal is important for nutrition, but it's also a chance for a senior to have a visit and not feel so isolated, said Steve King with Meals on Wheels of Tampa."We're preparing frozen meals that in the event that we run too short and can't get a hot meal to somebody every day, we can give them frozen meals for a seven-day period," King said.Meals on Wheels America said its local programs are having to adapt."Delivery methods are also being adjusted to lessen the risk of person to person contact," said Meals on Wheels America spokeswoman Jenny Young. "Volunteers may no longer enter the home and they may deliver more shelf-stable or frozen meals at one time to lessen the frequency of delivery."Losing that personal connection will be tough, so the organization said many local programs will call its seniors to check on their safety and wellbeing, she said.How you can help: Look out for neighbors. If you're going to the grocery store, offer to pick up whatever they need. Or, ask if an elderly neighbor needs a ride. To donate to Meals on Wheels America, click here.

Fake coronavirus testing kits seized at Los Angeles airport
.W
The parcel arriving from the United Kingdom this week was declared as purified water vials valued at nearly $200, but had labels referring to the coronavirus.

Federal authorities warned consumers Saturday about fake home-testing kits for the coronavirus after customs agents intercepted a package at Los Angeles International Airport filled with vials labeled as COVID-19 test kits.The parcel arriving from the United Kingdom this week was declared as purified water vials valued at nearly $200. But when U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspected it they discovered the labels referring to the coronavirus. “The American public should be aware of bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings,” the agency said in a statement Saturday.Testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is only conducted in verified state and local public laboratories across the country. On Friday, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and laid out new testing strategies after health care professionals, politicians and patients across the country complained about lack of access to testing.However, public confusion persisted over who should be tested and how to get checked for the disease.No further details, including any arrest connected to the intercepted package, were released. The vials were turned over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis.             LOS ANGELES

Fed takes emergency action, including slashing rate by full percentage point
.W
Responding to a troubling economy, the Federal Reserve took emergency action Sunday.

The Federal Reserve took emergency action Sunday and slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero and announced it would purchase more Treasury securities to encourage lending to try to offset the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The central bank said the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. The central bank said it will keep rates at nearly zero until it feels confident the economy has weathered recent events.The Fed also said it will purchase $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to smooth over market disruptions that have made it hard for banks and large investors to sell Treasuries.The disruptions bumped up the yield on the 10-year Treasury last week, an unusual move that threatens to push borrowing costs for mortgages and credit cards higher. The Fed also said it has dropped its requirements that banks hold cash reserves in another move to encourage lending.The Fed also announced that it has cut interest rates on dollar loans in a joint action that it has taken with five central banks overseas. That is intended to ensure that foreign banks continue to have access to dollars that they lend to overseas companies.All told, the Fed's actions amount to a recognition that the U.S. economy faces its most perilous juncture since the recession ended more than a decade ago.By aggressively slashing its benchmark short-term rate to near zero and pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system, the Fed’s moves Sunday recalled the emergency action it took at the height of the financial crisis. Starting in 2008, the Fed cut its key rate to near zero and kept it there for seven years. The central bank has now returned that rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — to its record-low level.Still, with the virus's spread causing a broad shutdown of economic activity in the United States, the Fed faces a daunting task. Its tools — intended to ease borrowing rates, facilitate lending and boost confidence — aren't ideally suited to offset a fear-driven halt in spending and traveling.“We have to hope that the Fed getting out in front of events, not to mention other central banks, pushes the economy in the right direction,’’ said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The heavy lifting for stimulus and for preventing lasting economic damage has to be done on the fiscal side.

Most economists, however, believe a recession is already here or will be soon. JPMorgan Chase predicts the economy will shrink 2% in the current quarter and 3% in the April-June quarter.“I don't think so,” Mnuchin said when asked if the U.S. is in recession. “The real issue is what economic tools are we going to use to make sure we get through this.”On Saturday, President Donald Trump reiterated his frequent demand that the Fed “get on board and do what they should do," reflecting his argument that benchmark U.S. rates should be as low as they are in Europe and Japan, where they're now negative. Negative rates are generally seen as a sign of economic distress, and there's little evidence that they help stimulate growth. Fed officials have indicated that they're unlikely to cut rates below zero.With the virus depressing travel, spending and corporate investment and forcing the cancellation of sports leagues, business conferences, music performances and Broadway shows, economists increasingly expect the economy to shrink for at least one or two quarters. A six-month contraction would meet an informal definition of a recession.                        The Federal Reserve took emergency action Sunday and slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero and announced it would purchase more Treasury securities to encourage lending to try to offset the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.  The central bank said the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. The central bank said it will keep rates at nearly zero until it feels confident the economy has weathered recent events.                              Advertisement                       The Fed also said it will purchase $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to smooth over market disruptions that have made it hard for banks and large investors to sell Treasuries. The disruptions bumped up the yield on the 10-year Treasury last week, an unusual move that threatens to push borrowing costs for mortgages and credit cards higher. The Fed also said it has dropped its requirements that banks hold cash reserves in another move to encourage lending.                         The Fed also announced that it has cut interest rates on dollar loans in a joint action that it has taken with five central banks overseas. That is intended to ensure that foreign banks continue to have access to dollars that they lend to overseas companies. All told, the Fed's actions amount to a recognition that the U.S. economy faces its most perilous juncture since the recession ended more than a decade ago. By aggressively slashing its benchmark short-term rate to near zero and pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system, the Fed’s moves Sunday recalled the emergency action it took at the height of the financial crisis. Starting in 2008, the Fed cut its key rate to near zero and kept it there for seven years. The central bank has now returned that rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — to its record-low level. Still, with the virus's spread causing a broad shutdown of economic activity in the United States, the Fed faces a daunting task. Its tools — intended to ease borrowing rates, facilitate lending and boost confidence — aren't ideally suited to offset a fear-driven halt in spending and traveling. “We have to hope that the Fed getting out in front of events, not to mention other central banks, pushes the economy in the right direction,’’ said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The heavy lifting for stimulus and for preventing lasting economic damage has to be done on the fiscal side. That’s (the) nature of this shock.’’ “It confirms that the Fed sees the economy going down ... very sharply’’ toward recession, Posen said.

CDC's latest guidance could mean no sports for much longer
.W
Federal officials said Sunday they recommend all in-person events involving 50 people or more be called off for the next eight weeks. That’s twice as long as the 30-day shutdowns that the NBA, NHL and Major League Soccer decided to put into place.

The already-delayed professional sports seasons in North America could be on hiatus for significantly longer than first planned after federal officials said Sunday that they recommend all in-person events involving 50 people or more be called off for the next eight weeks.That’s twice as long as the 30-day shutdowns the NBA, NHL and Major League Soccer decided to put into place last week in response to the global coronavirus pandemic that has already made a deep impact on the U.S. financial markets and has been blamed for at least 64 deaths in this country.Major League Baseball also was going with what essentially was a 30-day shutdown after canceling the rest of spring training and pushing back the start of regular season play for two weeks; opening day was to have been March 26.But new recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday night seem to suggest that sports in this country could for all intents and purposes be gone until May, if not later.“CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers ... cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States,” it said. “Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene and social distancing.”The eight-week window easily exceeds what would have been the remainder of the NBA and NHL regular seasons, plus would cover about the first 25% of the MLB season — or roughly 40 games per team. It would also cast serious doubt on the ability to hold other major U.S. sporting events as planned, such as the Kentucky Derby in early May.The NBA was already bracing to play games without fans in arenas, something that would have started late last week had a player -- Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz -- not tested positive for the virus, COVID-19. Utah teammate Donovan Mitchell and Detroit’s Christian Wood have tested positive since, but Gobert’s diagnosis was enough for the league to say that it was suspending play.“I’ve been feeling a little better every single day,” Gobert said in a video posted Sunday. He added, “I wish I would have took this thing more seriously.”Later Sunday, a person with knowledge of the matter said the NBA has sent teams a memo saying players can leave their home markets during the shutdown if they so choose — yet another clear sign that the game's hiatus is not ending anytime soon. But if those players do leave for another market, they must do so after coordinating plans with their teams and medical advisers.The memo also told teams formal practices will remain off indefinitely, individual workouts at team facilities may continue and detailed other safeguards teams should be taking at this point, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the memo had not been released publicly.The NBA has already been asking teams to share availability for their arenas through the end of July, a sign that the league is prepared to extend the season at least that long if necessary — and those moves came a couple of days before the CDC made its latest recommendation. The NBA regular season was to have ended April 15 and the NBA Finals were to have started June 4, with the season done on or before June 21.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.It’s not just the team sports that have been shut down: Pro tennis and golf have basically been called off for the next several weeks, with such marquee events as Indian Wells and the Miami Open in tennis and The Players Championship and Masters in golf either canceled or postponed. The NCAA men’s Division I college basketball tournament — March Madness — was to release its bracket Sunday and start the now-canceled 68-team tournament Tuesday. The women’s Division I tournament was to have started this week.They’ve all been called off, as have all other winter- and spring-sport seasons at all levels of the NCAA. Most high school state associations have also had to cancel seasons and championships as well. Some minor-league hockey leagues have canceled seasons, and it seems increasingly unlikely that the G League -- the NBA’s minor league -- will resume play this season. Even a polo match in South Florida on Sunday was played without fans or reporters present, with organizers saying they needed to take ultimate precautions.Some NBA players were spending Sunday at home playing video games; Miami’s Goran Dragic posted a video of himself outside his house kicking a soccer ball around. Others, like Golden State’s Stephen Curry, were urging their fans to continue taking the pandemic seriously.“We all have to take responsibility for ourselves and do whatever it takes to #stopthespread,” Curry told his 14.1 million followers on Twitter. “There’s a sense of urgency to flatten the curve and give ourselves and the healthcare system the best chance to get through this pandemic.

The coronavirus has sickened nearly 80,000 and killed nearly 2,500 people worldwide.

U.S. health officials released an elevated warning Tuesday about the spread of coronavirus.“Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in the United States," said Nancy Messonnier, a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during briefings with lawmakers and reporters.“It’s not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses.”The coronavirus, which has sickened more than 80,000 and killed nearly 2,500 people worldwide, belongs to a large family of viruses that mostly sicken animals. But this coronavirus, like SARS and MERS, "jumped the species barrier" to infect people on a large scale, according to officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Officials scrambled to halt the spread of a burgeoning virus Tuesday, from northern Italy where troops were dispatched to enforce quarantines and schools were shuttered, to South Korea, where some neighborhoods in a city of 2.5 million were brought to a near standstill.New clusters of the illness popped up far from its apparent point of origin in China, fueling apprehension in world financial markets and political institutions. The spread fueled an increased sense of urgency among officials in some of the wealthiest nations in Europe and Asia, as well as in countries like Iran, with far fewer resources to stem the disease. But many remained uncertain about how best to contain it.The U.S. began putting travel restrictions in place in January, temporarily denying entry to foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days before their arrival to the U.S., a health official said.Restrictions also apply to U.S. citizens who have been in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, in the two weeks prior to their return to the United States. Upon their return, those citizens will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of up to 14 days, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday.Here's what we know about the cases in the U.S.:As of Feb. 25, coronavirus cases have been diagnosed in six states: Arizona (one case), California (eight), Illinois (two), Massachusetts (one), Washington (one), and Wisconsin (one).Twelve of these 14 cases were patients who had traveled to China, and two cases occurred through person-to-person transmission. That case involved two patients who lived in the same household. An additional 39 cases were reported among repatriated U.S. citizens, residents, and their families returning from Hubei province, China (three), and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was docked in Yokohama, Japan (36). Thus, there have been 53 cases within the United States. No deaths have been reported in the United States, according to the CDC.Who's still at riskThe CDC is continuing monitoring potential cases in the U.S.Though health officials have confirmed one case of person-to-person contact, they maintain that the immediate risk to the public is low.

Coronavirus 'WILL' spread in the US, CDC says
.W
“It’s not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses," a top official with the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.

U.S. health officials are issuing an elevated warning about the spread of coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in the United States," said Nancy Messonnier, a top official at the CDC, during briefings with lawmakers and reporters Tuesday. “It’s not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses.” Officials scrambled to halt the spread of a burgeoning virus Tuesday, from northern Italy where troops were dispatched to enforce quarantines and schools were shuttered, to South Korea, where some neighborhoods in a city of 2.5 million were brought to a near standstill.New clusters of the illness popped up far from its apparent point of origin in China, fueling apprehension in world financial markets and political institutions. The spread fueled an increased sense of urgency among officials in some of the wealthiest nations in Europe and Asia, as well as in countries like Iran, with far fewer resources to stem the disease. But many remained uncertain about how best to contain it.     At a press conference during his visit to India on Tuesday, President Trump made a number of claims about the virus, which has sickened 80,000 and killed 2,700."I think that's a problem that's going to go away," Trump said of the virus, which has expanded this week in Italy, Austria, Croatia and Iran. In Iran, a day after the health minster appeared publicly to make clear that all was well, it was announced he had coronavirus.In that news conference, Trump alleged that "we're very close to a vaccine." However, there is no available evidence that a vaccine is "close," in fact, most infectious disease experts say developing a vaccine for the virus is roughly a year away. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tennessee), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday morning that "the vaccine for the coronavirus is moving more rapidly than any vaccine we have already tried to approve -- but it will take a year or 18 months. The way to stop (an outbreak) is quarantine and monitoring."Trump also claimed in the news conference that all the U.S. coronavirus patients "are getting better ... they're all getting better."  The latest tally shows 53 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States as well as several other Americans with the virus in Japan. In Italy’s north, where more than 200 people were sickened, a dozen towns were sealed off and police wearing face masks patrolled.Two neighbors of Italy — Croatia and Austria — have reported their first cases of the virus. And an Italian doctor staying at a hotel in the Canary Islands tested positive for the virus, prompting the quarantine of hundreds of guests.     China reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic was first detected in December. The updates bring mainland China's totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths.The World Health Organization said Monday the fatality rate was between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Dr. Bruce Aylward, the WHO envoy who led a team just back from China, told reporters Tuesday the reason for the large discrepancy was partly because the disease hit Wuhan early and fast, when “people didn’t know what we were dealing with, were learning how to treat this.”At the beginning of the outbreak, “people were finding severe disease, that’s why the alarm bell went off,” Aylward said. But now with more aggressive testing, mild cases are being diagnosed and isolated.Still, he expressed frustration at people saying, “'Oh, the mortality rate’s not so bad because there’s way more mild cases.' Sorry, the same number of people that were dying, still die.”While China remains home to the vast majority of cases, the world's attention has increasingly moved to where the outbreak would spread next. Iran was eyed as a source for new transmissions in the Middle East, including in Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, which were grappling with the spread past their borders. The Associated Press and CNN contributed to this story.

At a press conference during his visit to India on Tuesday, President Trump made a number of claims about the virus, which has sickened 80,000 and killed 2,700. "I think that's a problem that's going to go away," Trump said of the virus, which has expanded this week in Italy, Austria, Croatia and Iran. In Iran, a day after the health minster appeared publicly to make clear that all was well, it was announced he had coronavirus. In that news conference, Trump alleged that "we're very close to a vaccine."  However, there is no available evidence that a vaccine is "close," in fact, most infectious disease experts say developing a vaccine for the virus is roughly a year away.  Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tennessee), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday morning that "the vaccine for the coronavirus is moving more rapidly than any vaccine we have already tried to approve -- but it will take a year or 18 months. The way to stop (an outbreak) is quarantine and monitoring." Trump also claimed in the news conference that all the U.S. coronavirus patients "are getting better ... they're all getting better."                       The latest tally shows 53 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States as well as several other Americans with the virus in Japan.  In Italy’s north, where more than 200 people were sickened, a dozen towns were sealed off and police wearing face masks patrolled. Two neighbors of Italy — Croatia and Austria — have reported their first cases of the virus. And an Italian doctor staying at a hotel in the Canary Islands tested positive for the virus, prompting the quarantine of hundreds of guests.      China reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic was first detected in December. The updates bring mainland China's totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths. The World Health Organization said Monday the fatality rate was between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% elsewhere in China. Dr. Bruce Aylward, the WHO envoy who led a team just back from China, told reporters Tuesday the reason for the large discrepancy was partly because the disease hit Wuhan early and fast, when “people didn’t know what we were dealing with, were learning how to treat this.” At the beginning of the outbreak, “people were finding severe disease, that’s why the alarm bell went off,” Aylward said. But now with more aggressive testing, mild cases are being diagnosed and isolated. Still, he expressed frustration at people saying, “'Oh, the mortality rate’s not so bad because there’s way more mild cases.' Sorry, the same number of people that were dying, still die.” While China remains home to the vast majority of cases, the world's attention has increasingly moved to where the outbreak would spread next. Iran was eyed as a source for new transmissions in the Middle East, including in Iraq, Kuwait and Oman, which were grappling with the spread past their borders.

Season's first flu cases confirmed in Maryland
.W
Maryland health officials said the season's first flu cases have been confirmed.

Maryland health officials said the season's first flu cases have been confirmed.The Maryland Department of Health announced Tuesday that there are 11 laboratory-confirmed cases identified since Sept. 1.The majority of the cases so far have been subtyped as influenza A (H3N2), with a few classified as influenza B. The vaccine protects against both influenza A and B, health officials said in a statement."We don't know yet whether flu activity this early indicates a particularly bad season on the horizon," Maryland Health Secretary Robert R. Neall said in a statement. "Still, we can't emphasize strongly enough -- get your flu shot now. Don’t put it off. The vaccine is widely available at grocery stores, pharmacies and local health clinics, in addition to your doctor's office."Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that may lead to serious complications, hospitalization and death. Although most influenza cases are mild and people recover with little to no complications, influenza can pose a serious risk for children younger than 5 years, adults older than 65 years, pregnant women and individuals with compromised immune systems.During last year's influenza season, 3,274 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 82 influenza-associated deaths were reported to the MDH, including four deaths of individuals under the age of 18.The influenza virus spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing, as well as through contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces and objects. Common symptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, coughing and sore throat. Symptoms usually begin one to four days after being exposed."The best way to protect yourself and your family is to get a flu shot. Getting vaccinated every year is important because the strains change over time," Deputy Secretary for Public Health Fran Phillips said in a statement. "Also, keep in mind that it takes about two weeks after being vaccinated before the body's full immune response kicks in."The influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. It is especially important for individuals who are at high risk for influenza-related complications including:Children 6 months through 5 years old;People over 50 years old;Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders;People who are immunocompromised;Women who are or will become pregnant during the flu season;Children and adolescents who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities;People who are extremely obese (body mass index more than 40 for adults).If you think you have the flu:Contact your health care provider to help manage symptoms or complicationsGet rest and drink plenty of fluidsCover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughingUse alcohol-based hand sanitizers and wash your hands oftenStay home from work or school to avoid spreading the fluCDC: Prevent seasonal fluMDH FluWatch             BALTIMORE

From plastic bags to natural hair, here are the new laws coming in 2020
.W
As people across the United States usher in a new decade, a wave of new laws will bring changes big and small.

New year, new rules.As people across the United States usher in a new decade, a wave of new laws will bring changes big and small.From car seats to natural hair, here are some of the ones going into effect in 2020.Minimum wages are going upGood news for workers.The minimum wage is set to go up in 72 jurisdictions in 2020, according to the advocacy group National Employment Law Project.Most of those changes begin on the first day of 2020, though New York's pay raise was set to begin Tuesday, the NELP reported.Twenty-one states and 26 cities and counties, mostly in California, raised the minimum wage on New Year's Day. In 17 of those jurisdictions, the new rate reached or exceeded $15 an hour.Four more states and 23 more cities and counties will join later in the year, with 15 of them raising wages to $15 an hour or more. Illinois and St. Paul, Minnesota, will raise their minimum wages twice in 2020."These increases will put much-needed money into the hands of the lowest-paid workers, many of whom struggle with high and ever-increasing costs of living," researcher and policy analyst Yannet Lathrop wrote in a blog post about the new wages.But let us not forget that the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged since 2009, at $7.25 an hour.You'll get more control over your dataThere's a reason your inbox has been getting spammed with privacy notices lately. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the nation's toughest privacy law, took effect Wednesday.The landmark law allows California residents to demand that companies disclose what data they have collected on them. And if users want that data deleted, companies will have to comply.The law applies to for-profit companies that generate more than $25 million in annual gross revenue, generate more than 50% of their annual revenue from selling customers' personal data or have personal data for more than 50,000 people.CCPA could set a precedent for the rest of the United States -- the law has already prompted other states to consider their own privacy measures.And while non-California residents can't request their data be deleted, they can read through the new terms of service to see what data companies are collecting.More people can sue over sexual abuseAs the #MeToo movement inspired more people to come forward with their experiences of sexual abuse, some states are relaxing their deadlines to bring lawsuits for previous offenses.California suspended the statute of limitations for three years beginning Jan. 1, giving victims of all ages the chance to pursue prosecution.The state also expanded the statute of limitations for childhood victims of sexual abuse. Under the new law, victims have until age 40 or five years from the time the abuse was discovered to file civil lawsuits.Illinois will remove the statute of limitations on criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse, regardless of the age of the victim.The state eliminated time limits on prosecuting sex crimes against minors in 2017, but adult victims still faced a ticking clock. Previously, prosecutors had 10 years to bring charges, but the offense must first have been reported to law enforcement within three years.States tighten and loosen gun lawsAfter another year of mass shootings and heated debates over gun control, states are taking action.Colorado is among the states enacting gun restrictions -- its "red flag" law took effect Jan. 1. The law allows family, household members and law enforcement to petition for a court order to temporarily take guns away from an individual deemed to be in danger of hurting themselves or others.There's already been a lot of opposition to the law, though, and there's no telling what will happen starting Wednesday. A number of the state's counties have declared themselves as Second Amendment "sanctuaries," while some sheriffs have previously said they'd rather go to jail than enforce the law.Meanwhile, Tennessee is moving in the other direction, making it easier for residents to receive a concealed carry handgun permit.Weed is legal in IllinoisPot smokers in the Midwest, rejoice.Anyone 21 and older can buy and possess recreational marijuana in Illinois beginning in the new year.Under the law, Illinois residents can purchase and possess 30 grams of cannabis, 5 grams of cannabis concentrate and cannabis-infused products containing no more than 500 milligrams of THC. People who don't live in Illinois can buy half of each of those amounts.Medical patients can buy marijuana seeds and grow up to five plants at home, as long as the plants are kept out of public view. The law also pardons individuals with nonviolent convictions for amounts of cannabis up to 30 grams.No more cash bailNew York state becomes the latest to end the money bail system, which critics call "wealth-based incarceration."As of Wednesday, the state eliminates money bail for nearly all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases. The new law could free thousands of incarcerated people from pretrial detention, according to a preliminary analysis by the Center for Court Innovation.But there are exceptions, including cases involving sex crimes, domestic violence, witness intimidation or tampering and terrorism-related charges, among others.Plastic bags are outIt's always a good idea to bring reusable bags with you to the grocery store.But starting in 2020, forgetting them at home could cost you.Oregon is the latest state to ban single-use plastic bags at grocery stores, requiring shoppers to bring their own bags or pay a small fee for paper ones.The city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, is also gearing up for a similar eco-friendly initiative.Single-use plastic bags, including compostable bags and plastic ones less than 2.25 millimeters thick, will be banned, according to reports. The city plans to encourage residents to go green by passing out about 2,000 reusable bags at grocery stores and city facilities.No more texting while drivingYou really might want to think twice before sending out that text while you're stopped at an intersection.Starting Wednesday, law enforcement officers in Florida will begin writing tickets for drivers caught texting and driving. Tickets will be $30 for non-moving violations and $60 for moving violations. The fines go up even more if you're speeding.Massachusetts enacts a similar law later in the year.Starting Feb. 23, drivers in the state will be banned from texting and generally using their phone while driving, although Bluetooth and "hands-free" modes will be allowed.Law enforcement officers will issue warnings only for the first month or so, but after March 31, drivers can expect to be fined.Cyclists can breeze through stop signsCyclists have long had to abide by the same traffic laws as their motorized companions -- much to their annoyance. In Oregon, that's going to change.Gone are the days of coming to a complete stop at every stop sign, even when no one else is around. A new state law that went into effect on New Year's Day allows cyclists to treat stop signs and blinking red lights as yields. As long as they slow their bikes to a safe speed, they'll be able to breeze right through.African Americans can embrace their natural hairBlack students and employees in California can finally feel free to be themselves.On Wednesday, the Golden State became the first in the United States to ban employers and school officials from discriminating against people based on their natural hair.The Crown Act makes it illegal to enforce dress code or grooming policies against hairstyles such as Afros, braids, twists and locks."This law protects the right of black Californians to choose to wear their hair in its natural form, without pressure to conform to Eurocentric norms," state Sen. Holly Mitchell said earlier this year. "I am so excited to see the culture change that will ensue from the law."Your middle schooler might need a car seatKids are not going to be happy about this.A new law in Washington state could keep children in booster seats until they're almost in middle school.The law requires children who have outgrown harness seats to sit in booster seats until they are at least 4 feet, 9 inches tall.According to the Washington State Patrol, kids can ditch the booster seats once they're older than 13, KREM reported.

In a pandemic's dark days, these hospice workers found creative ways to bring light
.W
These hospice workers are going above and beyond to create joyful and meaningful moments for patients and their loved ones.

Video above: Coronavirus' impact on hospice careIn ordinary times, music therapy for Michael Russo's hospice patients revolves around glorified home concerts: the troubadour breaks out the guitar, plays Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" or "Crazy" by Willie Nelson and spreads life-affirming joy during a patient's final days.But during the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted hospice facilities to enact strict social distancing policies to minimize the risk of infection, Russo has had to improvise.Instead of one-on-one sessions in patient rooms, he's embraced Facebook Live broadcasts, video call sessions and even recorded messages.During a recent house call to a Tidewell Hospice facility in Punta Gorda, Florida, Russo set up his one-man band on a patio outside a giant window. He was close enough to the lobby so patients could hear him, but safely distanced behind glass so he wouldn't risk infecting his audience."Nurses wheeled patients right up against the window so they could see me and hear me and sing along as they would anywhere else," he said. "We weren't completely together, but it was the next best thing."This sort of innovation has become commonplace at end-of-life facilities these days.At a time when the specter of COVID-19 looms ominously over public health systems around the world, Russo and other hospice workers are going above and beyond to create joyful and meaningful moments for patients and their loved ones. Some of these efforts hinge upon technology. Others are all about heart.Most of the actions constitute simple gestures that typically wouldn't warrant more than a passing "thank you." But in the context of a global pandemic, they loom large and have made a huge difference to people in the last stages of life."Hospice  professionals are trying to care for people in the best ways they know how," said Shoshana Ungerleider, a medical doctor in San Francisco and founder of End Well, a nonprofit and annual conference about grief, loss and dying. "The results have been nothing short of inspiring."Embracing technology to connectTo be clear, patients end up in hospice at the end of long battles with terminal diseases — not because of COVID-19. The threat of coronavirus has prompted hospice facilities to keep these highly vulnerable patients sequestered. This is where the creativity comes in.Many hospice workers have relied upon technology to forge connections, facilitating Zoom or FaceTime chats with family members so neither patients nor loved ones feel alone.Balu Natarajan, chief medical officer at Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care in Rosemont, Illinois, said his company has encouraged its employees to "bend over backward" to make patients feel comfortable and loved in their final moments of life, even if that means acting as liaisons to convey final thoughts or farewell messages over the phone. He noted that Seasons currently has about 6,000 patients spread across facilities in 19 different states."For us, hospice is about making sure our patients die comfortably," said Natarajan, a medical doctor. "So much of what we're talking about is bereavement, or grief for the living after patients die. A lot of that is simply getting loved ones to make a connection before it's too late."Natarajan recounted the story of a nurse who sat with a patient while she died, then on her own volition called the patient's daughter to tell the daughter she was with mom until the end."In that case, the nurse was able to say, 'I was with your mom,'" he said. "It makes a huge difference."Other healthcare experts shared different experiences. Ungerleider, for example, remembered a Seattle funeral director who received FaceTime lessons from members of a local Jewish community to manage ritualistic bathing practices on the body of a temple congregant after he died.The funeral director wasn't Jewish, said Ungerleider, and he had never performed the bathing ritual before."Because of social distancing,  was the only one allowed in with the body, and he was determined to go through the ritual because the other congregants could not," she said. "He didn't have to do it. He wanted to do it. He wanted to let the man's family and the committee of volunteers from the temple bury him in peace."Video above: Teen performs virtual concert nursing homeCare from a distanceIn addition to hospice employees using technology to create memorable moments, some have committed to creating magic in person — just far enough from patients and family members to keep the risk of COVID-19 infections low.In Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, locals recently teamed up with health care professionals to create beautiful and heartfelt chalk murals on the sidewalk outside of a senior living complex in town.Kelly Coons, provider relations manager with hospice company AseraCare, was one of the organizers of the event. She said she went early and marked off 6-foot blocks for each artist, so everyone could stay safely distanced from each other. Some of the children participants drew Easter bunnies and Easter eggs and wrote, "Don't forget to smile." Other artists drew hearts and flowers."Everyone has to stay in their rooms these days, but that doesn't mean we can't bring joy," said Coons.About halfway through the drawing session, one of the residents took a black Sharpie and wrote "thank you" on a pillowcase, then hung it up on the inside of her window."As soon as I saw that pillowcase, it made me smile from ear to ear and I definitely teared up," Coons recounted. "Even in the darkest days of this pandemic, it's still possible to bring light to someone's face."Elsewhere in the nation, other hospice workers have pulled strategies from a similar playbook. At the 14-room Bradenton Hospice House in Bradenton, Florida, for instance, new rules prohibited patients from receiving the sacrament in their waning days, so Clinical Director Stacy Trudelle and some of her colleagues set out to devise a workaround.The team recognized that all the rooms have lanais, or covered porches. Then they realized many of the lanais faced the same grassy area. Suddenly, it hit them: A priest could do the blessings from outside.The first day of the new approach was March 30. That day, nurses wheeled three different patients out to their respective lanais, and a priest gave last rites from the grass, more than 6 feet away. As soon as the priest finished one sacrament, he moved on to the next. Later in the week, after all the patients died, Trudelle said they did so with the comfort that they had received a blessing."We pride ourselves on doing whatever we can do for our patients to make their end-of-life  more comfortable," said Trudelle, who noted that none of the patients had coronavirus. "We're not on the front lines, but that doesn't mean we can't help in other ways."New ways of thinkingEven countrywide organizations are getting in on moment-making action. Exhibit A: The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) in Alexandria, Virginia. In March 2019, this organization launched the "Faces of Caring" social media campaign to spotlight hospice and palliative care worker members who are making a difference in patients' lives.President and CEO Edo Banach says the effort is all about spotlighting the best of humanity."We're letting everybody see the people who are going out there and potentially putting themselves in danger ," he said.Hospice workers are desperate to help people nearing the end of their lives."It just guts me to hear about all of these poor people dying alone," Katie Tyrrell Weimann said.Weimann, 42, is an end-of-life doula, community mental health crisis worker and palliative care social worker from Oak Park, Illinois.The pandemic represents the intersection of Weimann's varied interests, and she has vocally and openly put herself out there to help at the front lines.Earlier this month, Weimann wrote a letter to the administrators at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago offering to act as a "designated family liaison" to sit with patients dying of COVID-19 and navigate goodbyes with loved ones from around the country.She said she would be honored to stay present to facilitate phone calls and virtual messages. The mother of three children also acknowledged that by doing this, she knew she'd be putting her own life at risk."Everyone is throwing eight million ideas out into the universe to make the situation better," she said. "This is mine."Rush Medical Center officials did not respond to interview requests, but Weimann said they had not rejected her offer yet. She hypothesized that one potential sticking point might be the scarcity of available Personal Protective Equipment, and the inability to guarantee that Weimann could secure some to serve in the role.Meanwhile, Weimann had signed up to provide family liaison services remotely as part of palliative care teams assisting with the unfolding public health crisis in New York City.As of press time, she was awaiting her assignment."I believe we have the capacity to hold space for both ourselves and others," Weimann said. "One doesn't negate the other. That's the message of social distancing. We can as a product of common humanity want to protect ourselves and our families, as well as others. The only question is how.

"We weren't completely together, but it was the next best thing."                                                                                                  Michael Russo                       This sort of innovation has become commonplace at end-of-life facilities these days. At a time when the specter of COVID-19 looms ominously over public health systems around the world, Russo and other hospice workers are going above and beyond to create joyful and meaningful moments for patients and their loved ones. Some of these efforts hinge upon technology. Others are all about heart. Most of the actions constitute simple gestures that typically wouldn't warrant more than a passing "thank you." But in the context of a global pandemic, they loom large and have made a huge difference to people in the last stages of life. "Hospice [and palliative care] professionals are trying to care for people in the best ways they know how," said Shoshana Ungerleider, a medical doctor in San Francisco and founder of  End Well , a nonprofit and annual conference about grief, loss and dying. "The results have been nothing short of inspiring." Embracing technology to connect To be clear, patients end up in hospice at the end of long battles with terminal diseases — not because of COVID-19. The threat of coronavirus has prompted hospice facilities to keep these highly vulnerable patients sequestered. This is where the creativity comes in. Many hospice workers have relied upon technology to forge connections, facilitating Zoom or FaceTime chats with family members so neither patients nor loved ones feel alone.                                                                                                  Michael Russo                       Balu Natarajan, chief medical officer at Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care in Rosemont, Illinois, said his company has encouraged its employees to "bend over backward" to make patients feel comfortable and loved in their final moments of life, even if that means acting as liaisons to convey final thoughts or farewell messages over the phone. He noted that Seasons currently has about 6,000 patients spread across facilities in 19 different states. "For us, hospice is about making sure our patients die comfortably," said Natarajan, a medical doctor. "So much of what we're talking about is bereavement, or grief for the living after patients die. A lot of that is simply getting loved ones to make a connection before it's too late." Natarajan recounted the story of a nurse who sat with a patient while she died, then on her own volition called the patient's daughter to tell the daughter she was with mom until the end. "In that case, the nurse was able to say, 'I was with your mom,'" he said. "It makes a huge difference." Other healthcare experts shared different experiences. Ungerleider, for example, remembered a Seattle funeral director who received FaceTime lessons from members of a local Jewish community to manage ritualistic bathing practices on the body of a temple congregant after he died. The funeral director wasn't Jewish, said Ungerleider, and he had never performed the bathing ritual before. "Because of social distancing, [the funeral director] was the only one allowed in with the body, and he was determined to go through the ritual because the other congregants could not," she said. "He didn't have to do it. He wanted to do it. He wanted to let the man's family and the committee of volunteers from the temple bury him in peace."                     Video above: Teen performs virtual concert nursing home Care from a distance In addition to hospice employees using technology to create memorable moments, some have committed to creating magic in person — just far enough from patients and family members to keep the risk of COVID-19 infections low. In Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, locals recently teamed up with health care professionals to create beautiful and heartfelt chalk murals on the sidewalk outside of a senior living complex in town. Kelly Coons, provider relations manager with hospice company AseraCare, was one of the organizers of the event. She said she went early and marked off 6-foot blocks for each artist, so everyone could stay safely distanced from each other. Some of the children participants drew Easter bunnies and Easter eggs and wrote, "Don't forget to smile." Other artists drew hearts and flowers. "Everyone has to stay in their rooms these days, but that doesn't mean we can't bring joy," said Coons. About halfway through the drawing session, one of the residents took a black Sharpie and wrote "thank you" on a pillowcase, then hung it up on the inside of her window. "As soon as I saw that pillowcase, it made me smile from ear to ear and I definitely teared up," Coons recounted. "Even in the darkest days of this pandemic, it's still possible to bring light to someone's face." Elsewhere in the nation, other hospice workers have pulled strategies from a similar playbook. At the 14-room Bradenton Hospice House in Bradenton, Florida, for instance, new rules prohibited patients from receiving the sacrament in their waning days, so Clinical Director Stacy Trudelle and some of her colleagues set out to devise a workaround. The team recognized that all the rooms have lanais, or covered porches. Then they realized many of the lanais faced the same grassy area. Suddenly, it hit them: A priest could do the blessings from outside. The first day of the new approach was March 30. That day, nurses wheeled three different patients out to their respective lanais, and a priest gave last rites from the grass, more than 6 feet away. As soon as the priest finished one sacrament, he moved on to the next. Later in the week, after all the patients died, Trudelle said they did so with the comfort that they had received a blessing. "We pride ourselves on doing whatever we can do for our patients to make their end-of-life [experience] more comfortable," said Trudelle, who noted that none of the patients had coronavirus. "We're not on the front lines, but that doesn't mean we can't help in other ways." New ways of thinking Even countrywide organizations are getting in on moment-making action. Exhibit A: The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) in Alexandria, Virginia. In March 2019, this organization launched the "Faces of Caring" social media campaign to spotlight hospice and palliative care worker members who are making a difference in patients' lives. President and CEO Edo Banach says the effort is all about spotlighting the best of humanity. "We're letting everybody see the people who are going out there and potentially putting themselves in danger [in the time of coronavirus]," he said. Hospice workers are desperate to help people nearing the end of their lives. "It just guts me to hear about all of these poor people dying alone," Katie Tyrrell Weimann said. Weimann, 42, is an end-of-life doula, community mental health crisis worker and palliative care social worker from Oak Park, Illinois. The pandemic represents the intersection of Weimann's varied interests, and she has vocally and openly put herself out there to help at the front lines. Earlier this month, Weimann wrote a letter to the administrators at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago offering to act as a "designated family liaison" to sit with patients dying of COVID-19 and navigate goodbyes with loved ones from around the country. She said she would be honored to stay present to facilitate phone calls and virtual messages. The mother of three children also acknowledged that by doing this, she knew she'd be putting her own life at risk. "Everyone is throwing eight million ideas out into the universe to make the situation better," she said. "This is mine." Rush Medical Center officials did not respond to interview requests, but Weimann said they had not rejected her offer yet. She hypothesized that one potential sticking point might be the scarcity of available Personal Protective Equipment, and the inability to guarantee that Weimann could secure some to serve in the role. Meanwhile, Weimann had signed up to provide family liaison services remotely as part of palliative care teams assisting with the unfolding public health crisis in New York City. As of press time, she was awaiting her assignment. "I believe we have the capacity to hold space for both ourselves and others," Weimann said. "One doesn't negate the other. That's the message of social distancing. We can as a product of common humanity want to protect ourselves and our families, as well as others. The only question is how.

Across the country, prisons and jails have become hotbeds for coronavirus.

In the United States, the largest known concentration of coronavirus cases outside of hospitals isn't on a cruise ship or in a nursing home. It's at a jail in Chicago.At least 276 detainees and 172 staff members — mostly deputies — at Cook County Jail have tested positive for coronavirus, the county sheriff's office said Wednesday. One detainee who tested positive for the virus has died, and at least 21 detainees are hospitalized.Across the country, prisons and jails have become hotbeds for coronavirus. Close confinement is likely fueling the spread."Jails in this country are petri dishes," said Toni Preckwinkle, Cook County Board president. "It's very difficult in a jail to maintain social distancing."But this isn't just a major health problem. It's also a growing safety concern.Melee breaks out in a Washington prisonIn Washington state, violence erupted Wednesday after six inmates at Monroe Correctional Complex tested positive for coronavirus.It started with a demonstration in the recreation yard involving more than 100 inmates, the Washington Department of Corrections said."All measures to bring individuals into compliance were ignored including verbal directives, pepper (OC) spray and sting balls, which release light, noise, and rubber pellets," the department said."Fire extinguishers were set off within two housing units within the Minimum Security Unit, providing an appearance of smoke from the exterior."Authorities used more sting balls in those housing units. "The individuals then stopped the destruction of the two housing units and came into compliance," the department said. No inmates nor staff were injured."It is believed at this time that the incident was caused by recent positive test results of COVID-19 among six men within the Minimum Security Unit," the Department of Corrections said."Those six men were transferred from the Minimum Security Unit on Sunday to the facility's isolation unit. The facility health care team is providing clinical monitoring and supportive care for the individuals in the isolation unit." One of the inmates with coronavirus is 68 years old.Authorities hope the frustration and violence don't escalate. But some inmates at the Monroe prison have threatened to set fires and "take prison guards," Washington State Patrol Trooper Heather Axtman said.The Department of Corrections said it's trying to protect medically vulnerable inmates. And all inmates in the housing unit where the coronavirus patients were previously housed "continue to have no symptoms of illness or disease (asymptomatic) and are wearing surgical masks for further protection.""The Department of Corrections takes the safety and security of its correctional facilities, staff, and incarcerated individuals very seriously," the agency said. "An internal investigation will be completed."Vandalism in Kansas prisonInmates at a prison with 26 positive coronavirus cases in Kansas  vandalized their cell block for hours, an official said Thursday night. The incident happened in cell block C of Lansing Correctional Facility in Lansing, Kansas.Lansing is about 30 miles northwest of Kansas City, Missouri.Randall Bowman of the Kansas Department of Corrections told CNN that the inmates are throwing around laundry and papers, setting off fire extinguishers and moving around furniture and cabinets in the cell.The reason for the vandalism is unclear, he said, adding an investigation is underway.'There's a potential of us dying, too'In the California prison system, the number of inmates infected grew by more than 700% in just over a week. And the number of staff infections nearly tripled, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.As of Wednesday, 29 inmates and more than 60 staff members have tested positive for the virus, the California Department of Corrections said."You have people in Italy dying, people in Spain dying, people in America dying, people are panic buying, people are concerned and people are scared," Samuel Brown, an inmate at California State Prison, Los Angeles County, told CNN."And the truth of the matter is, prisoners are people. So we're also afraid. And there's a potential of us dying, too."A 59-year-old detainee from Chicago's Cook County Jail died after testing positive for coronavirus, sheriff's officials said. His official cause of death has not been released, pending an autopsy.What prisons and jails are doingAt the jail, officials have created a quarantine "boot camp" to keep infected detainees separated from the rest of the population.The jail houses about 4,500 detainees. On Thursday, a federal judge rejected a request by two detainees to order the immediate release or transfer of those who are medically vulnerable.But Judge Matthew Kennelly did order Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart to enact additional sanitation and quarantine guidelines. Any detainees showing coronavirus symptoms must be tested by Saturday, and any detainee who is quarantined must be given a face mask by Sunday.In California, about 3,500 non-violent inmates who have less than 60 days left in their sentences could be released by next Monday, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.Those who could be released will be screened for medical and health problems to ensure they can be placed in a community, KCRA reported.The inmate release is part of an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus while also making more room for those who need to be quarantined or isolated, the department said. At least 1,300 non-violent California inmates have already been released.In addition, inmates across California will receive their meals in their cells or individual housing units to maximize social distancing, the corrections department said.Yard time will still be allowed, but fewer inmates will be released at a time to allow for more space between them.Showers and telephones will be wiped down after each use.

Albert Chambers will turn 100 in July.

Video above: World War II veteran busts a move in quarantine A 99-year-old World War II veteran who survived the coronavirus has been given a guard of honor by nurses as he was discharged from hospital.Albert Chambers, who will turn 100 in July, recovered from the virus at Tickhill Road Hospital in Doncaster, northern England.Chambers was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago after injuring his wrist in a fall. While there, he began to show symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive for the virus.But, despite the fears of his family, he recovered, and nurses at the hospital saw him off with a guard of honor — a moment that was captured on video and shared on social media by the NHS Northeast and Yorkshire health trust."Thank you very much, I appreciate every bit you've done for me. It couldn't have been better," Chambers, who has lived alone since his wife's death almost two decades ago, tells one of the nurses in the video.His grandson, 49-year-old Stephen Gater, told CNN how the family had expected the worst after being told he had contracted COVID-19. But, he said, he believed his grandfather's "fortitude" — gained during his time as a British Army soldier during World War II — helped pull him through.During the war, Chambers was captured by the enemy after being injured in a bomb blast in North Africa. He was transferred to Fallingbostel in northwestern Germany, where he spent three years as a prisoner of war in its Stalag XI B camp.After the war, he protected London's royal palaces as a soldier in the Coldstream Guards."It's nice to have some positive news in the midst of what is a difficult time for everybody," Gater told CNN."When we heard the news, we feared the worst but he's pulled through and it's amazing — the staff there are incredible and we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. We were clapping very ferociously last night at 8 o'clock along with everyone else."It's testament to the care he was getting and his positive attitude and his fortitude."One thing Chambers will have missed, Gater said, was his "guilty secret" — a daily trifle bought from the supermarket Marks & Spencer."I'm just driving up and I've literally just stopped at a service station and bought him a load — so hopefully that'll put a smile on his face," he said.

Drums, dancers livestream as coronavirus moves powwows online

The largest powwows in the country have been canceled and postponed amid the spread of the coronavirus

The names pop up quickly on Whitney Rencountre's computer screen, and he greets them as he would in person. He spots someone from the Menominee Nation, a Wisconsin tribe that hosts competitive dancers, singers and drummers in traditional regalia in late summer.“Beautiful powwow there,” he says.The emcee from the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe in South Dakota typically is on the powwow circuit in the spring, joining thousands of others in colorful displays of culture and tradition that are at their essence meant to uplift people during difficult times. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the gatherings are taking on a new form online.“Sometimes we have this illusion that we're in total control, but it takes times like this of uncertainty and the challenges of the possibility of death to help us step back and reevaluate,” said Rencountre, a co-organizer of the Facebook group Social Distance Powwow, which sprung up about a month ago as more states and tribes advised people to stay home.Normally this time of year, a string of powwows hosted by Native American tribes and universities would be underway across the U.S., with tribal members honoring and showcasing their cultures — and socializing, like family reunions. The powwows represent an evolution of songs and dances from when tribal traditions were forced underground during European settlement, Rencountre said. The pandemic has canceled or postponed virtually all of them, including two of the largest in the U.S. — the Denver March Powwow and the Gathering of Nations in Albuquerque, New Mexico, held in April.Social Distance Powwow has helped fill the void, quickly growing to more than 125,000 members.Members from different tribal nations post photos and videos of themselves and loved ones dancing, often in their regalia. The page has become a daily dose of prayer, songs, dances, well wishes, humor and happy birthdays. In one video, Jordan Kor sits in his vehicle after a shift at a San Jose, California, hospital emergency department. An old Dakota war song he learned as a child that can be a rallying cry was bouncing around his head. He pulls off his mask and cap and sings, slapping a beat on the steering wheel.“The biggest ones, social distance, keep working in whatever it is that brings you joy and helps you keep connected,” said Kor, who is Tarahumara and Wapetonwon Lakota. “And wash your hands!"The page also hosts a weekly, live powwow with the organizers — Rencountre, Stephanie Hebert and Dan Simonds — assembling a lineup of volunteer drum groups, singers and dancers for the hours-long event. This past weekend, Rencountre patched people in from across the country on the live feed. A marketplace on the site lets vendors showcase their paintings, beadwork, jewelry, basketry and clothing.An online powwow lacks some of the grandeur of being in person and seeing hundreds of performers fill an arena for the grand entry. It doesn't have a roll call of tribal royalty, singers and champion dancers. And it doesn't have categories for competitive dancing. But it offers a way to keep people connected.“When we dance, we are dancing for prayer and protection,” said member Mable Moses of the Lumbee Tribe in North Carolina. "No matter what we do, may the Lord always protect us whether we’re living or dying."Moses learned to dance later in life and now competes in the “golden age” category at powwows. In a video of her Southern Traditional dance, she moves around a dogwood tree in her yard slowly but with high energy.“Even though I'm 72, I'm like 29,” she said.Moses said the dance meant to calm people helps her cope with the fear surrounding the coronavirus, and the difficulty of staying away from others.Tribal members also are posting elsewhere on social media, including youth hoop dancers from Pojoaque Pueblo in New Mexico.For those viewing for the first time, Rencountre encourages an open mind.“We ask them to break down the wall, to feel the dances, to feel the songs, as you’re watching,” he said. “Don’t think about it from a technical point of view. Understand the creation of these songs and dances comes from a place of uplifting.”Leiha Peters grew up doing jingle dress dance meant for healing. The dress is characterized by cone-shaped jingles typically made from the lids of tobacco cans. Now, she does beadwork for her children's outfits and is a Seneca language teacher.She recently posted a video of two of her children and their cousins doing smoke dance in the living room of her home on the Tonawanda Indian Reservation northeast of Buffalo, New York. Its origins are mixed as a dance for men to bless themselves before they went to battle and a way to clear smoke from traditional homes called longhouses, she said.Her children grow up knowing the respect and the protocol that accompany the dance and its songs. They also have fun with it, sometimes competing in the family's backyard to win cups of Kool-Aid or bags of candy, Peters said.“For them, dancing is medicine on its own. It’s everything to us,” she said. “It’s energy, it’s athleticism, it’s staying healthy and living a better life with food choices. It’s not easy doing what they do.”              FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.

Who needs vacation when you are quarantined with Super Dad

When coronavirus canceled his family's vacation to Disney, Jesus Torres did not let that stop the fun! Torres transformed his home into an “It’s a Small World," for his 18-month-old daughter, Isla. "We've been staying at home playing a lot of games, dancing, listening to music, and I was like, I don't know what else to do," Torres said. "So randomly I just came up with the idea to bring Disney to her."The ride was equipped with a cardboard box or a ride-car and stuffed-animal friends singing along to the ride's namesake song, "It's a Small World." The world is a big place, but Torres definitely made this world feel a little ... smaller. Have your plans been changed by coronavirus?

Family celebrates 100th birthday through nursing home window

Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Millie Erickson almost had to celebrate her 100th birthday without her family.

The smile on Millie Erickson's face says it all. While she didn't get to blow out candle or open gifts, having her family outside the window of her nursing home was just what she needed for her 100th birthday. Erickson is a resident at Sterling Village in Massachusetts, which has tightened its visitation policy along with other nursing homes and hospitals during the coronavirus outbreak. "We can't go inside to see her because she's quarantined in," said Erickson's son, Gary. Because of the occasion, the nursing home staff and Erickson's family got creative and were able to sing "Happy Birthday," to her from outside. "It was really nice that they let us do that," Gary Erickson said. "She doesn't usually cry, but she did. She's just thrilled to see everybody and she's lived a good, long life."

Several internet providers have pledged late fee waivers, free Wi-Fi hotspots and other assistance for customers affected by the coronavirus.

As schools close and businesses begin to adjust operations, many Americans will be affected by efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and one internet provider is offering families a hand. Charter Communications, a Connecticut-based company, says it will offer free Spectrum broadband and Wi-Fi access for 60 days for households with students who do not already have an internet subscription starting today, according to a news release. "As the country works collaboratively to contain this pandemic, broadband internet access will be increasingly essential to ensuring that people across the country are able to learn and work remotely, that businesses can continue to serve customers, and that Americans stay connected and engaged with family and friends," the release says. Comcast has also announced policy changes in response to the far-reaching impacts of the coronavirus, including free Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots for all, including nonsubscribers.Comcast is also pausing data plans for 60 days, giving all customers unlimited data for no additional charge, and has pledged not to disconnect customers' internet service or assess late fees "if they contact us and let us know that they can't pay their bills during this period." "Our care teams will be available to offer flexible payment options and can help find other solutions," Comcast's website says. AT&T has also promised not to terminate wireless, home phone, residential or small business broadband services "because of their inability to pay their bill due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic." Both AT&T and Verizon have also pledged to waive any late fee payments for customers affected by the outbreak."Due to economic circumstances related to the coronavirus and to keep customers connected during this economic and global crisis, Verizon waives late fees for those impacted by COVID-19," Verizon's website says.

Northeast Ohio jail seeking to release hundreds of inmates due to COVID-19 concerns
.W
Corrections officers across the U.S. are concerned about their safety regarding the spread of the new virus in facilities, too.

A jail system that covers Cleveland and surrounding suburbs is looking to release as many as 300 nonviolent or low-risk offenders.The court system is looking to expedite cases, attempting to avoid issues surrounding a potential outbreak of inmates being affected in the approximately 1,900-person jail."We don’t want the public to panic; this is not like the jail is opening the door and everyone is running out," Judge Brendan Sheehan told WEWS-TV.Cuyahoga County's common pleas court was holding extra hearings Saturday, trying to reduce the jail population in part by settling cases with guilty pleas and either releasing them or sending them to prison or house arrest, WJW-TV reported.Compounding the concern is the fact that many prisoners hit the chronic-disease or age risk factors for severe coronavirus illness. Prisoners and jail inmates are more likely than the general population to ever report having a chronic condition or infectious disease, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The prison population is increasing in age as well. In 2016, 11% of the 1.45 million people in state and federal prisons were over the age of 55, up from 3% in 1999, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts."If someone’s a serious violent person, well, we’re using our discretion to make sure the community’s safe also," Sheehan told WJW-TV.Earlier this month, Iran announced it would temporarily release 70,000 inmates due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, the United States' 122 federal prisons and many of the 1,700-plus state prisons have banned visitors and volunteers, hoping to prevent potentially disastrous coronavirus outbreaks among prisoners and staff in close quarters where disease can easily spread.Video: Pennsylvania Department of Corrections cancels inmate visit because of coronavirusThe Federal Bureau of Prisons announced its ban Friday, joining most states and some counties taking the same measure in their own prisons or jails.The federal prisons are generally banning lawyer visits for 30 days — a step further than most state facilities — though confidential legal calls are allowed, and lawyers can request exceptions.The intent is to keep outsiders from introducing the virus to the facilities where the nation's roughly 2.2 million prisoners and jail inmates live, and where the disease could spread rapidly, as the mumps outbreaks of 2019 in Texas and New Jersey jails showed."You can't keep a 2- to 3-foot distance from inmates, and they can't keep that distance themselves," said Ray Coleman Jr., a teacher at the federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, and president of the local union representing the facility's correctional officers. No states were reporting outbreaks at prisons as of Saturday morning. But the advocacy group Human Rights Watch has proposed that prisons, jails and immigration detention centers consider supervised release for people with high-risk factors like chronic disease.And the ACLU of Louisiana has called for expedited parole hearings for elderly prisoners and the release of all jailed people awaiting trial who aren't considered a public safety risk. The bans, and how prisons are compensating, varyThe bans on outsiders vary in detail by jurisdiction, but generally at the federal and state level, they include even non-contact visits with glass partitions.The moves are similar to how some states are restricting access to nursing homes and assisted living facilities. More than 35 states had announced visitation bans in state prisons by Saturday morning.Some county jails, like the one in Los Angeles County, are keeping visitors out.To compensate, federal prisons and many states say they are increasing prisoners' number of phone calls, or number of total minutes allotted for calls."We know that it's going to be hard ... on families and on prisoners where that visit is so important," Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday, announcing visitation bans in Kentucky's state prisons. "But this is about protecting their health, the health of our corrections officers, and making sure that we get through this."Some states, including Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio and South Dakota, are expanding or otherwise touting prisoners' ability to connect with people on the outside by video.Generally, states are allowing in-person legal visits, with attorneys subject to health screenings before entering.Even some states that hadn't announced full visitation bans by Saturday morning did have restrictions. Arkansas, Nebraska and New Hampshire were screening visitors and employees for symptoms. Iowa has banned volunteers but was allowing non-contact visits. However, the state warned even those could be suspended soon.Corrections officers are concerned about their safety, tooReducing visitor traffic at prisons may help slow spread of the disease to corrections officers, without whom prisons can't run. While many businesses are encouraging workers to telecommute, corrections officers have no such option.The more officers call in sick, the more strain will be put on staffing levels. That would be hard especially in federal prisons, which have long faced staffing shortages, said Joe Rojas, Southeast region vice president of the union representing federal corrections officers, the American Federation of Government Employees' Council of Prison Locals."We're already ... short of staff as it is" at the Federal Correctional Complex in Coleman, Florida, where Rojas works as a teacher, he said. That complex has 12 vacancies in the medical department alone, Rojas said, in part because of relatively low pay and rigorous work.Rojas, who spoke to CNN on Friday shortly before federal prison visitor ban was announced, was frustrated that a ban hadn't come days earlier.Both Rojas and Ray Coleman, the Tallahassee prison teacher, said their prisons needed more protective equipment, like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer.Coleman, who said some of these items were on back order, said the Tallahassee prison had about 60 masks for about 250 employees, including 20 medical staff, as of Friday afternoon.The "biggest issue is we don't have resources," Coleman said. "We're having a hard time getting masks and gloves, all of that stuff."The Federal Bureau of Prisons responded by pointing to a statement that AFGE Council of Local Prisons President Shane Fausey released, thanking the Trump administration and bureau Director Michael Carvajal for their "swift, decisive, and unprecedented actions taken to combat the COVID-19 virus and its ominous threat that it poses to our nation's federal prisons.""The BOP appreciates the union's cooperation and assistance as we do everything we can to assure the safety and security of our staff and inmates," said the bureau's Sue Allison on Saturday.The president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represents many workers in state prisons, said the union has been working with state and local officials to push for training, equipment "and other preventative measures to mitigate the potential spread of the virus within correctional facilities.""We call on employers to extend greater flexibility in leave policies and to provide staff access to medical treatment as soon as possible if they are symptomatic," AFSCME President Lee Saunders said Friday. "Our correctional officers regularly step up to keep our communities safe and strong, and they deserve our support and respect in this uncertain and unsettling time."

How parents can homeschool kids during coronavirus outbreak

The coronavirus has turned caregivers around the world into homeschoolers.

School closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak mean millions of parents and guardians who have grown accustomed to sending their children to school are now faced with the task of educating them at home.The coronavirus has turned caregivers around the world into homeschoolers.This transition is daunting. It's unfamiliar. And it's also critically important to ameliorate the disruptions the virus has caused in education for the year.CNN spoke with several parents, teachers and homeschooling experts about how to make the most of homeschooling for your family.Prepare for changesKids accustomed to the school environment won't be as focused. Lessons won't be as professional as the ones they're used to getting. And since local governments are encouraging everyone to minimize interactions with others, socialization will be tough.Kimberly Fox, staff developer for The Reading and Writing Project at Columbia University in New York, said it's important for parents to suspend disbelief and doubt and lean into the new format."We don't have to be school," said Fox, who lives in Brooklyn. "Under these circumstances, we're not going to entirely replace all of the structures that happen at school. But we can do a couple of things to make kids feel more secure and to make us feel like we're making the most of this time."Let kids be part of decision-makingMany schools and school districts have set up online learning platforms or sent kids home with packets of schoolwork to complete. These assignments are non-negotiable. Beyond these requirements, however, parents can give their children a say in what else they'll learn.Jamie Heston, a board member of the Homeschool Association of California, said the best way to do this is to have your kids make a list of things they'd like to do and learn. From there, she said, you can whittle down the options as a family."There are lots of ways you can have fun and have it be educational,  not just be sitting at a table with a book open," said Heston, who lives in Hayward, California.Possibilities include math and chemistry through baking; botany through gardening; basic carpentry; or learning about space through a mobile app.Make a scheduleOnce you and your children have identified the subjects they will study, make a schedule and display it prominently so everyone in the family knows what's coming and when it's over. Most kids work off a schedule in their classrooms, so recreating something similar at home can ease the transition to a different learning environment for the foreseeable future.At the same time, said Jen Reyneri, who has homeschooled two sons (ages 16 and 12), each family should embrace the opportunity to create a rhythm of life that works for them."Include chores, family dinners or breakfasts, and family projects in your new family routines," said Reyneri, who runs a blog and co-owns an Italian restaurant in Hobe Sound, Florida. "Because this is such a unique situation, it's also OK to let everyone sleep in a bit later."Other options for a schedule might include basics such as math, writing, reading and music (to name a few). Some families might also set aside time for educational games accessed by computer or mobile device.For parents who are planning to cultivate a more project-based learning environment — rebuilding a car engine, for instance — put that on the schedule, too.Acknowledge that kids have different needsSchools — particularly public schools — are equipped to teach a variety of children with different learning abilities and different needs. For children with special needs, districts are required by state law to devise individualized education plans (IEPs) to help kids succeed. While parents are an important part of developing these plans, they are generally not the ones who administer them. But in a homeschool environment, parents must run the show.This can get particularly complicated in families with multiple children. Monica Smith, who lives in Healdsburg, California, has twin 7-year-old boys and said one was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Smith said her district just completed an IEP for this child, and she admitted she is anxious about how she'll be able to manage his special needs while also being there for her neurotypical child."Without the help of  resources, I'm nervous about how to best meet his needs and keep him engaged," she said of her special-needs child. "I also need to be conscious of what his twin brother needs, and make sure he doesn't feel 'ignored' just because he has the ability to work independently."One way to address this conundrum is to remember that different kids have different needs, whether at home or at school."Nobody knows your kids better than you do," said J. Allen Weston, executive director of the National Home School Association in Denver. "It's OK to take the time to give  what they need."Build in recessAll traditional school programs incorporate some sort of recess or outdoor time, and a homeschool schedule should be no different.Dr. Jessie Voigts, a homeschooler and founder of Wandering Educators, a global community of educators sharing travel experiences, said it doesn't matter if this time is structured or unstructured, so long as the kids get outside."A walk in the woods is not only healthy for your body and spirit, but your mind, too," said Voigts, who has a PhD in international education and is based in Kalamazoo, Michigan."What new plants are growing? What bugs can you find under decaying logs? Count the tree rings in a downed tree. Reroute a waterway in a little creek. See how the sun moves through the sky. There are so many ways to learn."Downtime is your friendDowntime, or time for kids to work on projects quietly and independently, is just as important as active time outside. Voigts noted that kids need time to "disconnect" every day — from each other, from parents, from technology and from the outside world.Other experts agree. Hannah Gauri Ma, a homeschooler and blogger currently living in St. Albans, in the United Kingdom, said this space allows for independent exploration but also can help reduce friction."Kids will react differently to a parent as 'teacher,' and they will push back in ways they don't at school," said Ma, who runs the popular Loving Earth Parenting website. "Allow for the fact that kids will be holding a lot of tension around all these sudden and often stressful changes to their routines and lives."Get craftyArt is an important part of education, and homeschooling also provides parents with an opportunity to get creative with crafts.Amanda Kingloff, founder of Projectkid.com, a website with tips for crafting, suggested getting creative with materials for different art projects every week. In particular, Kingloff advised reusing washers, buttons, fabric swatches and ribbons, as well as used jars, plastic bottles and cardboard tubes from toilet paper rolls to form the basis for recycled art."You probably have these things around the house anyway," said Kingloff, who lives in Brooklyn. "Many of these materials allow kids to create three-dimensionally without the challenge of sculpting something or making something out of clay."Kingloff noted it's important that parents don't stress about the mess these projects create, since that only detracts from the fun."Put down an oil cloth and let it get messy," she added. "Nobody worries about the mess at school."Accept your limitsChildren aren't the only ones relegated to working from home in the immediate future. Many parents with office jobs have been asked to do the same. This means that hundreds of thousands of mothers and fathers likely will be forced to balance homeschooling with their day-to-day responsibilities at work. It means a whole lot of parents will be forced to juggle like court jesters and circus clowns.Andrew Matranga, a college professor and father of three in Longmont, Colorado, said he thinks it's "ridiculous" to be expected to shoulder the dual burdens of educating his children and the responsibilities of his job, so he's just going to do what he can."We just need to try to do our best, whether we're teachers, parents or working professionals," he said. "There's no map for this journey that we're on."

FDA accuses Jimmy John's of serving vegetables linked to E. coli and salmonella outbreaks
.W
The FDA has warned two popular sandwich ingredients were implicated in E. coli outbreaks.

The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, saying certain vegetables it served were implicated in five outbreaks of E. coli or salmonella in the past seven years.The letter accuses the chain of engaging in a pattern of receiving and selling "adulterated fresh produce, specifically clover sprouts and cucumbers.""Jimmy John's restaurants have been implicated in multiple outbreaks that have spanned the past seven years and impacted consumers in no fewer than 17 states," FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas said in a news release Tuesday."Jimmy John's has not demonstrated implementation of long-term sustainable corrections to its supply chain to assure the safety of ingredients used in its products," he said.The restaurant chain has removed sprouts from all its locations until further notice, Jimmy John's president James North told CNN on Tuesday."Food safety is our top priority ... This removal (of sprouts) was out of an abundance of caution and was not initiated by any known, immediate threat," North said.The FDA letter says Jimmy John's should respond with "the specific things you are doing to address this violation" within 15 days of receiving the warning letter."Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in enforcement action by FDA without further notice, including seizure and/or injunction," the letter reads.The FDA said it also sent a warning letter to a supplier of Jimmy John's. The supplier, the FDA said, provided spouts to the restaurant chain that the administration says sickened 22 people in Iowa late last year with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.The outbreaksAccording to the FDA letter, the four other outbreaks were:• A salmonella outbreak that had infected 10 people as of February 28, 2018, in Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Eight had eaten sprouts on Jimmy John's sandwiches, and one ate sprouts bought at a grocery store.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected 19 people as of August 2014 in California, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, Utah and Washington. Most reported eating clover sprouts in the week before becoming sick, and Jimmy John's was determined to be a likely source in some cases, the FDA said.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected eight people by the end of October 2013 in Colorado. All had eaten raw cucumbers from one of three Jimmy John's restaurants in the Denver area, the FDA said.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected 29 people in 11 states as of April 5, 2012. Most reported eating sprouts at one of six Jimmy John's restaurants in the week preceding their illness, the FDA said.E. coli can cause illness, including diarrhea. Though most healthy adults can recover within a week, some people -- especially young children and the elderly -- can develop a form of kidney failure, the FDA says.Salmonella can cause serious, sometimes fatal, infections, and can be especially serious in young children, according to the FDA.Jimmy John's has more than 2,800 locations in 43 states.

US clinical trials of drug to treat coronavirus begin
.W
This is the first clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate an experimental treatment for the coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China.

A clinical trial for a drug to treat COVID-19, or coronavirus, has begun at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.The trial regulatory sponsor is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. This is the first clinical trial in the United States to evaluate an experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The randomized, controlled clinical trial of the investigational antiviral remdesivir is being tested by hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease. Remdesivir is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment.The first trial participant is an American who was brought to Omaha after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, Japan and volunteered to participate in the study.There are no specific therapeutics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people with COVID-19.As of Feb. 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 77,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,595 deaths in China and 2,069 cases of COVID-19 and 23 deaths in 29 other countries. There have been 14 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in the United States and an additional 39 cases among persons repatriated to the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Dr. Andre Kalil, the infectious diseases specialist and professor of internal medicine who is leading the first clinical trial for the first drug to treat COVID-19, spoke to the media and answered questions in the video below: Kalil said the goal for the trial is to test 400 patients. The patients will be given the drug within 72 hours of diagnosis. The trial will be international but is beginning in Nebraska. Half of the patients will be given the drug and half will be given a placebo. "We should have the results in a year or even less ... at least the preliminary results," he said. "In order to be in the trial, they need to be a little sicker than a mild disease," Kalil said, adding that candidates should have pneumonia in the lungs or lung infection. "The goal here is to help the people who need it the most," he said.              OMAHA, Neb.

Democratic candidates make final pitch before South Carolina, Super Tuesday
.W
Dem candidates were unified in attacking newcomer Bloomberg in their Nevada debate. Now, with Sanders a clear frontrunner, he risks a similar assault on the cusp of South Carolina.

Bernie Sanders' Democratic rivals unleashed a new wave of attacks against the party's presidential front-runner in a high-stakes debate Tuesday night, perhaps their final prime-time opportunity to change the direction of the 2020 nomination fight. All times in Eastern StandardFollow along here for all the updates:9:55 p.m.Asked about his recent comment praising Fidel Castro's literacy program from the early 1960s, Bernie Sanders insisted that he has always "opposed authoritarianism all over the world."  He then turned to Michael Bloomberg, who had moments earlier said he could work with the Chinese government because its leader is responsive to its "politburo."    "I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have a real dictatorship there," Sanders said.Turning back to Cuba, Sanders said "of course" it was a dictatorship but argued that he hadn't gone any farther in praising it than former President Barack Obama did during his efforts to open up relations with the country during his second term."What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and health care," Sanders said. "That was Barack Obama."9:40 p.m.The global spread of the coronavirus came up during tonight's debate. The candidates were asked how they would address the growing epidemic as president.Responding first, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, "What we have to do is make sure we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help."The Minnesota Democrat encouraged people who feel sick to keep checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website because she said "many doctors are just saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here."Former Vice President Joe Biden talked about his experience dealing with the Ebola outbreak during his time in the Obama administration.    "I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. What we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office on diseases that are pandemic diseases. We increased the budget of the CDC, we increased the (National Institutes of Health) budget. Our President today, he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it."Biden attacked President Trump for cutting funding to the CDC. Sen. Bernie Sanders echoed that criticism of Trump.He also went after the president for his comments that the coronavirus will stop spreading once the weather gets warmer.    "In the White House today, we have a self-described great genius — self-described — and this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical date that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined — I wish I was kidding, that is what he said."9:25 p.m.Michael Bloomberg said he would support decriminalizing marijuana, though he wants to see its legality expanded by the states “very slowly.”“We should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those who got caught up in this before,” the former New York mayor said.Bloomberg said he wouldn’t try to undo the efforts of states that have legalized marijuana. But he said the government should heed the warnings of scientists.“They say go very slowly, they haven’t done enough research and the evidence so far is worrisome,” he said. 9:20 p.m.The candidates were asked how they will ensure there is available health care in rural areas of the country that have have populations who are older, sicker, poorer and have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she is for expanding "critical access hospitals" in rural areas. "I am the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered," she said.Mayor Pete Buttigieg said a big part of the problem is "we're seeing hospital closures, right and left" in rural areas. He added: "And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded. Something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the results of racial voters suppression." Sen. Bernie Sanders said that under his Medicare For All plan, "We will have health care for all people in all parts of this country."9:10 p.m.Elizabeth Warren interjected during a discussion about housing to call on the candidates to address racial disparities such as "red lining," which prevented African Americans from buying homes for decades, and left an enduring legacy of inequality around the country.9:05 p.m.Pete Buttigieg hit Bernie Sanders for not supporting ending the filibuster, a Senate rule that, if ended, would allow bills to be passed with only a simple majority.“I want to come back to the question of the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took. This is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds,” Buttigieg said.Then, he delivered a direct line: “How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change?”Sanders has said he supports filibuster reform, but does not support getting rid of the rule.8:57 p.m.Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg were in a heated exchange over electability when Elizabeth Warren interrupted them to support Sanders' "progressive agenda."Sanders argued that he can beat President Donald Trump and will do so with "an unprecedented, grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian people who are standing up and fighting for justice."8:55 p.m.Mike Bloomberg, touting the millions he spent to help elect Democrats to the House in 2018, came close to saying that he “bought” the race, but caught himself and said, “I got them.”“They talk about 40 Democrats” that were elected to deliver a Democratic majority in 2018, Bloomberg said. “Twenty-one of those were people they spent $100 million to help elect.”8:50 p.m.Pete Buttigieg echoed the fears some Democrats have about nominating Bernie Sanders, using a back-and-forth with the Vermont senator to warn that a candidate at the top of the ticket who self-identifies as a “democratic socialist” could hurt down ballot races for the House and Senate.Buttigieg said nominating Sanders would lead to “four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate in Democratic hands.”8:45 p.m.Joe Biden and Tom Steyer attacked each other’s records on race in a tense exchange as the two men vie for the support of African American voters in South Carolina ahead of Saturday’s primary. Biden lambasted the billionaire businessman for investing in private prisons.“They hog-tied young men in prison here in this state. They, in fact, made sure that in Georgia they did not have health care for the people that were being held,” he said. “You wrote the crime bill,” Steyer shot back, referencing the 1994 legislation signed into law by former President Bill Clinton and noting that it had imposed stiff mandatory minimum sentences that had left hundreds of thousands of black and brown people in jail.8:35 p.m.Elizabeth Warren took aim with Michael Bloomberg over reports he told a female employee, who told him she was pregnant, to "kill it."Bloomberg denied having made the comment, responding with: "I never said that."Warren also hit Bloomberg for backing Republican senator, Scott Brown, she challenged and defeated in 2012. The Massachusetts senator first brought up Bloomberg's support for Sen. Pat Toomey, who narrowly held off Democratic challenger Katie McGinty in 2016."He dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific," Warren said of the McGinty. Then Warren turned to her own race."In 2012, (Bloomberg) scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger," Warren said. "That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard."8:25 p.m.Joe Biden criticized Bernie Sanders for his votes against the Brady Bill in 1993 and reports that the Vermont senator considered a primary campaign against then-President Barack Obama in 2012 — which Sanders denies. Biden said he’d sought a longer waiting period before handgun purchases in the Brady Bill than what Sanders had supported. He noted that the debate was taking place within walking distance of the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the site of a 2015 massacre at which a white supremacist gunman left nine dead.“I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon had the waiting period been what I suggested,” Biden said. 8:15 p.m.Bernie Sanders said the economy is “doing really great” for billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, and said his own campaign is about creating an “economy for all.”He said billionaires have seen an increase in wealth in the last several years, while many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.“For for the ordinary American, things are not so good,” Sanders said. “That is not an economy that's working for the American people. That's an economy working for the 1%. We're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors."8:10 p.m.Candidates began to spar onstage, notably but not unexpectedly, targeting Sen. Bernie Sanders, the front-runner in the Democratic primary.  Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden all took aim at the Vermont senator.8:00 p.m.Candidates take the stage for the South Carolina debate.                        Bernie Sanders' Democratic rivals unleashed a new wave of attacks against the party's presidential front-runner in a high-stakes debate Tuesday night, perhaps their final prime-time opportunity to change the direction of the 2020 nomination fight.

He then turned to Michael Bloomberg, who had moments earlier said he could work with the Chinese government because its leader is responsive to its "politburo."     "I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have a real dictatorship there," Sanders said. Turning back to Cuba, Sanders said "of course" it was a dictatorship but argued that he hadn't gone any farther in praising it than former President Barack Obama did during his efforts to open up relations with the country during his second term. "What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and health care," Sanders said. "That was Barack Obama." 9:40 p.m. The global spread of the coronavirus came up during tonight's debate. The candidates were asked how they would address the growing epidemic as president. Responding first, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, "What we have to do is make sure we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help." The Minnesota Democrat encouraged people who feel sick to keep checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website because she said "many doctors are just saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here." Former Vice President Joe Biden talked about his experience dealing with the Ebola outbreak during his time in the Obama administration.     "I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. What we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office on diseases that are pandemic diseases. We increased the budget of the CDC, we increased the (National Institutes of Health) budget. Our President today, he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it." Biden attacked President Trump for cutting funding to the CDC. Sen. Bernie Sanders echoed that criticism of Trump. He also went after the president for his comments that the coronavirus will stop spreading once the weather gets warmer.     "In the White House today, we have a self-described great genius — self-described — and this great genius has told us that this coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical date that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined — I wish I was kidding, that is what he said." 9:25 p.m. Michael Bloomberg said he would support decriminalizing marijuana, though he wants to see its legality expanded by the states “very slowly.” “We should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount.

South Korean coronavirus cases jump again, first US soldier infected
.W
The number of new coronavirus cases in South Korea jumped again Wednesday and the first U.S. military soldier tested positive.

South Korean coronavirus cases jumped again Wednesday and the U.S. military confirmed its first case among soldiers based in the Asian country, with his case and many others connected to a southeastern city with an illness cluster.South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 216 of the 284 new cases were in Daegu, where the government has been mobilizing public health tools to contain the spread of the outbreak, and in neighboring towns.The U.S. military said the 23-year-old soldier was in self-quarantine at his off-base residence. He had been based in Camp Carroll in a town near Daegu, and visited both Carroll and nearby Camp Walker in recent days, according to the statement.South Korean authorities and U.S. military health professionals were tracing his contacts to determine if other people may have been exposed.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea. United States Forces Korea previously said a widowed dependent had the virus, the first case involving a USFK-related individual. South Korea’s 600,000-member military has reported 18 cases and quarantined thousands of soldiers as a precaution.Bowling alleys, movie theaters and a golf course at four U.S. bases were closed after the soldier's case was confirmed, Col. Edward Ballanco, commander of the U.S. Army Garrison Daegu, said. All restaurants at the bases, and at Camp George in Daegu, could now provide only takeout meals with soldiers and family members prohibited from dining there, he said."This is a setback, it's true, there's no getting around that, but it's not the end of the war," he said on a video message posted on Facebook.“We are very well-equipped to fight this thing off. I am certain that, that soldier that has tested positive, he's on his way up to Camp Humphreys today, is going to get better medical care than anyone else in Korea who has the coronavirus.”South Korea now has 1,146 confirmed infections of the virus and 11 fatalities from the COVID-19 illness it causes. The national government has been channeling medical personnel, protective suits and other supplies to Daegu, and there are concerns the local hospitals are being overwhelmed and fatigued doctors are becoming vulnerable to infections.“This week will be critical in the fight to combat the illness,” Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu City Hall to discuss quarantine efforts.The number of cases were expected to rise as health workers finish testing hundreds of members of the Daegu branch of a church that has the country's biggest cluster of infections. The Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which mainstream Christian organizations describe as a cult, provided a list of 212,000 members nationwide to government authorities who plan to widen the screening. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said authorities plan to find and test churchgoers exhibiting symptoms first.South Korea’s virus patients also include a 25-year-old cabin crew member of Korean Air, the country’s biggest airline, who worked on a flight that departed from Israel and arrived in South Korea on Feb. 16, according to Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the KCDC. The flight also carried a group of tourists, of which 30 have tested positive.China, by far, still has the most cases and deaths from the illness, though its daily increase in cases has slowed recently. Chinese officials Wednesday reported another 406 cases and 52 additional deaths, all of them in hard-hit Hubei province and all but 10 in the epicenter of the city of Wuhan.China has recorded 2,715 deaths from COVID-19 and 78,064 confirmed cases of the virus on the mainland since the illness emerged in December.China has put Wuhan and nearby cities under virtual quarantine for weeks, halting nearly all movement except for disease prevention, health care and supplying necessities. It has sent thousands of personnel to build and staff virus-dedicated hospitals in the epicenter region. In the capital Beijing and throughout the country, public events were canceled and factories, offices and schools closed.Chinese banks have been ordered to disinfect old banknotes before reissuing them to the public. State broadcaster CCTV showed staff of a state-owned bank in Shanghai putting old banknotes under ultraviolet disinfection and putting them into a vault. The bank told CCTV money removed from high-risk sites such as hospitals and markets would not be returned to circulation. Other banknotes will be disinfected and sealed for at least 7 days before being recirculated, the bank said.Uncertainty remained over how best to stem the spread of the illness. Italy had taken Europe’s most stringent preventative measures and yet became home to the biggest outbreak outside Asia. Experts in Japan acknowledged the mishandling of a virus-stricken cruise ship could have allowed the problem to magnify.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday downplayed the assertion by International Olympic Committee veteran member Richard Pound the fast-spreading virus could cancel the Tokyo Olympics set to open in July. Pound said organizers face a three-month window to decide the fate of the games.Suga said Pound's opinion does not reflect the official view of the IOC. Suga said the IOC and local organizers are going ahead as planned with the Tokyo Olympics.Several Middle Eastern countries reported jumps in cases tied to travel from Iran, which has the highest in the Middle East with 95 cases and 15 deaths. Kuwait's KUNA news agency said 12 cases have been confirmed there, and Bahrain's state-run news agency said it had 26 cases.Japan's total of 861, third highest behind China and South Korea, includes 691 from the Diamond Princess. Four former passengers on the ship have died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus. Six government officials involved in the quarantine effort also became sick.Overnight, 445 Filipinos who were mostly crew members on the ship flew home to begin a 14-day quarantine. Eighty Filipinos from the ship have the virus and stayed behind in hospitals in Japan.

China has recorded 2,715 deaths from COVID-19 and 78,064 confirmed cases of the virus on the mainland since the illness emerged in December. China has put Wuhan and nearby cities under virtual quarantine for weeks, halting nearly all movement except for disease prevention, health care and supplying necessities. It has sent thousands of personnel to build and staff virus-dedicated hospitals in the epicenter region. In the capital Beijing and throughout the country, public events were canceled and factories, offices and schools closed. Chinese banks have been ordered to disinfect old banknotes before reissuing them to the public. State broadcaster CCTV showed staff of a state-owned bank in Shanghai putting old banknotes under ultraviolet disinfection and putting them into a vault. The bank told CCTV money removed from high-risk sites such as hospitals and markets would not be returned to circulation. Other banknotes will be disinfected and sealed for at least 7 days before being recirculated, the bank said. Uncertainty remained over how best to stem the spread of the illness. Italy had taken Europe’s most stringent preventative measures and yet became home to the biggest outbreak outside Asia. Experts in Japan acknowledged the mishandling of a virus-stricken cruise ship could have allowed the problem to magnify. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday downplayed the assertion by International Olympic Committee veteran member Richard Pound the fast-spreading virus could cancel the Tokyo Olympics set to open in July. Pound said organizers face a three-month window to decide the fate of the games. Suga said Pound's opinion does not reflect the official view of the IOC. Suga said the IOC and local organizers are going ahead as planned with the Tokyo Olympics. Several Middle Eastern countries reported jumps in cases tied to travel from Iran, which has the highest in the Middle East with 95 cases and 15 deaths. Kuwait's KUNA news agency said 12 cases have been confirmed there, and Bahrain's state-run news agency said it had 26 cases. Japan's total of 861, third highest behind China and South Korea, includes 691 from the Diamond Princess. Four former passengers on the ship have died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus. Six government officials involved in the quarantine effort also became sick. Overnight, 445 Filipinos who were mostly crew members on the ship flew home to begin a 14-day quarantine. Eighty Filipinos from the ship have the virus and stayed behind in hospitals in Japan.

Jimmy John's sandwich item linked to new E. coli outbreak
.W
The chain stopped serving clover sprouts at all of its restaurants as of Tuesday.

The Food and Drug Administration warned Jimmy John's customers Wednesday about an E. coli outbreak following other health concerns with the sandwich restaurant chain that were recently noted.The FDA said customers who ate clover sprouts should monitor their symptoms and contact their health care provider if they have experienced common foodborne illness symptoms.Those symptoms could include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, nausea or vomiting.“If consumers have a leftover sandwich with clover sprouts from Jimmy John’s, do not eat it and throw it away," Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response Frank Yiannas said in a statement.The chain stopped serving clover sprouts at all of its restaurants as of Tuesday.The new outbreak is "likely linked to clover sprouts" at restaurants in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Texas and Utah, according to the FDA.Those cases aren't related to a warning letter the department recently issued to the company. "But they do underscore the seriousness of the issue as we work with Jimmy John’s to prevent outbreaks like these in the future," Yiannas said.The FDA issued the letter, saying certain vegetables Jimmy John's served were implicated in five outbreaks of E. coli or salmonella in the past seven years.The letter accuses the chain of engaging in a pattern of receiving and selling "adulterated fresh produce, specifically clover sprouts and cucumbers.""Jimmy John's restaurants have been implicated in multiple outbreaks that have spanned the past seven years and impacted consumers in no fewer than 17 states," Yiannas said in a news release Tuesday."Jimmy John's has not demonstrated implementation of long-term sustainable corrections to its supply chain to assure the safety of ingredients used in its products," he said."Food safety is our top priority. ... This removal (of sprouts) was out of an abundance of caution and was not initiated by any known, immediate threat," Jimmy John's President James North said Tuesday..The FDA previously said it also sent a warning letter to a supplier of Jimmy John's. The supplier, the FDA said, provided spouts to the restaurant chain that the administration says sickened 22 people in Iowa late last year with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.According to the FDA letter, the four other outbreaks were:• A salmonella outbreak that had infected 10 people as of Feb. 28, 2018, in Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Eight had eaten sprouts on Jimmy John's sandwiches, and one ate sprouts bought at a grocery store.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected 19 people as of August 2014 in California, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, Utah and Washington. Most reported eating clover sprouts in the week before becoming sick, and Jimmy John's was determined to be a likely source in some cases, the FDA said.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected eight people by the end of October 2013 in Colorado. All had eaten raw cucumbers from one of three Jimmy John's restaurants in the Denver area, the FDA said.• An E. coli outbreak that had infected 29 people in 11 states as of April 5, 2012.

Coronavirus vaccine test opens as US volunteer gets 1st shot

U.S. researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday — leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.

U.S. researchers gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday — leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.With a careful jab in a healthy volunteer’s arm, scientists at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle begin an anxiously awaited first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe.“We’re team coronavirus now,” Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. “Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.”The Associated Press observed as the study’s first participant, an operations manager at a small tech company, received the injection inside an exam room. Several others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart.“We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,” said Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle.She's the mother of two teenagers and “they think it's cool” that she's taking part in the study.Monday’s milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine wouldn’t be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. That’s still important if the virus becomes a long-term threat.This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There’s no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don’t contain the coronavirus itself.It’s not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study -- in the U.S., China and South Korea -- next month.The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500.COVID-19 has upended the world’s social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other.Starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her team’s mood as “subdued.” They’ve been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the U.S. struck early and hard by the virus.Still, “going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine” in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson told The AP.Some of the study’s carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That’s why we’re doing a trial,” Jackson stressed. “It’s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.”Most of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named “spike” that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people won’t get infected.Researchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus’ genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that “messenger RNA” into a vaccine.The idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack -- and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus.That’s a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it.But because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate.“The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?” he told reporters last week.The Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before COVID-19 began spreading widely in Washington state.Kaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and aren’t currently sick. Researchers aren’t checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of COVID-19 before deciding if they’re eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study.

Amazon said Monday that it needs to hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders as the coronavirus spreads and keeps more people at home, shopping online.

Amazon said Monday that it needs to hire 100,000 people across the U.S. to keep up with a crush of orders as the coronavirus spreads and keeps more people at home, shopping online.The online retailer said it will also temporarily raise pay by $2 an hour through the end of April for hourly employees. That includes workers at its warehouses, delivery centers and Whole Foods grocery stores, all of whom make at least $15 an hour. Employees in the United Kingdom and other European countries will get a similar raise.“We are seeing a significant increase in demand, which means our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year,” said Dave Clark, who oversees Amazon’s warehouse and delivery network.Amazon said this weekend that a surge of orders is putting its operations under pressure. It warned shoppers that it could take longer than the usual two days to get packages. It also said it was sold out of many household cleaning supplies and is working to get more in stock.The Seattle-based company said the job openings are for a mix of full-time and part-time positions and include delivery drivers and warehouse workers, who pack and ship orders to shoppers.Amazon is already the second-largest U.S.-based employer behind Walmart, with nearly 800,000 workers worldwide.

At least 60 people have died from the virus.While children are out of school, here are some ways to keep them engaged from Save the Children.Stay on scheduleJust because they don’t have to beat the morning bell doesn’t mean your children should toss out the normal routine. Keep them in rhythm by sticking to regular wake times, bedtimes and meal times.Let them help plan the daySave the Children suggests encouraging your children to take an active role in the day’s agenda. Listen to their proposals and ideas and work collaboratively to construct a productive day.Use online learning resourcesEmbrace the power of online learning. Take advantage of any resources your child’s school provides online. If there aren’t any, search for age-appropriate learning tools and supervise your child’s progress. Keep their minds activeEncourage new ways for your children to learn through daily home activities like journaling, drawing and planting.Don’t forget to moveInactivity and socialization may decrease when children are home from school, Save the Children said. Make sure to designate some outdoor time or try low-impact exercises like yoga indoors.Make sure to eat rightTry to eat as healthy as you can. Have your children help prepare food when possible and teach them about nutrition during while you’re at it.Scholastic helping studentsAs schools across the nation close because of the coronavirus, millions of students are stuck at home with their classes on hold. But before your child gets too excited about not having to study, rest assured, parents, Scholastic has got your back.The educational company has launched a "Learn at Home" website that has daily courses for students from pre-kindergarten to grades six and higher. From learning about why zebras have stripes to math lessons based on K-Pop stars, Scholastic's learning plans cover all the subjects your student would be taking at school."As more and more teachers, students and families around the world are affected by the coronavirus, our priority is to support them in the best way we know how — by providing them with rich stories and meaningful projects that will keep kids academically active," Lauren Tarshis, senior vice president and editor-in-chief of Scholastic Classroom Magazines, said. The website, which is divided into four sections based on grade level, currently has five days' worth of content. An additional 15 days of content is on the way, Scholastic said in a news release.The courses provide approximately three hours of learning per day, including writing and research projects, virtual field trips and geography challenges.The website is accessible on any device that has internet, and no sign-up is required. It will remain free and open indefinitely, Scholastic said.For more on how parents can homeschool kids during the outbreak, click here             MONTEREY, Calif.

Companies stressed that their online stores would remain open.

A growing number of retailers have announced they are temporarily closing stores in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Nike, Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch and more have announced that they are shuttering many or all of their retail stores around the globe through late March because of coronavirus. They followed makeup brand Glossier and outdoor brand Patagonia, which Thursday and Friday were among the first consumer goods retailers to announce temporary store closures.The companies all stressed that their online stores would remain open, though some, including Patagonia, have said shipments could be delayed as employees work remotely.Apple last month closed retail locations in China during the peak of the outbreak there. On Friday, the company said that while its China locations had reopened, it was closing stores in all other areas of the world.President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus Friday. As of Sunday, over 3,000 coronavirus cases had been reported in the United States, while more than 150,000 cases have been reported globally. Health experts have encouraged people to respond by practicing "social distancing," which includes avoiding large gatherings and maintaining a physical distance of about six feet from other people."What we've learned together (in China) has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response," Apple said in a statement Friday. "One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus's transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we're taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers."Many retailers have also closed offices and asked employees who work in other parts of the business to work from home.Some of the largest grocery chains in the United States — including Kroger, Publix and Walmart — have also announced reduced store hours in response to the outbreak.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 that have announced store closures:Glossier:All stores closed as of March 12, for at least the next two weeks.Hourly employees will continue to receive their regular pay for the two week scheduled closure.The company has also delayed the opening of its new Arizona store, which was scheduled for this upcoming Wednesday.Patagonia:All stores closed as of March 13.

The company linked to half of the state's cases of coronavirus is donating millions to support global response efforts and communities around the world impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Biogen is donating $10 million to address immediate critical needs, with the majority of donations going to support nonprofit organizations in the U.S., including Massachusetts and North Carolina, in Italy and in other impacted countries worldwide. The donation will be used to help expand testing options, ease the strain on medical systems, provide training for frontline health workers and support access to necessities like food, Biogen said. The company has also provided medical equipment and supplies to Partners HealthCare in Massachusetts, to help diagnose COVID-19 in a greater number of people. Biogen will also be supporting Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital directly as they work on the front line to treat and contain the virus.More than 100 of the COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts are in some way connected to a Biogen conference that was held in Boston last month. The Boston Marriott Long Wharf, where the conference was held, closed indefinitely as a result of its connection to the outbreak.              CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

One weird side effect of the coronavirus shutdown: A new world aviation record is set.

The aviation industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with travelers across the world dealing with canceled flights and travel bans as they scramble to get home.But one unlikely aviation side effect is the creation of a new world aviation record.On March 14, French airline Air Tahiti Nui flew the longest ever scheduled passenger flight by distance —transiting 9,765 miles across the world from Papeete, in Tahiti, French Polynesia, to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport.This one-off milestone was a direct consequence of the coronavirus-induced U.S. travel restrictions.This route usually involves a scheduled stopover at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). But when an airplane stops over in the U.S., all passengers must alight the aircraft and proceed through U.S. Customs and Border Protection before they're allowed to advance on with the next leg of their journey.Current restrictions rendered this part of the journey untenable, so instead, flight TN064 just carried straight on, departing at 3 a.m. local time from Papeete airport and arriving in Paris at 6:30 a.m. local time on March 15.Exceptional situation"This flight was operated on an exceptional basis and within the constraints imposed by the American authorities in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic," an Air Tahiti Nui spokesperson told CNN Travel in a statement.The flight, which was airborne for just under 16 hours, became the world's longest commercial flight in terms of distance traveled.The flight overtook the previous record held by Singapore Airlines, which offers a scheduled passenger service between Singapore and Newark covering a distance of 9,534 miles.Australian carrier Qantas set a different record for the longest flight late in 2019. Its experimental Project Sunrise test flight clocked up about 11,060 miles and 19 hours and 19 minutes nonstop between London and Sydney. But since there were no fare-paying passengers aboard, it doesn't count as a properly scheduled service.Related: Chaos at Chicago's O'hare Airport as European travelers returnTN064 is also the world's longest scheduled domestic flight, because it traveled between French Polynesia and mainland France.Air Tahiti Nui tells CNN Travel the aircraft flew with a "reinforced crew" of four pilots, and was operated by a "next generation aircraft" a Boeing 787-9, twin-engine Dreamliner.The aircraft was reportedly nowhere near full, which meant it was able to proceed the full stretch without refueling.One-off record holderAir Tahiti Nui says it was an "exceptional flight, operated in a special context," and adds it demonstrates the airline's commitment to keeping up transit links between France and the overseas territory."But is not destined to be perpetuated," adds the spokesperson.That's right, it's a one-off.Since the weekend, the airline's been substituting its usual stopover in Los Angeles with touchdowns in Vancouver, Canada or Pointe a Pitre, in Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe — although the Canadian option's now been ruled out as the north American country introduced a travel ban on March 16.

Japan to close schools nationwide to control spread of coronavirus
.W
The decision comes amid growing concern about the rise in the number of untraceable cases of the virus in Japan.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked all elementary, middle and high schools nationwide on Thursday to close until late March to help control the spread of coronavirus in the country.The request caught many local officials by surprise. While not legally binding, it is expected to be largely followed. It will affect 12.8 million students at about 34,800 schools nationwide, according to the education ministry.“The coming week or two is an extremely important time,” Abe said. “This is to prioritize the health and safety of the children and take precautions to avoid the risk of possible large-scale infections.”The decision comes amid growing concern about the rise in the number of untraceable cases of the virus in northern Japan and elsewhere. Japan now has more than 910 cases, including 705 from a quarantined cruise ship. An eighth death from the virus was confirmed Thursday on the northern island of Hokkaido.Abe's announcement came hours after several local governments had announced their own decisions to suspend classes for shorter periods.Officials in Hokkaido said they were closing all 1,600 elementary and middle schools. Hokkaido now has 54 confirmed cases, the largest in in the country outside the cruise ship.Some local governments quickly said they will abide by the request, but others criticized the short notice and said it would affect working parents who need to find sitters for young school children.“Society will fall apart because of the measures,” said Chiba Mayor Toshihito Kumagai, adding that he will come up with measures to support working parents during the school suspension.Japan's school year ends in March, leaving little time for final exams or graduation ceremonies.Schools should keep exams and graduation ceremonies to minimum and take all necessary precautions, Abe said.“Our graduation ceremony is coming up soon, and it's quite a hectic time of the year,” Norinobu Sawada, vice principal of Koizumi Elementary School in Hokkaido's Kitami City, told a Japanese television station. “The most important thing is to prevent infections, so there aren't many other options.”The Japanese government has also asked companies to allow employees to work flexible hours or work from home to reduce infection risks.

Health officials say a man in California has tested positive for coronavirus, the seventh confirmed case in the nation.

Health officials say a man in California has tested positive for coronavirus, the seventh confirmed case in the nation. The County of Santa Clara Public Health Department said it received the confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are two other confirmed cases of coronavirus in California, two in Illinois, one in Arizona and one in Washington.The United States on Friday declared a public health emergency because of a new virus that hit China and has spread to other nations.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also announced that President Donald Trump will temporarily bar entry to the U.S. of foreign nationals believed to be a risk of transmitting the virus. The new restrictions begin Sunday afternoon. “The risk of infection for Americans remains low and with these and our previous actions we are working to keep the risk low,” Azar said. Americans returning from Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine. Others returning from elsewhere in China will be allowed to self-monitor their condition for a similar period. The U.S. will also begin funneling all flights to the U.S. from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened for illness.On Friday, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines announced they were suspending all flights between the U.S. and China, joining several international carriers that have stopped flying to China as the virus outbreak continues to spread.The virus has infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, a troublesome sign that prompted the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global emergency. The death toll stood at 213, including 43 new fatalities, all in China.              SANTA CLARA COUNTY, Calif.

Health officials in Massachusetts say the virus has been confirmed in a Boston man in his 20s who was returning from Wuhan, China.

Officials with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus in the state Saturday.Health officials said a Boston man in his 20s is confirmed to have the virus after he recently traveled to Wuhan, China. The DPH and the Boston Public Health Commission were notified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the positive test results late Friday evening.The man sought medical care soon after his return to Massachusetts, according to officials. He has been isolated since that time and will continue to remain isolated until he is cleared by public health officials. “We are grateful that this young man is recovering and sought medical attention immediately,’’ said Dr. Monica Bharel, Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner. "Massachusetts has been preparing for a possible case of this new coronavirus, and we were fortunate that astute clinicians took appropriate action quickly. Again, the risk to the public from the 2019 novel coronavirus remains low in Massachusetts.” Officials said his few close contacts have been identified and are being monitored for any sign of symptoms.“Our priority is not only to protect and inform the residents of Boston, but also to help this man continue to recover. We are pleased that he is doing well,” said BPHC Executive Director Rita Nieves. “Right now, we are not asking Boston residents to do anything differently. The risk to the general public remains low. And we continue to be confident we are in a good position to respond to this developing situation.”This is the eighth case of the Wuhan coronavirus in the United States: three people in California, two in Illinois — a husband and wife — and one person each in Massachusetts, Washington State and Arizona.On Friday, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the 2019 novel coronavirus a public health emergency and ordered any American citizens returning from the center of the outbreak in China to be quarantined for two weeks as a precaution. This followed a declaration Thursday by the World Health Organization that the coronavirus outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus has resulted in thousands of confirmed cases of human infection in more than 20 countries, with more than 99% of the cases in China.The DPH said the risk to the public from the virus remains low in Massachusetts.

'I Was Training for the Olympics. Now I Have No Clue What the Future Holds.'
.W
When your job is to compete against other people, and health officials advise avoiding contact, what is an Olympian to do?

After months of training and qualifying competitions, U.S. fencer Race Imboden was on track to compete for his country at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. But like everyone, his plans were thrown into limbo with the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and now the 26-year-old athlete and two-time Olympian has no idea what the future holds. He and his teammates can't get back to Italy, where they usually train; their gyms in California have closed; the remaining Olympic qualifying events have been postponed; and it remains to be seen whether the Games themselves will be canceled, pushed back, or held as planned.On a phone call from Palm Springs, CA California — shortly after learning his L.A. training facility has closed to prevent transmission of the virus — Imboden (spaces needed between em dashes) told Men's Health about the uncertainty he and other Olympic hopefuls are experiencing during the pandemic. His story has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Last weekend, we all flew back to California — all the fencers in the world. A good thousand people, plus the people around them, like coaches. We had our last Olympic qualifying competition ... and it's canceled.  Our team is pretty much locked down — we know the guys going. But the problem is, there are a lot of countries  come out of this competition, and you're now in limbo. It's a really crazy time in all sports. We're talking to friends who flew to San Diego to be in BMX: canceled. Ice skating: canceled. All my friends were in the same position: a deadly limbo, which is the worst place to be in sports. We work off motivation, and right now the motivation for everyone is the Olympic Games. Now we're three months out, and people are really trying to make the best of the last steps of preparation, and it's completely ground to a halt. They just closed fencing clubs and gyms in L.A. We don't even have a place to train now. We were still going to the gym until , knowing it was risky. We were cleaning equipment, washing our hands, not touching our faces while we were lifting — just kind of dealing with the fact that we don't know if there's going to be a competition in one month, two months — we can't get out of shape now. In the news, we keep seeing that  will happen, but I'm becoming more and more scared it just won't. There's too much to do. There are so many events that have to happen for people to qualify.

I think it's gonna start hitting athletes hard. We wake up every morning, and we have no idea what to do. Where to go. How to train. What's going to happen. Are we even going to be competing  in ? It went from an absolute definitive — we definitely are qualified — to just being all question marks. We have no idea if our coach  is going to have to go home.  We definitely know we have to stay in shape and continue to train, but it's becoming more difficult. We're a combat sport, and we need multiple sparring partners.

Sports are always something that are an addition to your life. Sports are supposed to bring pleasure, so when life is going wrong, it's not the right time, anyway. We have to take care of each other.As an athlete, I have to think  going to happen. I continue to work the best I can.At the beginning, I was firmly , there's no way ... I believed they would have this under control, and it's turning into something I believe no one has control over.  That light at the end of the tunnel seems to be fading at the moment.                         After months of training and qualifying competitions, U.S. fencer Race Imboden was on track to compete for his country at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. But like everyone, his plans were thrown into limbo with the outbreak of the  COVID-19 coronavirus , and now the 26-year-old athlete and two-time Olympian has no idea what the future holds. He and his teammates can't get back to Italy, where they usually train; their gyms in California have closed; the remaining Olympic qualifying events  have been postponed ; and it  remains to be seen  whether the Games themselves will be canceled,  pushed back , or held as planned. On a phone call from Palm Springs, CA California — shortly after learning his L.A. training facility has closed to prevent transmission of the virus — Imboden (spaces needed between em dashes) told  Men's Health  about the uncertainty he and other Olympic hopefuls are experiencing during the pandemic. His story has been edited and condensed for clarity.                                Advertisement                       Last weekend, we all flew back to California — all the fencers in the world. A good thousand people, plus the people around them, like coaches. We had our last Olympic qualifying competition ... and it's canceled.   Our team is pretty much locked down — we know the guys going. But the problem is, there are a lot of countries [whose teams] come out of this competition, and you're now in limbo.  It's a really crazy time in all sports. We're talking to friends who flew to San Diego to be in BMX: canceled. Ice skating: canceled. All my friends were in the same position: a deadly limbo, which is the worst place to be in sports. We work off motivation, and right now the motivation for everyone is the Olympic Games. Now we're three months out, and people are really trying to make the best of the last steps of preparation, and it's completely ground to a halt. They just closed fencing clubs and gyms in L.A. We don't even have a place to train now.  We were still going to the gym until [March 15], knowing it was risky. We were cleaning equipment, washing our hands, not touching our faces while we were lifting — just kind of dealing with the fact that we don't know if there's going to be a competition in one month, two months — we can't get out of shape now.  In the news, we keep seeing that [the Olympics] will happen, but I'm becoming more and more scared it just won't. There's too much to do. There are so many events that have to happen for people to qualify. It seems like we’re going into, what? A month of lockdown in the U.S.?

'Blown away by their kindness': Mom asks for birthday cards for kids as they self-quarantine
.W
People from all corners of the world designed cards. They then took a picture of their card and sent the photo to the mother so she could create a special birthday message for her children.

Mona Helgeland was sad for her children. Their birthdays were coming up but they were self-quarantined because of the coronavirus and are going to miss celebrating with friends and family.So, the Norwegian single mother of two went on Facebook groups and asked people to send greeting cards. She said she has been “blown away by the kindness.” In just a few days since that first post, she has received dozens of cards from across the world, from Alaska to South Africa."It's beautiful. I started crying," Helgeland, 37, said about the cards that some have posted with drawings of her son's favorite Japanese cartoon characters, or cows, zebras and hearts, as well as photos from the studio where they make the Harry Potter films that her children love.To Helgeland, who has a painful spinal joint disorder called ankylosing spondylitis, the message during these uncertain times is clear: “It’s important to stay positive and take care of each other and spread love, not just the virus.”Tens of millions of people were hunkered down Tuesday. Countries across the globe shut their borders, and cities locked down, closing schools and businesses to try to curb the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 190,000 people and killed more than 7,500.The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems. More than 80,000 people have recovered from the illness.Amid the grim news Helgeland has seen goodness, one card at a time."They're making the effort, going out of their way for someone they don't even know,” Helgeland said in an interview via videoconferencing. “I'm blown away by their kindness."Helgeland lives with her family in Ålgård, about 300 miles southwest of the Norwegian capital of Oslo. The town is best known for an amusement park, its wood and textile industries and for being the birthplace of Havard “Kickalicious” Rugland. The placekicker's YouTube video in 2012 went viral and led to several tryouts with NFL teams.Norway recently announced measures to try to halt the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 1,400 people and killed three in the Scandinavian country. King Harald V, several members of the royal family and some government members have protectively been put in quarantine because they had traveled abroad in recent weeks.Helgeland had been planning the birthdays of her children: Kristine, who will turn 17 on March 26, and Vetle, who will be 14 on April 6. Instead, the three of them are isolated at home.“They’re so scared,” she said about how news of the virus has affected them. “I wanted to do something to cheer them up.”Over the weekend, she wrote notes and posted them on Facebook groups, including “Little love notes from around the world!” and one called “ Random Acts of Kindness.” She told people about the chronic illness that she has had for 10 years, the isolation during the virus outbreak and about her family: how her daughter loves cows and dogs and the “Outlander” TV show; how “My Hero Academia” is her son’s favorite cartoon.“Hi everyone! Hope you all are safe and well with everything happening around the world. I want to ask you a favour,” she said in her note where she asked for a card for her kids. “I want to make their birthdays something to remember with joy,” she said. “And hope to make them both a "love/happy birthday from around the world-note.”The photos of the cards started coming in, one after the other from all corners of the world. Her favorite? “Oh my God, I love them all,” she said. “They’re all special.”There’s one with the photo of a tiny, florescent green iguana from Jacksonville, North Carolina and another with a giant brown moose from Sterling, Alaska. One is a cartoon of a man in a kilt next to his dog from Scotland. Several include landmarks and landscapes, a sunset from Idaho, the “Plaza de Armas” square of Veracruz, Mexico and a dog on a beach in Melbourne, Australia. One with a cartoon cow reads: “Dear Kristine, your mother’s love is so big that this ‘moooooosage’ came from Alberta, Canada.”Savannah Foster, 33, from Collinsville, Illinois sent Kristine a hand-drawn card with a birthday cake and for Vetle, some stars. She first read Helgeland’s message in the Facebook group “Little love notes around the world,” and the women have kept in touch and said they have become friends.“Just knowing how far a mother would go for her kids. It’s just the small things, but there’s love. That moved me,” said Foster, who recently put a message on Facebook offering toilet paper rolls for the elders in her town. “It says that no matter where you are, we are people and as long as we stick together, the world can be OK,” she said. “It is hope. There’s definitely hope.”                        Mona Helgeland was sad for her children.

Movie theaters close nationwide, Disney postpones 'Black Widow'
.W
U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown.

U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. With most of Hollywood's March and April releases already postponed, the Walt Disney Co. on Tuesday also cleared out its May releases as well, including Marvel's “Black Widow.” The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed its upcoming release plans and guidelines for social distancing steadily diminished the recommended size of crowds. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close altogether. AMC said the latest guidelines made movie theater operations “essentially impossible.” It said it would close all locations in the U.S. for at least six to 12 weeks. Regal, the second-largest chain, said Monday that its theaters would close until further notice. Disney also indefinitely postponed “Black Widow," which had been set to open May 1. Marvel movies have for years been the regular kickoff to the summer movie going season. The company also put off the releases of “David Copperfield" (May 8) and “The Woman in the Window” (May 15). With movie theaters locked down for the foreseeable future, some studios took the extraordinary step of funneling new or recently released films onto home viewing platforms. Universal Pictures said Monday it will make its current and upcoming films available for on-demand rental, becoming the first major studio to break the traditional theatrical window of 90 days due to the pandemic. The studio said it will put movies currently in theaters — “Invisible Man,” “The Hunt” and “Emma”— up for rental as early as Friday. It also said that “Trolls World Tour," one of the only major releases left on the April calendar, will debut in theaters and on-demand services simultaneously. A 48-hour rental will cost $19.99.Most of Europe's cinemas have already shut down, as have those in China, India and elsewhere. North America's shutdown came gradually. On Sunday, the mayors of New York and Los Angeles ordered their cities' theaters closed. Governments in Massachusetts and Quebec also closed theaters. Cinemark, the nation's third-largest chain, announced it would close, along with other chains like the Alamo Drafthouse, Landmark Theatres, Showcase Cinemas and Bow Tie Cinemas. Most of those that haven't yet declared themselves closed are expected to do so this week. New York's Film Forum marquee, usually adorned with titles, instead bore a paraphrased Franklin Roosevelt quotation: “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” The Alamo Drafthouse put an “Intermission” card up on its website. “This news – this situation – is devastating,” the 41-theater circuit based in Austin, Texas, wrote. “When we re-open after this unprecedented and indefinite hiatus, it will be in a dramatically altered world, and in an industry that’s been shaken to its core." Over the weekend, ticket sales plunged to their lowest levels in at least 20 years at U.S. and Canadian theaters. Not since a quiet September weekend in 2000 has weekend box-office revenue been so low, according to data firm Comscore. Universal's move could be seen as either a watershed moment for Hollywood or an aberration due to extreme circumstances. With few exceptions, the major studios have guarded the 90-day exclusivity window even as digital newcomers like Netflix and Amazon have challenged it. For the studios, box office still is the primary revenue generator. Last week, the Motion Picture Association said worldwide ticket sales reached $42.2 billion last year.The National Association of Theater Owners, the trade group that represents movie exhibitors, made its first statement on the shutdowns Tuesday, acknowledging the hardship facing movie theaters but also pledging that the theatrical window will resume once the crisis has passed. The organization said speculation that this will permanently expand home streaming of Hollywood studio productions “ignores the underlying financial logic of studio investment in theatrical titles.”“To avoid catastrophic losses to the studios, these titles must have the fullest possible theatrical release around the world,” the association said in a statement. “While one or two releases may forgo theatrical release, it is our understanding from discussions with distributors that the vast majority of deferred releases will be rescheduled for theatrical release as life returns to normal.” NBCUniversal is prepping its own streaming service, dubbed Peacock, but it isn't set to launch until July 15. On Sunday, Disney made “Frozen 2” available on its streaming service, Disney Plus. But that film had already completed its theatrical run. Its digital release didn't break the traditional 90-day theatrical exclusivity window.And Hollywood's major upcoming releases aren't currently heading for the home; they're being held for when theaters reopen. Paramount Pictures' “A Quiet Place Part II," earlier slated for release Friday, has been removed from the schedule. Disney's “Mulan" and the James Bond film “No Time to Die” have been put off. Universal earlier pushed its latest “Fast and Furious” movie, “F9,” from late May to April of next year.While the new coronavirus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and people with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover. In addition to advising against gathering of more than 10 people, Trump has urged all older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to stay home.

"It's a step I hoped that I'd never have to take," Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. "But I can't allow one person who we know has this virus to refuse to protect their neighbors."

A Kentucky novel coronavirus patient checked himself out of the hospital against medical advice. So to prevent him from spreading the virus, officials are surrounding his house to keep him there.The 53-year-old man in Nelson County refused to quarantine himself after testing positive for COVID-19, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.Nelson County officials "forced an isolation" on the man, one of the first 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state."It's a step I hoped that I'd never have to take," Beshear said in a conference on Saturday. "But I can't allow one person who we know has this virus to refuse to protect their neighbors."Beshear didn't share then how the government had forced the unnamed man to stay in his home.But this week, Nelson County Sheriff Ramon Pineiroa told the Kentucky Standard that deputies will be parked outside of the man's home for 24 hours a day for two weeks. The patient is cooperating now, Pineiroa said.When reached for comment by CNN, the Nelson County Sheriff's Department deferred all comments to Beshear. Most state laws for imposing quarantines are fairly broad. Kentucky law gives the Cabinet for Health and Family Services the power to declare and "strictly maintain" quarantine and isolation as it sees fit, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.The federal government hasn't authorized national quarantines or isolations yet, but President Donald Trump has that power. Under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, a president can issue an executive order authorizing isolation or quarantine for several contagious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndromes like COVID-19.

"The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or Republican...

A reason to get out of jail? Inmates fearful of coronavirus argue for release
.W
"I truly believe the jails are ticking time bombs," said David Patton, executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York. "They're overcrowded and unsanitary in the best of times."

Coronavirus has become a "get out of jail" card for hundreds of low-level inmates across the country, and even hard-timers are seeking their freedom with the argument that it's not a matter of if but when the deadly illness sweeps through tightly packed populations behind bars.Among those pleading for compassionate release or home detention are the former head of the Cali drug cartel, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff and dozens of inmates at New York City's Rikers Island, part of a jail system that lost an employee to the virus this week.Related video above: Inside look at efforts to prevent coronavirus spread in Massachusetts jails"He is in poor health. He is 81 years old," David Markus, the attorney for cocaine kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela, wrote in emergency court papers this week seeking his release after serving about half of a 30-year drug-trafficking sentence. "When (not if) COVID-19 hits his prison, he will not have much of a chance." While widespread outbreaks of coronavirus behind bars have yet to happen, the frenzy of legal activity underscores a crude reality that's only beginning to sink in: America's nearly 7,000 jails, prisons and correction facilities are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, as dangerous as nursing homes and cruise ships but far less sanitary. Stepped-up cleanings and a temporary halt to visitations at many lockups across the country in the midst of the crisis can't make up for the fact that ventilation behind bars is often poor, inmates sleep in close quarters and share a small number of bathrooms. "Simply put, it's impossible to do social distancing," said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami.The 81-year-old Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence for bilking thousands of investors in a $17.5 billion Ponzi scheme, had just asked last month to be released early in light of his terminal kidney disease. Now his attorney is calling on all at-risk federal prisoners to be released for their own safety because of the coronavirus."The federal prison system has consistently shown an inability to respond to major crises," Madoff attorney Brandon Sample told The Associated Press. "My concerns are even more amplified for prisoners at federal medical centers and those who are aged."Prosecutors argued against Rodriguez-Orejuela's emergency request and noted the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, where both he and Madoff are being held has not had any staff or inmates diagnosed with the virus, and staff are being screened upon entry. It's not just attorneys for the wealthy and powerful seeking releases. In New York, public defenders asked judges to release older and at-risk inmates from the city's beleaguered federal jails, saying pretrial confinement "creates the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease." The motions cite a provision of the Bail Reform Act allowing for the temporary release of pretrial inmates under "compelling" circumstances. "I truly believe the jails are ticking time bombs," said David Patton, executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York. "They're overcrowded and unsanitary in the best of times. They don't provide appropriate medical care in the best of times, and these certainly are not the best of times." Some authorities around the nation appear to agree. Police departments are incarcerating fewer people, prosecutors are letting non-violent offenders out early and judges are postponing or finding alternatives to jail sentences. In Los Angeles, the nation's largest jail system has trimmed its population by more than 600 since Feb. 28, allowing many inmates with fewer than 30 days left on their sentences to be released early. In Cleveland, judges held a special session over the weekend to settle cases with guilty pleas and release more than 200 low-level, non-violent inmates. And in Miami, the top state attorney has urged the release of all non-violent felons and those being held on misdemeanors."No judge wants to have a dead prisoner on his conscience," said Bill Breeze, a Miami defense attorney.New York City's Board of Correction this week called for the immediate release of all high-risk inmates after an investigator assigned to the jail system died over the weekend of the coronavirus. The 56-year-old man was said to have a pre-existing health condition and only limited contact with inmates. The city's jail system has about 8,000 inmates, most at notorious Rikers Island.However, accommodating the surge of requests poses its own challenge. Courts around the country are shutting down, with only a skeletal staff working. The chief federal judge in Brooklyn on Monday postponed indefinitely all criminal and civil jury trials, encouraging judges to conduct court business via telephone or video conferencing when possible, and to delay in-person proceedings. Prosecutors said in court filings the Federal Bureau of Prisons has been planning for the outbreak since January, including by establishing a task force with experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The BOP on Friday suspended visitation for all federal inmates, facility transfers, staff travel and training for 30 days. Newly arriving inmates are being screened for COVID-19, and even asymptomatic inmates deemed to be at risk are being quarantined. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that they would take similar steps.

The Twitter account of Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney who is serving a three-year sentence for crimes including tax evasion and campaign finance violations, shared over the weekend an online petition seeking the transfer of non-violent federal prisoners to home confinement. Addressed specifically to Trump, it argues the move would "give the prison facilities additional (and much-needed) medical triage and logistic space for those who will become infected.""Without your intervention, scores of non-violent offenders are at risk of death," it reads, "and these people were not given a death sentence."

A viral image circulating on social media falsely claims gargling water with salt or vinegar "eliminates" the coronavirus.

People are putting their Christmas lights back up as a sign of hope amid coronavirus fears

As COVID-19 continues to spread and the need for social distancing increases, Twitter users are calling for people to put their Christmas lights back up as a sign of hope.

With home isolation increasing, social distancing in place, restaurants and venues partially or temporarily closing, events being canceled, some cities in total lockdown, and people sadly dying from the virus, people in every corner of the world are being impacted by COVID-19.The need for a light at the end of the tunnel is especially significant, which is why a call to get the Christmas lights back out is taking the internet by storm. And it seems like the nation is embracing a return to festive decor. Well, if you're going to be stuck in your home, you might as well make it look pretty. Like Twitter user @lanegrindle suggests, if everyone put their lights up, driving around to look at Christmas lights is a safe activity to enjoy while social distancing. Plus, it's a great distraction for kids who are not at school. For others, though, hanging Christmas lights represents so much more. As Twitter user @lisastregis shares, the lights serve as a sign of hope in a particularly dark time. Lisa recounts how an elderly neighbor asked a friend's husband to turn on their Christmas lights because of the darkness in the world right now. They obliged and "there are bright dancing Christmas lights now on in their neighborhood." She ends her post with #CoronaKindness, a reminder for all of us to show a little extra love in these trying times.  Other Twitter users are making a similar call, asking everyone to make their own light in a time of darkness.

Meet some of the volunteers participating in a coronavirus vaccine trial
.W
The vaccine trial started Monday and is expected to last for six weeks.

Neal Browning and Jennifer Haller are stepping up in a big way to help researchers find a vaccine to combat the coronavirus pandemic.The two are in a group of 45 healthy individuals who have volunteered for a coronavirus vaccine trial in Washington state.They each spoke to CNN Tuesday about why they chose to take part in the trial.Speaking with CNN's Brooke Baldwin, Browning said he's doing it to "make this end as quickly as possible for the rest of the world," adding, "If I'm healthy enough to be able to contribute research and hoping you find a vaccine sooner than later, why wouldn't I?"Haller said it was easy decision for her."I am so privileged in my life to be healthy and to have family and friends around," she told CNN's Chris Cuomo. "I work for a company that allows the flexibility to take time off and to work remotely whenever I need. I just have a huge privilege that I can do those things.""And so so many Americans right now do not have that privilege and are concerned about paying rent, certainly losing their jobs, how they're going to feed their family. There's so much that other people are worried about right now."She said she feels "blessed" she has the opportunity to do something that might bring change."We all feel so helpless right now," she said. "And I actually am getting to do something here."The trialThe vaccine trial, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, started Monday and is expected to last for six weeks. It is run at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19.Phase I of the trial is meant to establish the vaccine is safe and induces a desired response from participants' immune systems. Proving that the vaccine is effective in preventing coronavirus infection, however, will require follow-up studies involving many more participants, which will take many more months.The first step was making sure everyone was healthy, Browning said."Everyone went through a physical, blood draws, tests to make sure that everyone looked good; after that we were administered vaccine," he said.There is no actual virus in this vaccine, Brown was told, "They're using a new technique that basically teaches cells in my body to build protein structures that resemble the outer shell of the actual coronavirus. My body should react to that and see it as a foreign invader, attack it and learn how to combat that structure that's been built."Haller says she received her first vaccine Monday morning and had a follow-up phone call Tuesday and expects another on Wednesday. She'll go in for a blood draw in a week and have another draw done the week after that. And in about a month, she'll receive her second shot and go through that process again.Meanwhile, Browning said he keeps a daily chart that includes information about his temperature, any potential side effects or any other factors of concern. Then each week, he gets blood drawn."We then get blood drawn to look and make sure the body is reacting the way it's expected to, producing the antigens that hopefully will allow us to combat coronavirus should we become exposed to it," Browning said.He'll also go for a second dose a month after he received his first one, along with more monitoring and blood draws.Browning said he didn't tell his family he was going to volunteer for the study until the last minute, and now they think it's "pretty cool that Dad's doing something like this.""I think it's important for them to learn that as a member of society, you need to help do whatever you can, but also that there's 44 other people as part of the study," he said. "It's not just Dad out there trying to make the world a better place."Haller said she hopes what is happening in the country serves as a wake-up call."This is a great opportunity for us to kind of wake up and to step out of that little bit and start thinking about others and having concerns for others and what they're going through at this time."

Police departments across the nation are changing how they respond during the coronavirus outbreak
.W
Here's what some police departments are doing to contain the spread of the virus in their precincts.

As the new coronavirus pandemic continues to affect nearly every area of life, law enforcement agencies around the country are changing the ways they respond to service calls to reduce officers' contact with possible carriers of the virus.Police officers and other law enforcement personnel come into contact with countless people in their communities on any given day. Now that this highly contagious disease is spreading across the U.S., their jobs carry a new risk -- both for officers themselves and for the communities they serve.Here's what some police departments are doing to contain the spread of the virus in their precincts.Some departments are closing their front desksMany police departments are asking residents to report nonemergency incidents online or over the phone.The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that it is closing the front desks and walk-up service at area stations beginning Wednesday. Instead of visiting stations in person, the department advises that the public email those front desks."Rest assured, we will still respond to crimes in progress or a crime in need of immediate follow up, as Watch Commanders will dispatch patrol officers to those incidents," the statement reads.Police departments in the California towns of Bakersfield and Delano also said they were closing their front lobbies, according to KGET.Some say they won't respond to nonurgent callsThe Syracuse Police Department in New York said it would not be responding to nonemergency calls, which would instead be directed to its phone or online reporting systems.Authorities in Arlington County, Virginia, tweeted a graphic on Monday advising the public to use its online reporting system for incidents including credit card fraud, theft, harassing phone calls, vandalism or vehicle tampering.The department said its officers were continuing to patrol around the county and would still respond to in-progress crimes or emergencies where there is "an immediate threat to life, health or property."Among other departments that have issued similar guidance are the Belmont Police Department in California, the Grand Junction Police Department in Colorado and Ann Arbor Police in Michigan.In Lyndhurst, New Jersey, the police department said officers would take reports for certain nonemergency calls over the phone, such as those that don't require an investigation on the scene or the collection of evidence."We feel that because our officers interact with many people throughout the day, limiting as much exposure as possible will aid us in contributing to our social distancing responsibility to the public," the department said in a news release.The Pensacola (Florida) Police Department put it in more blunt terms."We're going to do you a solid. We're not going to bring germs to you," the department wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday, adding that it would take reports for incidents that didn't require officers to be physically present over the phone."This 1) saves us one of dozens of face-to-face contacts that have the potential to spread the virus, and 2) does not require you to get dressed and brush your teeth because you are having guests (us)," the department continued."So, we will still respond to your call, just not in person. If you NEED us to come to you, we will do that just as we have for almost 200 years. But we'd prefer if you at least put on pants."Officers are practicing social distancingWhen officers do have to respond in person, many of them will be following social distancing protocols and other guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Arlington County Police Department said that people who report or witness emergency incidents could be asked to step outside to speak to officers. Officers, meanwhile, might be wearing gloves, masks or goggles.In New Jersey, the Lyndhurst Police Department said that officers who have to make in-person visits will keep a "safe distance" and refrain from shaking hands.The CDC says that law enforcement personnel who make in-person visits should protect themselves from COVID-19 exposure by maintaining a distance of at least six feet, practicing proper hand hygiene and not touching their face.People who might have the virus should be transported to healthcare facilities by emergency medical service personnel or technicians rather than law enforcement, according to CDC guidelines.For law enforcement personnel who must make contact with people who are confirmed or suspected to have the virus, the CDC recommends they wear appropriate personal protective equipment.

Sixty-five years after 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi, the House has approved legislation designating lynching as a hate crime under federal law.The bill, introduced by Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush and named after Till, comes 120 years after Congress first considered anti-lynching legislation and after dozens of similar efforts were defeated.The measure was approved 410 to 4 on Wednesday. The Senate unanimously passed virtually identical legislation last year, although that bill wasn't named for Till. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill, which designates lynching as a federal hate crime punishable by up to life in prison, a fine, or both.Rush, a Democrat whose Chicago district includes Till's former home, said the bill will belatedly achieve justice for Till and more than 4,000 other lynching victims, most of them African Americans.Till, who was black, was brutally tortured and killed in 1955 after a white woman accused him of grabbing her and whistling at her in a Mississippi grocery store. The killing shocked the country and stoked the civil rights movement.“The importance of this bill cannot be overstated,'' said Rush, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. ”From Charlottesville to El Paso, we are still being confronted with the same violent racism and hatred that took the life of Emmett and so many others. The passage of this bill will send a strong and clear message to the nation that we will not tolerate this bigotry. "Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who represents the area where Till was abducted and murdered, called the anti-lynching bill long overdue, but said: "No matter the length of time, it is never too late to ensure justice is served.''House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., used similar language to urge the bill's passage. “It is never too late to do the right thing and address these gruesome, racially motivated acts of terror that have plagued our nation’s history,'' he said, urging lawmakers to "renew our commitment to confronting racism and hate.''The bill was unanimously supported by Democrats. Three Republicans — Louie Gohmert of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ted Yoho of Florida — opposed the bill, along with independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.Gohmert said he supported the bill's concept, but preferred that those accused of lynching in Texas be tried in state court, where they could face the death penalty.Massie said he opposed the expansion of federal hate-crime laws. “A crime is a crime, and all victims deserve equal justice,'' he said in a statement. ”Adding enhanced penalties for ‘hate’ tends to endanger other liberties such as freedom of speech.”Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, called lynching a lasting legacy of slavery.“Make no mistake, lynching is terrorism,'' she said. ”While this reign of terror has faded, the most recent lynching (in the United States) happened less than 25 years ago.''Although Congress cannot truly rectify the terror and horror of these acts, Bass said, a legislative body that once included slave owners and Ku Klux Klan members will belatedly "stand up and do our part so that justice is delivered in the future.''Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey applauded House passage of the bill, which mirrors legislation they co-sponsored in the Senate along with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. The three are the Senate's only black members.“Lynchings were horrendous, racist acts of violence,” Harris said in a statement. "For far too long Congress has failed to take a moral stand and pass a bill to finally make lynching a federal crime. This justice is long overdue.”Booker called lynching “a pernicious tool of racialized violence, terror and oppression” and “a stain on the soul of our nation.'' While Congress cannot undo lynching's irrevocable damage, ”we can ensure that we as a country make clear that lynching will not be tolerated,” Booker said.Congress has failed to pass anti-lynching legislation nearly 200 times, starting with a bill introduced in 1900 by North Carolina Rep. George Henry White, the only black member of Congress at the time.Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said passage of the anti-lynching legislation "marks a milestone in the long and protracted battle against white supremacy and racial violence in our country.''The bill "makes clear that lynchings occupy a dark place in our country’s story and provides recognition of thousands of victims of lynching crimes,” including Till and many others, Clarke said.

CDC confirms first US coronavirus case of 'unknown' origin; California monitors over 8,000 people
.W
U.S. health officials say an apparently unprecedented coronavirus suggests it may be spreading under the radar.

For the first time, a U.S. patient has contracted novel coronavirus with no clue as to where it came from.The California patient didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.That means this could be the first U.S. case of "community spread" of the virus, when the source of the infection is unknown.California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at least 8,400 people have been monitored locally.The patient is being treated in Sacramento County.The patient is at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, according to a statement from the hospital. The statement was posted on behalf of UC Davis Medical Center Interim CEO Brad Simmons and UC Davis Health Vice Chancellor Dr. David Lubarsky.According to the statement, the patient was transferred to the hospital on Feb. 19."When the patient arrived, the patient had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition," the statement said. "Since the patient arrived with a suspected viral infection, our care teams have been taking the proper infection prevention (contact droplet) precautions during the patient’s stay."The team at UC Davis Medical Center asked public health officials if the case could be the novel coronavirus and requested testing by the CDC. At this time, neither Sacramento County nor CDPH are doing coronavirus testing. "Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19, a test was not immediately administered. UC Davis Health does not control the testing process," the statement said.The CDC ordered the coronavirus test on Sunday, put on airborne precautions and strict contact precautions "because of our concerns about the patient’s condition." The letter said the CDC confirmed Wednesday the patient's coronavirus test came back positive. The CDC said the case was confirmed through the public health system in Northern California -- picked up by "astute clinicians."California health officials said, “Contact tracing in this case has already begun.”"At this time, the patient’s exposure is unknown," the CDC said. "It’s possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States." “This would be the first known instance of person-to-person transmission in the general public in the United States,” CDPH said in a statement. “Previously known instances of person-to-person transmission in the United States include one instance in Chicago, Illinois, and one in San Benito County, California. Both cases were after close, prolonged interaction with a family member who returned from Wuhan, China and had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus. As of today, including this case, California has had seven travel-related cases, one close contact case, and now one community transmission.”According to the UC Davis Health statement, this is not the first coronavirus patient at UC Davis Medical Center."Because of the precautions we have had in place since this patient’s arrival, we believe there has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center," the statement said. Federal officials have been working closely with state and local partners to respond to this "public threat.""Unprecedented, aggressive efforts have been taken to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of this virus," the CDC said.“California has a strong health care system and public health infrastructure,” CDPH said in a statement. “California has prepared for the potential spread of diseases, such as H1N1, in the past and is prepared and actively responding to the potential community spread of COVID-19." California health officials said the health risk from the coronavirus to the general public remains low.“While COVID-19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate," the CDPH said. "From the international data we have, of those who have tested positive for COVID-19, approximately 80 percent do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization. There have been no confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States to date. California is carefully assessing the situation as it evolves.”According to the CDC, there are now 15 cases of coronavirus that have been confirmed within the U.S.:12 cases were travel-related2 cases were person-to-person spread1 case (the case confirmed Wednesday) was community spreadThe total number of people tested for the coronavirus within the U.S., as of Tuesday, is 445.CNN contributed to this report.

Tokyo's Disney parks to close for two weeks over coronavirus
.W
The closure comes in the wake of a request by Japan's government to cancel or postpone big gatherings and events over the next few weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Disney is closing down its theme parks in Japan as the novel coronavirus outbreak in that country escalates.Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea will shut down on Saturday and stay closed through March 15, the parks' operator Oriental Land announced on Friday.The closure comes in the wake of a request by Japan's government to cancel or postpone big gatherings and events over the next few weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The virus has killed eight people in Japan, and sickened more than 900, the vast majority of them connected to the a cruise ship that became a floating quarantine zone off of Yokohoma earlier this month. Worldwide, there are at least 2,800 deaths, mostly in mainland China, and more than 83,000 global cases, with infections on every continent except Antarctica. The Tokyo resort said it will refund guests for admission fees and hotel bookings. It said the park, for now, is scheduled to reopen on March 16.The Tokyo closures are the latest business headache for Disney in Asia. The company closed its theme parks in Shanghai and in Hong Kong last month over coronavirus fears, just before the Lunar New Year holiday.Earlier this month, Disney warned that those closures, along with fallout from Hong Kong's mass protests, could carve $280 million in profit from the current quarter.The company added that the coronavirus will hurt its results for the fiscal year as a whole.For now, the properties in Hong Kong and Shanghai are closed indefinitely, and "the precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures," Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on an earnings call earlier this month.

9th US case of new virus confirmed in San Francisco Bay Area
.W
The coronavirus has already killed more than 200 people.

A woman in the San Francisco Bay Area who became ill after returning from a trip to China has become the ninth person in the U.S. to test positive for a new virus, health authorities said Sunday.It's the second coronavirus case announced in Santa Clara County in as many days but the two cases are not related, according to the county Public Health Department.The woman, a visitor to the U.S., had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. She arrived Jan. 23 to visit family, officials said in a news release.She has stayed home since she arrived, except for two times to seek outpatient medical care. She has been regularly monitored and was never sick enough to be hospitalized.“A second case is not unexpected. With our large population and the amount of travel to China for both personal and business reasons, we will likely see more cases, including close contacts to our cases," said Dr. Sara Cody, the county's health officer.The first case in the Bay Area was a man who traveled to Wuhan and Shanghai before returning Jan. 24 to California, where he became ill, Cody said Friday.The man was never sick enough to be hospitalized and "self-isolated" by staying home, she said.The man left home twice to seek outpatient care at a local clinic and a hospital. Public health officials are now trying to reach anyone he may have come into contact with during those times to assess whether they were exposed to the virus.Those people, along with the few members of his household, will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine.Health officials believe it can take up to two weeks for someone who is infected to get sick.The virus has infected almost 10,000 people worldwide and killed more than 200. The vast majority of the cases and all but one of the deaths have been in China. The first death outside China from the new virus was recorded Sunday in the Philippines.Cody said there was no risk of infection for the general public from the Santa Clara County cases.Nearly 200 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan are under a 14-day quarantine at a military base outside Los Angeles — the first by the government in half a century.Other cases of the new pneumonia-like virus include two in Southern California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona and two in Chicago.

'No reason for Americans to panic': White House looks to calm fears over coronavirus
.W
The White House is seeking to calm coronavirus fears, saying the nation is at "low risk."

National security adviser Robert O'Brien on Sunday said at this time "there's no reason for Americans to panic" about the Wuhan coronavirus, saying the threat is "low risk" in the United States."Right now, there's no reason for Americans to panic. This is something that is a low risk, we think, in the US," he said during an interview on CBS' "Face The Nation," adding that the virus is a "top priority" for President Donald Trump and the administration is "taking steps to keep Americans safe."There are more than 16,000 confirmed cases of the virus globally, and more than 200 people have died. All but one of the deaths have been in mainland China. Eleven cases have been confirmed in the U.S.In comparison, the 2019-2020 flu season is projected to be one of the worst in a decade, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The flu virus has infected 19 million Americans across the country and killed at least 10,000 people this season alone.The White House on Thursday announced a coronavirus task force that "will lead the Administration's efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the virus." It is lead by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and includes members from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Homeland Security and others.On Saturday, the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved a request to provide military housing for up to 1,000 people who may need to be quarantined upon arrival in the United States from overseas travel due to concerns about possible infection of the virus.Countries are now sending planes to evacuate their citizens from the infection zone, and imposing travel bans or restrictions on travelers from China. DHS announced it will begin enforcing travel restrictions set to go into effect Sunday evening in an effort to contain the virus outbreak."These steps will also expedite the processing of U.S. citizens returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people," DHS Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf said in a statement. "We realize this could provide added stress and prolong travel times for some individuals, however public health and security experts agree these measures are necessary to contain the virus and protect the American people."Nearly 60 million people are under lockdown in Chinese cities as international researchers race to develop a vaccine and halt its spread.                        National security adviser Robert O'Brien on Sunday said at this time "there's no reason for Americans to panic" about the Wuhan coronavirus, saying the threat is "low risk" in the United States.

Eleven cases have been confirmed in the U.S.                                                                                                       9th US case of new virus confirmed in San Francisco Bay Area                          In comparison, the 2019-2020 flu season is projected to be one of the worst in a decade, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The flu virus has infected 19 million Americans across the country and killed at least 10,000 people this season alone. The White House on Thursday announced a coronavirus task force that "will lead the Administration's efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the virus." It is lead by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and includes members from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Homeland Security and others. On Saturday, the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved a request to provide military housing for up to 1,000 people who may need to be quarantined upon arrival in the United States from overseas travel due to concerns about possible infection of the virus. Countries are now sending planes to evacuate their citizens from the infection zone, and imposing travel bans or restrictions on travelers from China. DHS announced it will begin enforcing travel restrictions set to go into effect Sunday evening in an effort to contain the virus outbreak. "These steps will also expedite the processing of U.S. citizens returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people," DHS Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf said in a statement. "We realize this could provide added stress and prolong travel times for some individuals, however public health and security experts agree these measures are necessary to contain the virus and protect the American people." Nearly 60 million people are under lockdown in Chinese cities as international researchers race to develop a vaccine and halt its spread.

The coronavirus is a viral respiratory illness that was first identified in Wuhan.

According to California's San Benito County Public Health Department, there are two confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the county. According to public health officials, the confirmed cases are a husband and wife. They are both 57 years old. The husband recently traveled from Wuhan, China. The wife picked up the virus from her husband. These new patients bring the total number of confirmed cases to 11 in the United States. Some key points noted by health officials:If you have not been to China, or been in close contact with someone who has been to China and is sick, your risk is very low. CDC guidance indicates that people who have casual contact with a case (in the same grocery store or movie theater) are at minimal risk of developing infection. If you have recently been to China and feel sick, please: Stay home and avoid contact with others. Contact your doctor’s office or emergency room and tell them about your recent travels and symptoms. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.San Benito County Public Health Services said it is in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health.The coronavirus is a viral respiratory illness that was first identified in Wuhan.The first case of person-to-person spread in the United States was reported in late January. Similar to other viral infections, coronavirus is spread through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.              SAN BENITO COUNTY, Calif.

What a 20% unemployment rate would mean for America

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin suggested that 32 million Americans could be out of work unless Congress takes action due to the effects of the coronavirus on the U.S.

On Tuesday in a meeting with Republican senators, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned that unless Congress takes action to deal with the massive economic impact of the coronavirus, the country could see unemployment soar to as high as 20% — meaning that 32 million Americans could be out of work.While Mnuchin made clear this was just one of a number of possible scenarios and Congress seems poised to pass a massive stimulus bill as soon as Wednesday, it's worth thinking about the impact of a 20% unemployment rate.The coronavirus has already had devastating effects on the U.S. with over 100 deaths, major losses on Wall Street and daily lives disrupted amid widespread shutdowns from schools to restaurants and businesses.Meanwhile, jobless claims are surging across the U.S. after governmental officials ordered millions of workers, students and shoppers to stay at home as a precaution against spreading the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.In Ohio, more than 48,000 people applied for jobless benefits during the first two days of this week. The tally during the same period the prior week: just 1,825.In neighboring Pennsylvania, about 70,000 people sought unemployment aid in a single day — six times the total for the entire previous week.“We’ve been getting flooded with calls,” said John Dodds, director of the nonprofit Philadelphia Unemployment Project. “It's going to be a big mess, a double mess: illness and unemployment.”The growing number of people filing for unemployment checks raises fresh questions about whether states have stockpiled enough money since the last recession to tide over idled workers until the crisis ends. Some fear the demand for help could outpace the states' ability to pay claims.“Our unemployment insurance fund is getting hit pretty hard right now,” said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, where coronavirus-related jobless claims accelerated from zero to nearly 18,000 in barely one week.Video: New Hampshire unemployment claims spike as people seek help amid COVID-19 crisisRaimondo, a Democrat, said the state already needed to start replenishing its fund and appealing for help from the federal government, which she said needed to “step up.”President Donald Trump's administration is proposing an economic stimulus package that could approach $1 trillion and include sending checks to Americans within a matter of weeks to help them pay for groceries, bills, mortgages and rent. A separate aid bill pending in Congress could inject $1 billion into state unemployment insurance programs.The federal aid could rival or exceed that of the Great Recession in 2008, when a financial industry crisis led to widespread layoffs. Economic analysts warn the country is likely entering — or already in — its first recession since then.The last recession led to the insolvency of unemployment trust funds in 35 states that collectively racked up more than $40 billion of debt to keep paying unemployed workers. In many states, those debts were repaid through higher taxes on employers.To shore up their trust funds, some states also cut the amount and duration of benefits for those who became unemployed in the future."States aren’t really recession-ready, because it’s so hard for people to get benefits, stay in the program, and the benefits are insufficient,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a New York-based group that advocates for low-wage workers and the unemployed.Are states prepared with unemployment benefits?In the U.S., state unemployment trust funds generally are in better financial shape than they were before the last recession. Yet 21 states began the year with less than the amount recommended to remain solvent in an average recession, according to a U.S. Department of Labor report. At the bottom of the solvency list are many of the most populous states — California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio and Massachusetts.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, was among the first to shut down schools, sporting events and certain businesses because of the coronavirus. Unemployment claims have since skyrocketed.DeWine's administration acknowledged that state lawmakers likely will have to intervene to shore up the state's shaky unemployment trust fund.“The workers out there should not be worried. It will be funded for their needs," said Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, also a Republican.Pennsylvania in January finally made the last payment on billions of dollars of bonds issued in 2012 to cover the unemployment fund debt from the last recession. But its fund remains in danger of insolvency, according to the U.S. Department of Labor report.In Tennessee, new unemployment claims tripled over the past week. Michigan received four times as many jobless claims as had been expected on the first day of this week.Warnings to stay away from public gathering spots also have made it more complicated to apply for benefits, with some state unemployment offices closed to the public. Instead, they have shifted more applicants from offices to websites and phone calls, but even those systems are being taxed.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the number of unemployment insurance requests was so high at the start of this week that it crashed the state labor department's website.New York's labor department said it's experiencing “an unprecedented increase” in calls and online visits for unemployment benefits. During the first half of Tuesday, it had 110,000 website visits and 21,000 phone calls. That's 2 1/2 times the web traffic and 10 times the phone calls of the entire previous Tuesday. At times, the surge was too much for the agency to handle.Governors and lawmakers in many states took action this week to make unemployment benefits easier and quicker to get. Some also waived rules that disregard the first week of unemployment or extended the total number of weeks people can be eligible.In North Carolina, which offers less in jobless benefits than most states, displaced workers won't have to be actively looking for a new job, as is required for traditional benefits, and employers who must lay off workers won't be financially responsible for the benefits their workers receive.Kansas lawmakers worked quickly Tuesday to pass legislation that eliminates a one-week wait to begin receiving benefits and expands their duration from 16 to 26 weeks. But House Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Republican, expressed concern that the economic problems caused by the virus pandemic could deplete the state's unemployment fund in less than a year, even though it's ranked in the top quarter nationally."What we are seeing is something totally unique here, where the switch has flipped from historically low claims numbers to a dramatic escalation that's going to affect multiple segments of the economy," said Kansas Deputy Department of Labor Secretary Brett Flachsbarth.What's happened in the past with high unemployment rates?But while major unemployment rates have occurred, the country has some examples of extremely high unemployment rates in the past and the ability to persevere.The only time the unemployment rate has been over 20% in modern American history was in a four-year period from 1932 to 1935 — right in the teeth of the Great Depression. During that time, the unemployment rate peaked at 24.9% in 1933. By December of 1936, the unemployment rate had dropped to 16.9%.After years of single-digit unemployment rates, it wasn't until 1982 when the unemployment rate again skyrocketed — back up to 10.8% in December of that year — amid a recession that actually began in 1981. By 1984, however, the recession was over, unemployment dipped back to 7.3% in December. Then came the financial crisis of 2008. Unemployment that year was 7.3% in December, but the failures of major Wall Street banks that fall suggested massive volatility in the labor market.

Big 3 automakers closing factories amid coronavirus fears

The United Auto Workers union has been pushing for factories to close because workers are fearful of coming into contact with the coronavirus.

Ford and General Motors are confirming that they will temporarily close all of their North American factories due to the coronavirus threat.Fiat Chrysler will do the same, according to two people briefed on the matter Wednesday.Ford said its plants will shut down after Thursday evening shifts, through March 30, while GM said it will begin a “systematic orderly suspension” of production through at least March 30. Operations will be evaluated weekly after that.Messages were left seeking comment from Fiat Chrysler. The people speaking about the closures didn't want to be identified because formal announcements had not yet been made.“We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep our plant environments safe, and recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement.Ford said in its statement that it will work with leaders of the United Auto Workers union in the coming weeks on plans to restart factories, as well as exploring more procedures to prevent the virus from spreading. The union has been pushing for factories to close because workers are fearful of coming into contact with the virus.The companies' decisions reverse a deal worked out late Tuesday in which the automakers would cancel some shifts so they could thoroughly cleanse equipment and buildings, but keep factories open.

The company said a plant worker tested positive for the coronavirus but had not been to work in over a week. One shift was sent home Tuesday night and the plant was cleaned. But that apparently didn't satisfy workers, and two more shifts were canceled on Wednesday.Ford said it closed an assembly plant in the Detroit suburb of Wayne, Michigan, on Wednesday after a worker there tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

They likely will receive supplemental pay in addition to state unemployment benefits. The two checks combined will about equal what the workers normally make.Automakers have resisted closing factories largely because they book revenue when vehicles are shipped from factories to dealerships. So without production, revenue dries up. Each company has other reasons to stay open as well. Ford, for instance, is building up F-150 pickup inventory because its plants will have to go out of service later this year to be retooled for an all-new model.Despite the plant closures by other automakers, electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc.'s assembly plant in Fremont, California, remained open Wednesday. Production continued even though Alameda County on Tuesday night declared it a “nonessential business" under the county's shelter-in-place order.Seven Bay Area counties have ordered nearly 7 million residents to shelter in place for three weeks and ordered businesses to send employees home in order to slow spread of the coronavirus.

Fighting fear with beer: Coronavirus spurs curbside beer sales

Where one door shuts, another door may open, and breweries are finding that's a car door.

Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. But with the new coronavirus popping up all over the country, a trip to your favorite taproom isn’t in the offing. So breweries are stepping up, offering curbside growlers to stave off the grumbling. Amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued an executive order Tuesday closing all restaurants and bars, except for takeout. But instead of grumbling, Tar Heels are growling. A number of other states around the country have put similar measures in place. But where one door shuts, another door may open, and breweries are finding that's a car door. White Street Brewery in downtown Wake Forest is offering curbside service for people who bring in growler bottles to be filled with its signature tap beers. It also offers 2-pint cans called “crowlers.” Taproom manager Rene Betancourt says the gesture is the brewery's way of showing appreciation for customers while helping to stem the spread of COVID-19.“Beer isn’t a necessity,” she says. “But … beer is a social thing. So, the fact that we’re having to distance ourselves from each other, and those opportunities are being taken away, I think that is affecting a lot of people." For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority recover in several weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness, including pneumonia.To help customers make up for some of the fun they're missing from prohibited barroom gatherings — and to give a boost to flagging business — Austin Beerworks in Texas posted a photo of brightly colored cans and bottles stacked up at a new makeshift drive-thru. “In accordance with new rules, our taproom is now only able to offer Beer-To-Go," the brewery said in a tweet. "We set up a drive through tent and are working on preordering online.” Wolf Creek Brewery in Valencia, California, tweeted,  “The brewery/tasting room may be closed for on premise fun; however, you can head on over to @wolfcreekscv for drive through 6-packs, merch, and some delicious food!”Meanwhile, beer drinkers in Alabama rejoiced when the state's ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control) Commission on Tuesday issued an emergency rule  allowing curbside sales of unopened alcohol at restaurants and bars. ⁣The move came as the state shut down 78 state-run liquor stores throughout Alabama. In Wake Forest, podiatrist Jim Judge usually comes to White Street a couple of times a week. So, he popped in to pick up three crowlers to take home. “Beer is up there with whiskey — which I can’t get here,” he said, when asked where the suds ranked on his list of necessities. “Absolutely above toilet paper right now. Without a doubt.”                        Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.

Gambling shuts down in Vegas under governor's virus order
.W
Gambling has been halted for a month in Nevada, shutting down casinos on the Strip.

Casinos throughout Nevada were closed Wednesday, along with other nonessential businesses, following an unprecedented order from Gov. Steve Sisolak. He urged residents to stay home to help curtail the spread of the new coronavirus.After gambling halted at midnight, pedestrians on the casino-lined Las Vegas Strip were scarce. Vehicle traffic was flowing Wednesday afternoon but lighter than usual. Large orange barricades were placed in front of driveways to the Wynn and Encore casinos, while gates blocking walkways and entrances to a nearby shopping mall had been chained and padlocked. Across the street, a chain-link fence had been placed in front of the Circus Circus resort.Sisolak ordered a monthlong freeze on gambling by Wednesday, shutting down not only the the well-known casinos of Las Vegas and Reno but all gambling machines, like slot machines found in grocery stores and convenience stores.The broad directive also included the monthlong closure of nonessential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms at noon Wednesday. Restaurants must shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery.During a news conference Tuesday night, Sisolak described some of the business he wanted closed within less than a day and which ones he'd like to stay open. On Wednesday, an hour after his noon deadline ordering businesses to close, the governor released a list of businesses considered essential and nonessential.The closures are part of federal guidance recommending social distancing. President Donald Trump has urged Americans to follow sweeping guidelines for the next few weeks, including for older residents to stay home and for all people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people as well as restaurants and bars.Nevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus, including one death. For most people, coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.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 addition to casinos, Sisolak said salons, gyms, nightclubs, bars, bowling alleys, movie theaters and malls were among the businesses that should close.

Medical students launch program to offer child care to hospital workers fighting coronavirus
.W
The students provide health care workers with some of the things they need most at the moment, ranging from child or pet care to grocery and pharmacy runs.

As the war against the merciless coronavirus rages on, health care workers nationwide are on the front line of an unpredictable battle. While working tireless hours, those in the field often forgo their own needs.Now, one group of University of Minnesota Medical School students has decided to lend a hand -- not at the hospitals, but in the homes of health care professionals.They call themselves the MN CovidSitters. Their main job? To provide health care workers in the state with some of the things they need most at the moment, ranging from child or pet care to grocery and pharmacy runs.The initiative, which launched on Wednesday, pairs students with health care workers, including doctors, nurses, kitchen staff, janitors and hospital administrators across the entire state.The idea for the program, founded by UMN second-year medical students Sruthi Shankar and Sara Lederman, came after their university moved its classes online and canceled clinical rotations."As a medical student, it can be hard to feel so removed from everything that's going on in the world," Lederman told CNN. "Even once you're in the hospital, I think many medical students struggle to figure out how they can be most useful. One of the things that I hear my medical school peers ask a lot is, 'How can I help?' With the COVID-19 outbreak, that question felt not only more relevant, but more urgent. And not only does it take a village, but it takes a brilliant, humble, determined village."On Friday, Lederman began gathering volunteers, mostly medical, pharmacy and nursing students, while Shankar worked on compiling a list of health care workers in need of assistance.Within three days, the group had more than 280 student volunteers and more than 160 health care workers sign up for services.'Superheroes in disguise'While the students are currently matching volunteers to families using a Google form, the team is working on developing an app to automate the matching process. The group also developed a logo and website overnight."I've never met a lot of the people on this team and am convinced they are superheroes in disguise," Lederman said. "Everyone's superpowers are coming out. We are realizing so many of our classmates have incredible skills and talents that we didn't know about until now."Health care workers in need of assistance are asked to fill out a form to indicate what services are needed and how urgent the request is. The students then match and connect families with two to five health professional students to establish a solid schedule.Families are matched with volunteer students who live nearby, with each volunteer limited to a single family. This measure was put into place to follow health experts' recommendation that Americans practice "social distancing" to help combat the spread of coronavirus.In order to protect the students and the rest of the population from coronavirus transmission, the program does not assist workers who have experienced coronavirus symptoms in the past two weeks; traveled to a hot spot region such as China or South Korea; had contact with an individual diagnosed with coronavirus; or are not fully immunized.Volunteers must also log their hours so in case of coronavirus exposure, the team can easily track who was exposed and limit any further spread.From a Minnesota program to a nationwide initiativeSince the launch, the community support for the program has been "incredible," Shankar said.The MN CovidSitters initiative has also inspired many others to start similar initiatives. The Minnesota group has been working with more than 20 other groups across the globe -- including in England and Canada -- to help launch similar programs."We created a Google Drive with resources to get started and included some of the main roadblocks we've encountered," Angelina Omodt-Lopez, one of the administrators of MN CovidSitters, told CNN. "We hope people will continue to share that Google Drive if it helps speed up the process of establishing other programs."Omodt-Lopez said the growing interest in launching similar programs "demonstrates that health care workers across the world are in dire need of child-care assistance.""We hope that the resources we created will help others quickly establish similar programs," she said. "We also hope that once the app is created, it will be extremely efficient for other locations to implement this sort of program."The group is also directing all monetary contributions donated to MN CovidSitters to organizations, including food banks and homeless shelters, that serve Minnesota's most vulnerable populations.For many of the fourth-year medical students involved with MN CovidSitters, working on the initiative while dealing with the upheaval of their schoolwork has been far from easy.Graduation has officially been canceled, and Shankar said the students have been on a roller coaster of emotions, dealing with the "giant wave of disappointment" after being unable to work alongside their mentors and teachers.Still, she said, MN CovidSitters has been "a labor of love" in a time of uncertainty."So many of us have spent days not showering or eating, just to get this project off the ground so we can serve our community."

"We also hope that once the app is created, it will be extremely efficient for other locations to implement this sort of program." The group is also directing all monetary contributions donated to MN CovidSitters to organizations, including food banks and homeless shelters, that serve Minnesota's most vulnerable populations. For many of the fourth-year medical students involved with MN CovidSitters, working on the initiative while dealing with the upheaval of their schoolwork has been far from easy. Graduation has officially been canceled, and Shankar said the students have been on a roller coaster of emotions, dealing with the "giant wave of disappointment" after being unable to work alongside their mentors and teachers. Still, she said, MN CovidSitters has been "a labor of love" in a time of uncertainty. "So many of us have spent days not showering or eating, just to get this project off the ground so we can serve our community."

Senate passes COVID-19 relief package
.W
The Senate has passed coronavirus relief legislation that includes provisions for free testing for COVID-19 and paid emergency leave.

Update: President Donald Trump has signed the bill into law.The Senate approved on Wednesday a House-passed coronavirus relief package that includes provisions for free testing for COVID-19 and paid emergency leave, clearing the measure for President Donald Trump's signature.Passage of the measure will also allow the Senate to devote its full attention to passing the next relief package in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans had been critical of the House-passed legislation, but emphasized that it is urgent to get relief to the American people amid the coronavirus outbreak.McConnell reiterated today that he will not adjourn the Senate until it passes what lawmakers are describing as a "phase three" economic stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak.After an initial vote last week, the House approved a set of changes to the legislation on Monday, clearing the path for the Senate to take it up this week.The House legislation was negotiated between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration and the president has expressed support for it.To aid in social distancing, McConnell announced ahead of the final vote that senators would take precautions during the vote."What we'll do is have a 30-minute roll call vote. We want to avoid congregating here in the well," he said. "I would encourage our colleagues to come in and vote and depart the chamber so we don't have gaggles of conversation here on the floor. That's particularly important for our staff here and the front of the chamber, so I would encourage everyone to take full advantage of a full 30-minute roll call vote. Come in and vote, and leave."He asked members to be aware of "social distancing" as they came over to the chamber and departed it and said, "With that, I think we will be able to get through the voting that will occur in all likelihood later today without violating any of the safety precautions that have been recommended to us by the Capitol physician and others."Trump's support for the House measure cleared the way for a broad, bipartisan vote in the House at the end of last week. The House later approved a set of changes to the legislation on Monday, clearing the path for the Senate to consider it, which scaled back their efforts to offer millions of Americans paid sick and family leave.The revised legislation would still provide many workers with up to two weeks of paid sick leave if they are being tested or treated for coronavirus or have been diagnosed with it. Also eligible would be those who have been told by a doctor or government official to stay home because of exposure or symptoms.Under the revised bill, however, those payments would be capped at $511 a day, roughly what someone with an $133,000 annual salary earns per day. The original measure called for workers to receive their full pay but limited federal reimbursement to employers to that amount.Workers with family members affected by coronavirus and those whose children's schools have closed would still receive up to two-thirds of their pay, though that benefit would now be limited to $200 a day.

As cities, states and the federal government take increasingly aggressive moves to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the details of a shelter-in-place order and its exceptions for "essential activities" may soon become familiar to millions of Americans.

The basics of a "shelter-in-place" order during the coronavirus outbreak are fairly clear: Stay at home.But as cities, states and the federal government take increasingly aggressive moves to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, the precise details of a shelter-in-place order and its many exceptions for "essential activities" may soon become familiar to millions of Americans across the country.Already, nearly 7 million people living in a wide swath of Northern California are under a shelter-in-place order, which began Monday night.On Tuesday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to prepare for the possibility that there could be a shelter-in-place order within the next two days. Whether that actually happens remains unclear, though. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose approval would be required, has repeatedly downplayed such a move.A growing number of countries have also imposed lockdowns that effectively shut down public life, but the details of such lockdowns vary dramatically. For example, Italy banned all public gatherings and set a 6 p.m. curfew but allowed travel for work or health reasons, while in China, millions of residents are restricted from even going to shop for groceries.What exactly is essential?The shelter-in-place order that San Francisco adopted has fairly large exemptions for health, work, food and even exercise.There, city officials ordered residents to remain in place at their homes except for essential activities, essential business and essential government functions, including:Tasks essential to maintain health and safety, such as obtaining medicine or seeing a doctorGetting necessary services or supplies for themselves or their family or household members, such as getting food and supplies, pet food and other essential supplies necessary for staying at homeEngaging in outdoor activity, such as walking, hiking or running provided that they maintain at least 6 feet of social distancingCaring for a family member in another householdCaring for elderly people, minors, dependents, people with disabilities or other vulnerable persons The shelter-in-place order also does not apply to those going to work in an essential business or essential government function. That includes:Health care operations, including home health workersEssential infrastructure, including construction of housing and operation of public transportation and utilitiesGrocery stores, farmers markets, food banks, convenience storesBusinesses that provide necessities of life for economically disadvantaged individuals and shelter facilitiesPharmacies, health care supply stores and health care facilitiesGas stations and auto repair facilitiesBanksGarbage collectionHardware stores, plumbers, electricians and other service providers necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation and essential operation of residences and other essential businessesEducational institutions, for the purposes of facilitating distance learningLaundromats, dry cleaners and laundry service providersBusinesses that ship or deliver groceries, food and goods directly to residencesChild care facilities providing services that enable essential employees to go to workRoles required for any essential business to "maintain basic operations," which include security, payroll and similar activitiesThe Northern California shelter-in-place order applied to San Francisco and Berkeley as well as residents in San Mateo, Santa Clara, Marin, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, per the order from health officers of those jurisdictions."We must move aggressively and immediately," San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said at a news conference announcing the order.

A former firefighter who came out of retirement after 9/11 attacks among American coronavirus deaths

John Knox was a vibrant 84-year-old who went to the gym until a couple of weeks ago and kept people decades younger on their toes, his son said.

As the coronavirus death toll rises and quarantine forces Americans into lockdowns, details on patients killed by the virus are slowly trickling in.Here's what we know about some of the 145 people who've died since the first U.S. case of the virus was reported in January. Coronavirus has spread to all states, the District of Columbia and some territories.A former firefighter who helped after the Sept. 11 attacksJohn Knox fought fires in New York for nearly four decades.When terrorists hit the twin towers on Sept. 11, years after he'd retired from the Fire Department of New York, he put on his old uniform, grabbed his gear and pickax, and rushed to the World Trade Center to help find firefighters trapped in the rubble.Knox, 84, died this week after suffering complications from coronavirus. In addition to working as a former fire marshal, he also served as a U.S. Marine and took pride in his service to the nation and New York City.So much so, he never returned his fire gear after he retired. He asked the FDNY to bill him for the items, his son said."He took his vehicle and all the gear that he still had remaining from his time at the FDNY .... and made the trek all the way to Ground Zero, and he was down there for several weeks afterward," Zachary Knox told CNN's Anderson Cooper of his father's decision to help after Sept. 11.The elder Knox had pre-existing medical conditions from his work at Ground Zero following the terror attacks, CNN affiliate WCBS reported.Related video: How to do your part and help others during the coronavirus outbreakHis son said he developed symptoms of what appeared to be a light flu, and was hospitalized for about three weeks after he collapsed due to dehydration. His breathing got worse, and he died Monday.His son described him as a vibrant 84-year-old who went to the gym until a couple of weeks ago and kept people decades younger on their toes."He was .... a man full of integrity," his son said. "He lived and died by his word. That's the way he always was .... and everybody, love or hate him, always respected him."It's unclear how Knox got coronavirus. Zachary Knox is mourning his father while in self-quarantine because he visited him while he was hospitalized.A retired magician who loved kidsRichard Curren lived at a Florida assisted living facility with his wife of more than five decades. The retired magician fell ill last week and died days later."Richard was ebullient. He was loving," his wife, Sheila Curren, told CNN affiliate WPLG. "What do you say in a moment like that? He was perfect."Curren was hospitalized with respiratory issues considered fairly routine and died this week, his family said. Doctors notified family members that he died of complications from coronavirus.The 77-year-old Fort Lauderdale resident loved sharing his magic tricks with children."No matter how many joint replacement surgeries he endured, he still couldn't resist a chance to get down on the carpet to play with a toddler," his family told the affiliate.

Coronavirus has spread to all states, the District of Columbia and some territories.                              Advertisement                       A former firefighter who helped after the Sept. 11 attacks John Knox fought fires in New York for nearly four decades. When terrorists hit the twin towers on Sept. 11, years after he'd retired from the Fire Department of New York, he put on his old uniform, grabbed his gear and pickax, and rushed to the World Trade Center to help find firefighters trapped in the rubble. Knox, 84, died this week after suffering complications from coronavirus. In addition to working as a former fire marshal, he also served as a U.S. Marine and took pride in his service to the nation and New York City.                                                                                                                                How the coronavirus is different than the flu                                                                                                                                               Is it allergies, the flu or the coronavirus? How to tell the difference                          So much so, he never returned his fire gear after he retired. He asked the FDNY to bill him for the items, his son said. "He took his vehicle and all the gear that he still had remaining from his time at the FDNY .... and made the trek all the way to Ground Zero, and he was down there for several weeks afterward," Zachary Knox told CNN's Anderson Cooper of his father's decision to help after Sept. 11. The elder Knox had pre-existing medical conditions from his work at Ground Zero following the terror attacks,  CNN affiliate WCBS reported.

His breathing got worse, and he died Monday. His son described him as a vibrant 84-year-old who went to the gym until a couple of weeks ago and kept people decades younger on their toes. "He was .... a man full of integrity," his son said. "He lived and died by his word. That's the way he always was .... and everybody, love or hate him, always respected him." It's unclear how Knox got coronavirus. Zachary Knox is mourning his father while in self-quarantine because he visited him while he was hospitalized.

The retired magician fell ill last week and died days later. "Richard was ebullient. He was loving," his wife, Sheila Curren,  told CNN affiliate WPLG . "What do you say in a moment like that? He was perfect." Curren was hospitalized with respiratory issues considered fairly routine and died this week, his family said. Doctors notified family members that he died of complications from coronavirus. The 77-year-old Fort Lauderdale resident loved sharing his magic tricks with children. "No matter how many joint replacement surgeries he endured, he still couldn't resist a chance to get down on the carpet to play with a toddler," his family told the affiliate.

Joe Coulombe, founder of popular Trader Joe's markets, dead at 89
.W
The man who created Trader Joe's markets with a vision that college-educated but poorly paid young people would buy healthy foods if they could only afford them has died.

Joe Coulombe envisioned a new generation of young grocery shoppers emerging in the 1960s, one that wanted healthy, tasty, high-quality food they couldn't find in most supermarkets and couldn't afford to buy in the few high-end gourmet outlets.So he found a new way to bring everything from a then-exotic snack food called granola to the California-produced wines that for flavor compared with anything from France. And he made shopping for them almost as much fun as sailing the high seas when he created Trader Joe's, a quirky little grocery store filled with nautical themes and staffed not by managers and clerks but by "captains and mates." From the time he opened his first store in Pasadena, California, in 1967 until his death Friday at age 89, Coulombe watched his namesake business rise from a cult favorite of educated but underpaid young people — and a few hippies — to a retail giant with more than 500 outlets in over 40 states.A giant yes, but one that across more than half a century has never lost its reputation for friendly service from employees decked out in goofy Hawaiian shirts, a newsletter that looks like it was published in the 1890s, and rows and rows of high-quality, moderately priced healthy food and great wine, even if you sometimes can't ever again find exactly the same thing. "He wanted to make sure whatever was sold in our store was of good value," said Coulombe's son, also named Joe, who added that his father died following a long illness. "He always did lots of taste tests. My sisters and I remember him bringing home all kinds of things for us to try. At his offices he had practically daily tastings of new products. Always the aim was to provide good food and good value to people."He achieved that by buying directly from wholesalers and cutting out the middleman, in many cases slapping the name Trader Joe's on a bag of nuts, trail mix, organic dried mango, honey-oat cereal or Angus beef chili. He named several products after his daughters Charlotte and Madeleine and gave quirky names to others. Among them were Trader Darwin vitamins and a non-alcoholic sparkling juice called Eve's Apple Sparkled by Adam.He prided himself on checking out every vintage of wine from California's Napa Valley, including Trader Joe's standby, Charles Shaw, affectionately known as Two-Buck Chuck because it sold for $1.99. (It still does in the California stores, although shipping costs have increased the price in other states.)"He sold a lot of better wines too," his son noted with a laugh, recalling trips the family made to France to seek them out. After selling Trader Joe's to German grocery retailer Aldi in 1979, Coulombe remained as its CEO until 1988, when he left to launch a second career as what he called a "temp," coming in as interim CEO or consultant for several large companies in transition. He retired in 2013. Joseph Hardin Coulombe, an only child, was born on June 3, 1930, in San Diego and lived on an avocado ranch in nearby Del Mar. After serving in the Air Force, he attended Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics, a master's in business administration and met and married his wife, Alice.A few years after graduation, he was hired by the Rexall drugstore chain, which tasked him with establishing a chain of convenience stores called Pronto. When Rexall lost interest in the stores, he bought them and had grown the chain to about a dozen outlets when the huge 7-Eleven company made a major push into Southern California. "So I had to do something different," he told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. "Scientific American had a story that of all people qualified to go to college, 60% were going. I felt this newly educated — not smarter but better-educated — class of people would want something different, and that was the genesis of Trader Joe's."His wife's parents had introduced him to a world of foods previously unfamiliar to him, including fine olive oil, fresh seafood and inexpensive quality wine, and he figured things like that would be perfect for the younger audience he was seeking. As he bargained for those products, he'd sometimes come across a particularly exceptional olive oil or vintage wine, never to find it again, and he wouldn't stock an inferior product in its place.He eschewed promotional gimmicks like loyalty clubs or loss-leader sales, getting the word out with brief radio spots and the Trader Joe's "Fearless Flyer" newsletter, whose old-style appearance was inspired by another money-saving effort. He wanted to dress up the newsletter's stories with illustrations he cut out of magazines, but he made sure he only took ones on which the copyrights had expired. He passed such savings on not only to his customers but employees, which Trader Joe's boasts are among retail's best compensated, with medical, dental, vision and retirement plans and annual salary increases the company says range from 7% to 10%. Many workers have remained with Trader Joe's for decades. "He just had a visit yesterday from employee No. 1," his daughter Charlotte said shortly before her father's death. He and his wife also became well known in Southern California philanthropic circles, contributing time and money to such causes as Planned Parenthood, the Los Angeles Opera and the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens.Stories differ on how the name Trader Joe's came about, with some saying it was inspired by a ride on Disneyland's Jungle Cruise boat or a book he read called "White Shadows in the South Seas" or his favorite college hangout being a Trader Vic's bar near Stanford.Coulombe, who loved to travel, did acknowledge over the years that he had a fascination with the South Seas and put Trader into the name and a nautical theme inside the stores to lend that exotic appeal to customers. In addition to his three children and wife of 67 years, Coulombe is survived by six grandchildren.

After CDC confirms the first US coronavirus case of 'unknown' origin, it sends out new testing guidelines
.W
A patient in California who has coronavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus.

After a U.S. patient contracted novel coronavirus and left medical authorities no clues as to where it came from, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers, the top CDC official said Thursday.A patient in California who has coronavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the CDC announced Wednesday night. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.The patient is in serious condition, Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district in California where the patient is from, told CNN."Whether this person can actually talk or not is of question. She's been intubated, and so may not be in a position to discuss it," he said.Earlier in the outbreak, CDC guidance to doctors in the United States was that a patient had to have a travel history to China or be a close contact of someone who had been there before being tested, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.The new patient who prompted the guidance change was transferred from another Northern California hospital last week.According to a letter from UC Davis Health, because the patient "did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered." After doctors persisted in their request for the test, on Sunday, the CDC went ahead with testing.That patient became the first U.S. case of unknown origin, according to the CDC. It could be the first U.S. case of "community spread" of the virus, when the source of the infection is unknown."As soon as that case was recognized, we met and we revised our case definition for persons under investigation," Redfield said. "Today, that has been posted (to the CDC website) along with a new health advisory that the recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus."The mysterious nature of this case is significant, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, an infectious disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center."That suggests that the virus is out there in the community, and that means pretty much that everybody's at risk," he told KCRA. "We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we can get it from."As for whoever passed the virus to the UC Davis patient, "that other person probably exposed other people," Blumberg said."And you have to realize that this virus is so new, that none of us have any immunity to it. So, anybody who's exposed is at high risk of getting infected with this."Health officials are now trying to trace those who may have been in contact with the UC Davis patient."We currently have people in the field working in the community from the local, from the state and also from the CDC," said Dr. Sonia Angell, Director of the California Department of Public Health."They're contacting any individuals who might have been exposed, and they're isolating them."But Angell emphasized "the risk to the general public remains low."The United States has 60 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.42 are former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent outbreak and quarantine.3 are Americans recently repatriated from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak.1 patient at UC Davis Medical Center contracted the illness through unknown means.Most of the other 14 patients either had recently been to China or are a spouse of someone who recently returned from China.On Friday, the World Health Organization upgraded the potential of the virus spreading from "high" to "very high."Despite the upgrade, WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stopped short of declaring the virus a pandemic. "We do not see evidence yet that the virus is spreading freely in communities," he said.'Simply inadequate' number of test kits so farThere's been a strain on testing capabilities since novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States last month.In the early weeks of the virus, the CDC was the only facility in the United States that could test for the virus.Since then, coronavirus test kits have been shipped to labs across the country, but some produced inconclusive results. The CDC said it would remake parts of the test kits.The UC Davis patient was transferred from another California hospital Feb. 19 with a suspected viral infection, the university hospital's letter said.UC Davis said it requested CDC testing for Covid-19, the formal name of the virus, because neither Sacramento County nor the California Department of Public Health were conducting testing."Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered," the letter says. "UC Davis Health does not control the testing process."The patient is from Solano County, which declared a local emergency Thursday, allowing it to use funds for response efforts.Multiple health care personnel were exposed to the patient, Solano County Health and Social Services public health officer Dr. Bela Matyas said.Since the patient didn't meet the criteria for testing, the patient was not in airborne isolation initially, Matyas said.Hospitals are trying to identify the people who were exposed to the patient to put them into appropriate categories -- whether they need to be under isolation or under quarantine, he added.Some of the patient's family members are in isolation, he said. The person has no connection to Travis Air Force Base, which is in the county and has seen several repatriation flights from China.California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at least 8,400 people have been monitored locally, but the number of test kits his state has received isn't enough."We have just 200 kits, and that's for not just the traditional diagnostic, but also surveillance. It's simply inadequate," Newsom said Thursday. "But no longer will that be the case. ... We have been assured of our capacity to significantly, exponentially increase the capacity to test."By this weekend, 93 labs across the United States are expected to have testing capabilities, Azar said. And as many as 70 companies are vying to develop a "bedside diagnostic" test for hospital use.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized a two-step test that will allow labs other than the CDC to test for the virus, Azar said.Previously, the process for testing involved three steps. The third step had been causing some inconclusive results, Azar said.As of Wednesday afternoon, "the FDA authorized the use of those tests by using just the first and second step (to) provide a definitive diagnostic," Azar said. "Forty labs are qualified to already be doing that."U.S. is testing treatmentMeanwhile, a clinical trial is underway at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha to evaluate how effective an antiviral drug would be on people diagnosed with coronavirus, the National Institutes of Health said.There have been at least 82,056 confirmed cases worldwide and at least 2,800 deaths -- the vast majority in China. The drug being tested in the trial, remdesivir, was previously tested in humans for Ebola, but studies found it was ineffective in fighting that disease. It was also tested in MERS and SARS trials in animals.There are also clinical trials of the drug going on in China, the NIH said, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases developed the American study to match those studies.The first participant in the Omaha trial is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.Participants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.

There are also clinical trials of the drug going on in China, the NIH said, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases developed the American study to match those studies. The first participant in the Omaha trial is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Participants will receive 200 milligrams of remdesivir intravenously when they're enrolled and another 100 while they're hospitalized for up to 10 days in total. A placebo group will receive a solution that resembles remdesivir but contains only inactive ingredients, the NIH said.

North Korea fires presumed short-range missiles into the sea
.W
South Korean officials expressed strong concern over the resumption of testing activity, which could raise military tensions.

North Korea fired two presumed short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern sea on Monday, South Korean officials said, resuming weapons demonstrations after a months-long hiatus that may have been forced by the coronavirus crisis in Asia.The launches came two days after North Korea’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un supervised an artillery drill aimed at testing the combat readiness of units in front-line and eastern areas.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the projectiles were fired from an area near the coastal town of Wonsan and flew about 149 miles northeast on an apogee of about 22 miles. It said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were jointly analyzing the launches. JCS officials later told reporters the weapons were presumed to be short-range ballistic missiles.North Korea likely tested one of its new road-mobile, solid-fuel missile systems or a developmental “super large” multiple rocket launcher it repeatedly demonstrated last year, said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies. Experts say such weapons can potentially overwhelm missile defense systems and expand the North’s ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. bases there.Kim Jong Un had entered the new year vowing to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of “gangster-like” U.S. sanctions and pressure, using a key ruling party meeting in late December to warn of “shocking” action over stalled nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.He also said North Korea would soon reveal a new “strategic weapon” and insisted the country was no longer “unilaterally bound” to a self-imposed suspension on the testing of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missiles. But Kim did not explicitly lift the moratorium or give any clear indication that such tests were impending and seemed to leave the door open for eventual negotiations.South Korea's presidential office said National Security Director Chung Eui-yong discussed the launches with the South's defense minister and spy chief, and that the officials expressed “strong concern” over the North's resumption of testing activity, which could raise military tensions.Japan said that it had not detected any projectile landing in its territory or its exclusive economic zone, and that no sea vessels or aircraft had been damaged.“The repeated firings of ballistic missiles by North Korea is a serious problem for the international community including Japan, and the government will continue to gather and analyze information, and monitor the situation to protect the lives and property of the people," the Defense Ministry's statement said.The recent lull in North Korea's launches had experts wondering whether the North was holding back its weapons displays while it was fighting the coronavirus, which state media has described as a matter of “national existence.” Some analysts speculated that the North cut back training and other activities involving large gatherings of soldiers to reduce the possibility of the virus spreading within its military.Kim’s latest show of force is apparently aimed at boosting military morale, strengthening internal unity and showing that his country is doing fine despite outside worries of how the North would contend with an outbreak.North Korea in previous years has intensified testing activity in response to springtime military exercises between South Korea and the United States that it has described as invasion rehearsals. But the allies announced last week that they were postponing their annual drills due to concern about the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea, with soldiers from both countries being infected.The launches were the latest setback for dovish South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who despite the North’s indifference has repeatedly pleaded for reviving inter-Korean engagement. In a speech on Sunday marking the 101st anniversary of a major uprising against Japanese colonial rule, Moon called for cooperation between the two Koreas to fight infectious diseases amid the COVID-19 outbreak in Asia.Amid the deadlock in larger nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration, Kim has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in the past months while demanding that Seoul defy U.S.-led international sanctions and restart inter-Korean economic projects that would jolt the North’s broken economy.North Korea has yet to confirm any COVID-19 cases, although state media have hinted that an uncertain number of people have been quarantined after exhibiting symptoms. North Korea has shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned tourists, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized tens of thousands of health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms. South Korea last month withdrew dozens of officials from an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong after North Korea insisted on closing it until the epidemic is controlled.Kim and President Donald Trump have met three times since embarking on their high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018, but negotiations have faltered since their second summit in February last year in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability.Following the collapse in Hanoi, the North ended a 17-month pause in ballistic activity and conducted at least 13 rounds of weapons launches last year, using the standstill in talks to expand its military capabilities.Those weapons included road-mobile, solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile defense systems and a developmental midrange missile that could eventually be launched from submarines, potentially strengthening the North’s ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. bases there.In December, the North said it conducted two “crucial” tests at a long-range rocket facility that would strengthen its nuclear deterrent, prompting speculation that it’s developing a new ICBM or preparing a satellite launch that would further advance its long-range missile technology.

Coronavirus cases in China top 20,000 as Hong Kong closes most borders
.W
The mainland's latest figures of 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed infections with the new coronavirus were up from 361 deaths and 17,205 cases the previous day.

China said Tuesday the number of infections from a new virus surpassed 20,000 as medical workers and patients arrived at a new hospital and President Xi Jinping said, “We have launched a people's war of prevention of the epidemic.”Xi presided over a special meeting of the top Communist Party body for the second time since the crisis started, telling the Politburo standing committee on Monday the country must race against time to curb the spread of the virus. He also said those who neglect their duties will be punished, state broadcaster CCTV reported.Hong Kong shut almost all of its land and sea border crossings with the mainland at midnight after medical workers began a strike demanding the border be closed completely. More than 2,000 hospital workers went on strike Monday, and their union has threatened a bigger walkout Tuesday.Hong Kong was hit hard by SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-03, an illness from the same family of viruses as the current outbreak, which many believe was intensified by official Chinese secrecy and obfuscation.The mainland's latest figures of 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed infections with the new coronavirus were up from 361 deaths and 17,205 cases the previous day. Outside mainland China, at least 180 cases have been confirmed, including one fatality, in the Philippines.Other countries are continuing evacuations and restricting the entry of Chinese or people who have recently traveled in the country. A plane carrying Malaysians from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, where the illness has been concentrated, arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday morning, and the 133 people on board were to be screened and quarantined for 14 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus.Medical teams from the People's Liberation Army were arriving in Wuhan to relieve overwhelmed health workers and to staff the new 1,000-bed hospital. It was built in just 10 days, its prefabricated wards equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and ventilation systems.A 1,500-bed hospital also specially built for patients infected with the new virus is due to open within days.With no end to the outbreak in sight, authorities in Hubei and elsewhere extended the Lunar New Year holiday break, due to end this week, well into February to try to keep people at home and reduce the spread of the virus. All Hubei schools are postponing the start of the new semester until further notice.Chinese scientists said they have more evidence the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan in December, likely originated in bats. In a study published in the journal Nature, Shi Zhen-Li and colleagues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported that genome sequences from seven patients were 96% identical to a bat coronavirus.SARS is also believed to have originated in bats, although it jumped to civet cats before infecting people. Scientists suspect the latest outbreak began at a seafood market in Wuhan where wild animals were on sale and in contact with people.Japanese officials were considering a quarantine of more than 3,000 people on a cruise ship that carried a passenger who tested positive for the virus. The passenger on the Japanese-operated Diamond Princess left the vessel while it was in Hong Kong on Jan. 25.The ship returned to Yokohama after making port calls in Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa. A team of quarantine officials and medical staff boarded the ship Monday and began medical checks of everyone on board, a health ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with department rules.The ship's captain said Hong Kong's health authorities notified the ship about the passenger's infection on Saturday, according to a recording of the announcement tweeted by a passenger. The patient is recovering, and his traveling companions so far have not been infected, the captain's announcement said.“I wish we were informed as soon as they found out, then I could have worn a mask or washed hands more carefully," the passenger said. “I was in Hong Kong nine days ago and it seems to be too late now.”             BEIJING, China

Airport officials scramble to meet the demands of new coronavirus travel rules
.W
Planes carrying U.S. citizens who have recently been in China must land at one of 11 designated airports.

As the worldwide death toll from Wuhan coronavirus approaches 500 people, airport and local officials in the United States are on the front lines in trying to stop the virus's spread.The problem: Some say they've barely received any guidance or logistical help in implementing new travel and quarantine rules ordered by the federal government."Everyone has been trying to nail down clarifications on the travel ban," an official at a major West Coast airport told CNN."There were questions along the line like, 'How is this going to work? What are going to be the procedures?' and 'What are the details on a quarantine?'"The new federal rules, which went into effect Sunday, include:-- Temporarily banning any foreign national who has visited China in the past 14 days from entering the U.S.-- Forcing U.S. citizens who have recently traveled to Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- to be quarantined for up to 14 days after their return to the U.S.-- Requiring U.S. citizens returning from other parts of mainland China to undergo health screenings at selected ports of entry. These Americans could also undergo up to 14 days of self-monitored quarantine.A government official on the East Coast told CNN after the Trump administration's coronavirus travel restrictions came down, local and state officials were left scrambling to figure out how and where to quarantine people who were asymptomatic, but may have been exposed to the virus.The official said that planes were arriving "within hours" with no federal protocols in place, other than that people with symptoms would be treated locally by state and local health agencies, while quarantine locations were still to be determined."The federal government basically said, we're going to bring these planes in, and when they land, you guys figure it out," the government official said.Planes carrying U.S. citizens who have recently been in China must land at one of 11 designated airports: John F.

Ghebreyesus said in a Tuesday briefing to the UN's executive board in Geneva."Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves."At the world's busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, no passengers have shown symptoms of coronavirus or have needed to be quarantined, spokeswoman Alnissa Ruiz-Craig said.Newark Liberty International Airport also hasn't quarantined anyone over concerns about coronavirus, the New Jersey Department of Health said.

Kentucky gas station drops price to 99 cents per gallon, GasBuddy reports

Gas pump prices are dropping across the country amid the COVID-19 outbreak that has caused oil prices to drop and gas prices to follow suit, according to reports from GasBuddy and AAA.

Gas pump prices are dropping across the country amid the COVID-19 outbreak that has caused oil prices to drop and gas prices to follow suit, according to reports from GasBuddy and AAA.AAA said that as crude oil prices trend lower, people across the country are seeing gas prices plummet. Gas prices in 35 states saw a double-digit decrease, setting the national average to $2.25, the cheapest price point of the year. “These are significant decreases in just seven and 16 days,” said Jeanette Casselano, AAA spokesperson. “AAA expects gas prices to continue trending cheaper, with the high likelihood of the national average hitting $2/gallon before the end of March.”AAA said that amid the COVID-19 outbreak, gas prices are declining despite increasing gasoline demand and decreasing U.S. stock levels.According to the AAA report, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana were included in the top 10 largest weekly decreases. Kentucky and Indiana were also included in the top 10 least expensive markets. Officials with GasBuddy said a month ago their petroleum analyst noticed the first signs of gas prices dropping, and now people across the country have noticed prices remarkably low.GasBuddy said since the demand for oil has dropped, though the supply remains high, that has caused gas prices to drop. GasBuddy confirmed the first U.S. gas station that has lowered its price to 99 cents per gallon is at a BP station in London, Kentucky.  COVID-19 has caused countries to be in lockdown, limiting driving, flying and overall movement in order to contain the spread. This means very little need or demand for oil, GasBuddy said.

President Trump says FDA will fast track anti-viral treatments for patients with coronavirus
.W
President Donald Trump says he's pushed the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate barriers to getting therapeutics for coronavirus to patients.

President Donald Trump says he's pushed the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate barriers to getting therapeutics for coronavirus to patients.He said hydroxychloroquine — ⁠ a drug currently used to fight malaria ⁠— would be made available almost immediately to treat coronavirus."It's been around for a long time so we know if things don't go as planned it's not going to kill anybody," Trump told reporters at the White House."We have to remove every barrier or a lot of barriers that were unnecessary and they've done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments and we think we have some good answers," Trump said.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn carefully tempered the president's remarks regarding his team's work to develop treatments for coronavirus."The FDA is committed to continuing to provide regulatory flexibility and guidance, but let me make one thing clear: the FDA's responsibility to the American people is to ensure that products are safe and effective," he said.He said the FDA is expanding its work regarding potential therapeutic options."We need to make sure that this sea of new treatments -- we'll get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time," he said, explaining that the right drug may be available but it may not be in the right dosage, "and that may do more harm than good."Part of that, Hahn said, is exploring drugs that are "already approved for other indications," noting the president's remarks on chloroquine."That's a drug that the president has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done and to actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial, a large, pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information," he said.He also explained the process of convalescent plasma, which has to do with isolating blood from those who have survived the coronavirus and have the right immunoglobulins. A concentration of that could treat people infected with the virus.As for a timeline, Hahn said, "over the next couple of weeks, we'll have more information that we're really pushing hard to try to accelerate... and that will be a bridge to other therapies that will take us three to six months to develop. And this is a continuous process -- there is no beginning and end."He also said there is a vaccine trial currently being performed that is expected to take "12 months."Early evidence from human cells suggests that chloroquine⁠ — which is used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases ⁠— may have some activity against the novel coronavirus. Doctors in China, the U.S. and other countries have used the drug experimentally in COVID-19 patients, but there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it's effective in humans.The drug, generally considered to be safe for most patients, can have side effects including seizures, nausea, vomiting, deafness, vision changes and low blood pressure.When asked about chloroquine last month, Dr. Janet Diaz of the World Health Organization said "there is no proof that that is an effective treatment at this time. We recommend that therapeutics be tested under ethically approved clinical trials to show efficacy and safety."At the time, she said the drugs that were being prioritized by WHO's research and development efforts were antivirals, a separate type of drug that includes remdesivir, which is also the focus of clinical trials in China and the U.S.                        President Donald Trump says he's pushed the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate barriers to getting therapeutics for coronavirus to patients.

Family of 4 could get $3,000 under coronavirus relief plan, Treasury secretary says
.W
The first federal checks to Americans could be $3,000 for a family of four under the White House proposal to unleash $1 trillion for the coronavirus outbreak.

The first federal checks to Americans could be $3,000 for a family of four under the White House proposal to unleash $1 trillion to shore up households and the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus outbreak.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the “checks in the mail” would be direct deposited into people’s accounts under the plan the Trump administration has proposed to Congress.The payments would be $1,000 per adult and $500 per child so that a family of two parents and two children would receive $3,000, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network. The goal is to get that money out in three weeks, he said.“That’s a lot of money for hard-working Americans,” Mnuchin said.He said such families would receive another $3,000 six weeks later if the national emergency still exists. Officials have previously said the money is expected to be allocated by income level, to exclude the super-wealthy.Congress is rushing to compile the sweeping economic rescue package, the biggest undertaking since the 2008 recession and financial crisis, in a matter of days.Details on Trump's economic rescue plan are still being worked out — and it's sure to grow beyond $1 trillion, lawmakers said — but its centerpiece is to dedicate $500 billion to start issuing direct payments to Americans, starting early next month.The Treasury Department proposed two $250 billion cash infusions to individuals: a first set of checks issued starting April 6, with a second wave in mid-May.The emerging package would also funnel cash to businesses to help keep workers on payroll as widespread sectors of the $21 trillion U.S. economy all but shut down.It also is expected to include sweeping health provisions. President Donald Trump has invoked wartime authority to ramp up output of vital medical supplies and erect temporary field hospitals under the Defense Production Act.“There is not a day to lose," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Thursday. "We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.”Taken together, the administration plan promises half of the $1 trillion to families and individuals, with the other half used to prop up businesses and keep employees on payroll.Direct payments would go to U.S. citizens only, and would be “tiered based on income level and family size.” The two payments would be identical, with the second wave starting by May 18.Trump has already signed into law a $100 billion-plus bill to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers hit by it.The Senate plans to remain in session until the third coronavirus bill passes, with weekend sessions possible. The pressure is enormous on lawmakers to act fast and not allow gamesmanship to get in the way of results.Economists say the country is probably already in recession. The panic has many lawmakers shedding their ideological baggage to grapple with an enormous undertaking for a crisis that exceeds the scope of the 2008 financial panic — a virtual weekslong shutdown of many businesses and unemployment that could spike to 20% by some estimates.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to take control of the third coronavirus effort, putting GOP chairmen in charge and promising to consult with Senate Democrats later. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York blasted McConnell's approach, saying it's “too cumbersome, too partisan and will take far too long, given the urgency and need for cooperation.”Schumer's office says he has spoken several times already with Mnuchin, however, and retains considerable influence as the Senate plans to work into the weekend to try to pass the measure. Pelosi and McConnell have talked as wellPelosi said late Wednesday that her priorities for the bill include expanding eligibility for unemployment insurance and aid to small businesses that ensures workers will be paid. Democrats are also sure to seek aid to states whose budgets are falling out of balance.Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chairman of a GOP task force responsible for a $50 billion airline rescue package, says there won’t be a cash bailout like after the 9/11 attacks, but that Republicans are reviving an emergency loan program from that time to provide airlines federally guaranteed loans on favorable terms. The airlines are under criticism from Democrats for using cash stockpiled from large recent profits and lower corporate tax rates to buy back stock in order to inflate their share price. Economists doubted that the massive economic rescue package being drafted would enough to stop millions of jobs losses, even if in the short term. It's aimed at helping Americans without paychecks avoid foreclosure and other financial hardships and preventing businesses from sliding into bankruptcy.In the House, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, released statements saying they had tested positive for COVID-19 — the first two known cases in Congress. Several other lawmakers have cycled in and out of self-isolation after exposure to individuals who had later tested positive for the virus.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.             WASHINGTON

Tens of thousands of additional workers sought for hire amid coronavirus backlash

The need comes after Amazon led an announcement earlier this week that it will hire 100,000 people to fulfill orders.

Business shutdowns and other drastic changes have taken away livelihoods, but whiplash is creating job opportunities.The call for hires comes amid spikes in unemployment claims due to the COVID-19 outbreak.But multiple businesses, including Domino's Pizza and grocery chain Kroger, are seeking to hire around 10,000 workers each. Earlier this week, Amazon led an announcement that it will hire 100,000 people to fulfill orders.  Domino’s Pizza says it is hiring approximately 10,000 workers in the U.S. to meet rising demand for delivery and carryout. Domino’s said it needs delivery drivers, pizza makers, managers and truck drivers for its U.S. stores, which remain open for carryout and also offer contact-less delivery.Officials with the Cincinnati-based grocery chain Kroger announced Wednesday it is hiring 10,000 new associates nationwide combined across all its retail stores, manufacturing plants and distribution center.Kroger is decreasing the standard hiring period to expedite its process. That means hires can begin work in just a few days.Kroger is experiencing an unprecedented wave of shoppers amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. Store officials said that many stores have closed their services departments, including meat and deli counters. Spokesperson Erin Rolfes  said that's not because of any concerns about illness. It's simply because stores need those workers to help restock shelves and help keep everything clean.Meanwhile, the parent company of a supermarket chain operating 132 stores throughout the northeast said it is planning to hire thousands of people to help its business keep up with the demand driven by the coronavirus pandemic.Based in Schenectady, New York, the Golub Corp. owns Price Chopper and Market 32 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania. The company said it hopes to add more than 2,000 new employees to its existing staff of about 20,000.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Fact Check: Viral posts falsely align viruses to election years
.W
Viral posts on social media are falsely claiming COVID-19 is no worse than other outbreaks that have occurred in “every election year."

Posted on March 18, 2020We are collaborating with FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.A viral image of a whiteboard sign claiming to have been “Posted at a Doctors office today” purportedly lists disease outbreaks that occurred in “every election year” since 2004. The image says the new coronavirus is “being hyped as The Black Plague.” One Facebook post that shared the photo includes a comment that the new coronavirus “is hyped to make Trump look bad.”But the dates listed for the outbreaks of most of the diseases are incorrect; the impact of those diseases was not widely felt in federal election years.The image, which appears in numerous Facebook posts, shows a handwritten sign that reads, in part, “Every election year has a disease.” It then lists: “SARS-2004 Avian-2008 Swine-2010 MERS-2012 Ebola-2014 Zika-2016 Ebola-2018 Corona-2020”The list focuses on presidential election and midterm election years. It leaves out the 2006 midterm election year.We looked at the websites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find when the diseases began and when they became widespread.The first disease listed on the posts is SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and it is listed beside the year 2004. In reality, the first diagnosed cases of SARS occurred in November 2002 in China, according to the CDC. By May 2003, the disease had been contained in the United States, so it was no longer spreading. The 2004 presidential election was in November, a year and a half later.“Avian,” short for the avian flu, or H5N1, is listed on the posts alongside the year 2008, but that influenza was first detected in humans in 1997, according to the CDC. It reemerged in 2003, but the first infection in North America wasn’t until January 2014 in Canada. The CDC reports “to date, there have not been any reports of HPAI Asian H5N1 virus infections in people in the United States and Asian H5N1 has never been detected in U.S. birds or poultry.” No part of the avian flu timeline aligns meaningfully with the November 2008 presidential election.The posts list “Swine-2010,” short for swine flu, or 2009 H1N1. The CDC’s timeline of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic notes that the disease emerged in California in April 2009. By December 2009, a vaccine was widely available, and by January 2010, “activity declined to levels below baseline, but persisted for several more months at lower levels.” The WHO announced the end of the pandemic in August 2010. The 2010 midterm election was three months later in November.MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, which is the year listed in the posts. But according to the CDC, only two patients have ever tested positive in the United States, and that didn’t happen until 2014, long after the 2012 presidential election.The viral image listing Ebola as occurring in 2014 makes sense. The West Africa Ebola outbreak began in December 2013 and had spread to the capitals of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by July 2014.However, only 11 people were ever treated for Ebola in the U.S. Only two of them — nurses who were treating a man who had the disease and had just arrived in Texas from West Africa — contracted the disease in the U.S.Zika is another disease that has been around for many years, much like the avian flu. According to the WHO, it was first identified in Uganda in 1947. In the posts, Zika is listed alongside the year 2016, which more or less coincides with the most recent global outbreak. The disease became widespread in Central and South America in late 2015 to early 2016, and the WHO declared a public health emergency in February 2016. The disease continued to spread in 2016, including to the U.S.It’s unclear why Ebola is listed again beside the year 2018. It’s true that outbreaks of the disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued in 2017 and 2018, but fewer than 100 people were infected, which pales in comparison to the 28,610 people infected in the 2014 West African epidemic.The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019. The CDC announced the first U.S. case in Washington state on Jan. 21. As of March 18, there were more than 7,000 cases reported in the U.S. and more than 100 deaths.Michael Levy, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that epidemics are becoming more frequent. “As we become more numerous on the planet, there are more opportunities for pathogens to emerge,” he said in a phone interview.The posts also claim the novel coronavirus “has a contagion factor of 2.” This refers to the number of people to which an infected person can transmit the disease, also known as the R0 number. The WHO estimates this number to be 1.4 to 2.5 for COVID-19, but estimates vary because the disease is so new.The posts use upper-range estimates for the contagion factor of the other diseases. It says that SARS has an R0 of 4. According to the WHO, SARS has an R0 in the range of 2 to 4. The posts also claim that the R0 for measles is 18. Measles is most often cited as having an R0 range of 12 to 18, and studies have found that estimates could vary more widely.The posts also claim that the “cure rate” for people under 50 infected with COVID-19 is 99.7%, which would equate to a death rate of 0.3%. But the data to confirm or debunk this statistic doesn’t exist yet.As we previously reported, we know the number of reported cases and how many people have died. But there are unreported cases, so we don’t know how many people have the disease. For instance, there are people who have mild cases and don’t seek treatment or don’t even know they have it. But, as Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed to Congress, even an estimated 1% fatality rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, whose mortality rate is about 0.1%. And  there may be unreported deaths mistakenly attributed to other causes.Finally, the posts claim that the spread of COVID-19 is leveling off. This is false. According to the WHO, new cases had leveled off in China in late February, but according to the CDC, “states  where community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase.”COVID-19 is “definitely not leveling off in the U.S.,” Levy said. He noted that China has seen new cases of the disease level off largely because “drastic measures were taken.”                        Posted on March 18, 2020                                                                                                           Advertisement                       We are collaborating with  FactCheck.org , a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, in an effort to identify misinformation and to ensure news consumers get the facts.

.W
The GOP leader was poised to unveil the sweeping response Thursday as Congress raced to draft a $1 trillion measure to shore up for households and the U.S. economy.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed direct payments of $1,200 per person and $2,400 for couples as part of a sweeping Republican response to the coronavirus  outbreak, according to a copy of the legislation obtained by The Associated Press.The GOP leader unveiled his plan Thursday as Congress raced to craft a $1 trillion rescue package to shore up households, healthcare and the U.S. economy amid the pandemic crisis and nationwide shutdown that's hurtling the country toward a likely recession. “We need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,” McConnell said while announcing his plan on the Senate floor.It's an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Donald Trump urges Congress to “go big” to respond as Americans reel from the crisis.Keeping paychecks flowing for idled workers as jobless claims skyrocket  is a top priority for both the Republican and Democratic plans emerging from Congress.McConnell's proposal aligns with the Trump administration's push to swiftly send checks to American households.Under the GOP leader's plan, the aid would be phased down at income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child.But Democrats have their own proposals for ushering aid to Americans, and even McConnell's GOP senators panned Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's idea of direct checks of $3,000 for a family of four — preferring instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls.“What I want is income, not one check,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks “makes no sense to me,” he said.“It's not a check. It's checks. It's not a payment, it's income,” Graham said. “The best thing for us to do is create an income stream." The swift-moving effort in an all-but-shuttered Capitol came as the first two lawmakers tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, others are self-isolating and the usually tradition-bound Congress faced calls to ease rules and allow remote voting. Trump administration officials, including Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow, are expected to return to Capitol Hill on Friday to launch bipartisan negotiations with Senate Democrats.Vast government spending of untold sums is causing unease among GOP senators whose careers have been built on halting the flow of federal dollars and trying to halt rising debts. But other Republicans said they had no choice but to provide a lifeline to Americans and small businesses."The government is causing this economic crisis by shutting down the country and so we’re going to have to pay what it costs,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Health Committee.The Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people’s accounts under the plan the Trump administration has proposed to Congress.The payments would be $1,000 per adult and $500 per child so that a family of two parents and two children would receive $3,000, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network. The goal is to get that money out in three weeks, he said.“That’s a lot of money for hard-working Americans,” Mnuchin said. Republicans want to have small businesses send paychecks to workers being forced to stay home —through government loans that would not have to be repaid — to prevent employees being cast aside. They also want to shore up industry. McConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines, $8 billion for air cargo carriers and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back.Democrats compiling their own priorities in the House and Senate suggested other ways to keep paychecks flowing in what Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called “employment insurance” — which he characterized as “unemployment insurance on steroids.”At the same time, caring for the expected surge of sick Americans is a priority. Congress wants to ramp up production of medical supplies and rapidly erect temporary field hospitals under new authorities Trump invoked in the Defense Production Act.“America needs a Marshall Plan for our health care system,” said Schumer, citing the post-World War II program in which the U.S. financed rebuilding in Europe.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Trump to quickly use his new wartime authority to push manufacturers to start producing the medical supplies.“There is not a day to lose," Pelosi said in a statement. "We must put more testing, more protective equipment and more ventilators into the hands of our frontline workers immediately.”The centerpiece of the White House effort is $500 billion to start issuing direct payments to Americans, starting early next month. How to spend that money, though, remains a key question.The Treasury Department proposed two $250 billion cash infusions to individuals: a first set of checks issued starting April 6, with a second wave by mid-May. Officials have previously said the money is expected to be allocated by income level to exclude the super-wealthy. Direct payments would go to U.S. citizens only and would be “tiered based on income level and family size.” The two payments would be identical, with the second wave starting by May 18.Meanwhile, industries of all kinds are lining up for help to avoid cratering the economy and devastating the home lives of their employees. Groups representing hospitals, doctors and nurses are asking Congress for $100 billion to help the health care system respond to the challenge of COVID-19, which could involve providing treatment for tens of thousands of seriously ill people.The total price tag is sure to grow beyond $1 trillion, lawmakers said.Taken together, the administration plan promises half of the $1 trillion to families and individuals, with the other half used to prop up businesses and keep employees on payroll.Trump has already signed into law a $100 billion-plus bill to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers hit by it. Earlier, Congress passed and Trump signed an initial $8.3 billion effort.As Congress rushes to compile the sweeping economic rescue package, the biggest undertaking since the 2008 recession and financial crisis, in a matter of days, it also is considering its own way of doing business. The Senate plans to remain in session until the emerging coronavirus bill passes, with weekend sessions possible. The House, which is on recess, won't be recalled until it's time to vote.In the House, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, released statements saying they had tested positive for COVID-19 — the first two known cases in Congress. Several other lawmakers have cycled in and out of self-isolation after exposure to individuals who had later tested positive for the virus.On Thursday, McAdams told NBC's “Today” show the House should consider changing its rules to allow remote voting. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he shares lawmakers' concerns about the potential risks of congregating in groups and is considering ways to “adjust our voting procedures” to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations on social distancing.Economists say the country is probably already in recession and the massive rescue package now being drafted would probably not be enough to stop millions of job losses. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Stores setting limits on sanitizing, cold and flu products amid demand from coronavirus fears

Kroger is limiting the amount of sanitization and cold and flu products you can buy, and it's not the only store.

Kroger is joining stores like Home Depot, Amazon and eBay are limiting the amount of, face masks, sanitization and cold and flu products you can buy.The new action comes amid a rash of demand for the products triggered by the spread of coronavirus across the United States.Long lines at stores and panic buying on cleaning products throughout the country are stretching American retailers' ability to keep up with demand. Shoppers are posting pictures on social media of lines snaking around Costco and empty shelves of sanitizers at CVS, Walgreens and other drug stores.Demand for products like hand sanitizers, face masks and cleaning wipes has spiked, according to CVS, Walgreens and others. CVS warned it may cause supply shortages.Kroger posted a notice to its website Monday, saying, "Due to high demand and to support all customers, we will be limiting the number of Sanitization, and Cold and Flu related product to 5 each per order. Your order may be modified at time of pickup or delivery."Additional details were not provided.The new limitations seem to only apply to online sales. It is unclear if the limitations apply to in-store purchases. WLWT has reached out to Kroger for comment. Kroger is one of the nation's first retailers to limit supplies. Many across the country appear to be reacting to news of the spread of COVID-19 by stocking up on face masks, hand sanitizers and non-perishable items.Cases of the virus in the U.S. have now risen to more than 100. It has been reported in 12 states, with the majority of cases being reported in California and Washington, where six people have died.About of quarter of those cases were likely transmitted through U.S. communities, officials said, meaning they were not travel-related.Online retailer Amazon said it has pulled more than 1 million products for price gouging or falsely advertising effectiveness against the coronavirus.Meanwhile, state and health officials maintain there is no need to panic."We've seen an increase of cases in the United States over the weekend," U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Monday. "I want folks to understand that we knew this was coming, we told folks that this was going to happen and it is why we've been preaching preparedness from the very start."He added, "Caution is appropriate, preparedness is appropriate, panic is not."CNN and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Your pet can't catch coronavirus. Here's why one dog tested positive
.W
While dogs can test positive for the virus, it doesn't necessarily mean they have been infected.

They're your furry best friend and a fixture of your home — but could your beloved cat or dog catch and spread the coronavirus?Experts agree, almost definitely not.Why then did one dog in Hong Kong test positive for coronavirus last week?Here's what happened:Last Friday, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said that samples from the dog's nasal and oral cavities had tested "weak positive" for novel coronavirus. It was believed to be the first time that a dog anywhere in the world tested positive for the virus.The dog — which had no symptoms — was put into quarantine and will be repeatedly tested until the result comes back negative, according to the statement. The department "strongly advises" that pets of people infected with coronavirus are quarantined for 14 days.Despite this, the AFCD and the World Health Organization both agree there is no evidence that pets such as cats or dogs can be infected with coronavirus.That's because while dogs can test positive for the virus, it doesn't necessarily mean they have been infected.So why would a dog test positive?We know that coronaviruses can live on surfaces and objects, although researchers don't know exactly how long this virus can linger for.This is such a concern in mainland China that the central bank has been deep cleaning and destroying potentially infected cash.In the same way, coronavirus could be present on the surface of a dog or cat, even if the dog or cat hasn't actually contracted the virus.

Experts believe that both SARS and Covid-19 likely originated in bats.Dogs and cats do get coronaviruses — but they are not at all the same as the virus associated with this current outbreak, said Jane Gray, Hong Kong SPCA's chief veterinary surgeon.

Gray said if dog owners are particularly concerned, they can wipe their dog's paws with antiseptic wipes after they have had a walk outside -- but they should take care not to overdo it, as wiping too much can dry out a dog's paws."I am certainly not in any concern of my dog or cats, I'm far more concerned about myself catching it from a human being that has the disease," said Gray, who is a pet owner herself.What's the bigger risk?To veterinarians and animals rights experts, there is a bigger issue than the potential spread of coronavirus to pets: the spread of fear.After the announcement that the Hong Kong dog tested positive last week, the Lifelong Animal Protection Charity (LAP) — a group which helps rehome animals in Hong Kong —wrote to the government, saying its announcement caused "a tremendous amount of panic."Related video: U.S. sees price hikes, shortages amid coronavirus fears McClelland, the founder of LAP, said she had been contacted by "countless people" worried for their pets, with many anxious that their dog or cat would be forcibly sent to quarantine."In a state of panic, people could abandon or kill their pets," she said. "Other people could stigmatize people who have dogs. Dog owners could face unreasonable problems when simply walking their pets outdoors or neighbors could create trouble for no reason."Back in 2003, there were reports of cats in Beijing being taken from the owners and killed by people worried that they could be harboring the disease, according to a New Scientist report. In Hong Kong, there was an increase of abandoned pets, said McClelland.In Wuhan — the Chinese city at the center of the epidemic and which has been under lockdown for over a month — pets have been trapped in apartments alone while their owners are stuck outside the city. Volunteers from Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association said they have rescued hundreds of pets left in apartments.Furry Angels Haven, a group that works to rescue homeless and neglected pets in Wuhan, said that "without a doubt" there had been an increase in abandoned pets since the outbreak and that pets were being unfairly targeted.So far, Gray and McClelland haven't seen any sign of an increase in pet abuse or abandonment in Hong Kong. Instead, they've both seen an increase in people looking into steps to export their pets overseas — suggesting owners are looking to leave the city.Why pets are worth keepingRather than pets being a coronavirus culprit, they are actually good to have around in this stressful period when many people are stuck working or studying from home, says Gray.Pets are likely happy to have extra time with their owners, and can help lower people's blood pressure and ease the feelings of stress, she said. "We know that stress lowers our immunity, and no one right now wants their immunity lowered," she added.That's been the case for Hong Kong resident Marco Leung, who has a 7-year-old pet dog. He's not worried about his dog getting sick from coronavirus — although he has been taking precautions such as cleaning his dog after walks."I know dogs will not be infected, but if the virus goes on their skin or fur, it will stay there. So if we are careful, I think it's OK," he said. He's been working from home, so he gets to spend the whole day with his pet Hung Jai, which means "little bear" in Cantonese."Working from home is very very boring, so now I have more time for us to play together," he said.Related video: What does coronavirus self-quarantine mean?                        They're your furry best friend and a fixture of your home — but could your beloved cat or dog catch and spread the coronavirus? Experts agree, almost definitely not.                              Advertisement                       Why then did one dog in Hong Kong test positive for coronavirus last week? Here's what happened: Last Friday, Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said that samples from the dog's nasal and oral cavities had tested "weak positive" for novel coronavirus. It was believed to be the first time that a dog anywhere in the world tested positive for the virus. The dog — which had no symptoms — was put into quarantine and will be repeatedly tested until the result comes back negative, according to the statement. The department "strongly advises" that pets of people infected with coronavirus are quarantined for 14 days. Despite this, the AFCD and the World Health Organization both agree there is no evidence that pets such as cats or dogs can be infected with coronavirus. That's because while dogs can test positive for the virus, it doesn't necessarily mean they have been infected. So why would a dog test positive? We know that coronaviruses can live on surfaces and objects, although researchers don't know exactly how long this virus can linger for. This is such a concern in mainland China that the central bank has been deep cleaning and destroying potentially infected cash. In the same way, coronavirus could be present on the surface of a dog or cat, even if the dog or cat hasn't actually contracted the virus. The AFCD is testing to see whether the dog has been infected with the virus or if it has just been contaminated with the virus. "Present evidence suggests that dogs are no more of a risk of spreading (coronavirus) than inanimate objects such as door handles," wrote Sheila McClelland, the founder of Hong Kong-based Lifelong Animal Protection Charity (LAP), in a letter to the Hong Kong authorities, which she shared with CNN.

How the coronavirus is different than the flu                          Is it worth quarantining pets?

More than 5,300 people on two cruise ships quarantined in Asia amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
Ships are considered particularly at risk from outbreaks, due to the close living quarters of passengers and crew.

More than 5,300 people are being quarantined on two cruise ships off Hong Kong and Japan amid concerns passengers and crew were inadvertently exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus by infected passengers.People aboard both ships are being given health screenings, and those with suspicious symptoms are being tested for the virus that has quickly spread throughout mainland China and beyond.The Diamond Princess is anchored off the coast of Yokohama, near Tokyo, with 1,045 crew and 2,666 passengers, including 428 Americans, on board.The second ship, the World Dream, is docked at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Cruise Terminal with 1,800 people on board, the city's Department of Health said Wednesday.Concerns about potential infection among thousands of passengers at sea exposes the vulnerability of cruise ships to viral illnesses, like the coronavirus. The threat also raises questions about the durability of Asia's booming leisure cruise industry, which counts the elderly as among its most loyal customers.Older people are especially susceptible to the Wuhan coronavirus -- China's National Health Commission said Tuesday that 80% of all fatalities in mainland China were over the age of 60.The virus has infected more than 20,000 people in mainland China and nearly 200 worldwide across 25 countries and territories. It has claimed 492 lives worldwide, all but two in mainland China.Cruise companies worldwide have vowed to enact extra measures to protect their customers from infection, with several barring passengers who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days.Ships are considered particularly at risk from outbreaks, due to the close living quarters of passengers and crew. Researchers are still unsure exactly how the coronavirus spreads and how infectious it is.Chinese officials had previously said that patients can be infectious even if they are not presenting symptoms. An early study on asymptomatic transmission of the virus published last week in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine appeared to confirm Chinese health officials' assessment.But public health officials now say the report may be flawed. Interviews with the Chinese patient at the center of the study revealed she may have actually had mild, nonspecific symptoms.An important factor yet to be determined is whether the Wuhan coronavirus spreads via the fecal-oral route, like norovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to Dr. John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at the University of Hong Kong.Norovirus is a contagious stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhea that is notorious for infecting cruise passengers.Viruses like norovirus spread so quickly on cruises because "you've got so many people in a crowded area and people are sharing areas, touching places," Nicholls said.14 days on boardJapanese Health Minister Katsunoby Kato said Wednesday 10 people on board the Diamond Princess had been infected and taken to hospitals.The cruise operator, Princess Cruises, said in a statement the infected passengers include one American, two Australians, three Japanese and three Hong Kong citizens. One Filipino crew member is also ill, the statement said.  The rest of the passengers on board will remain under quarantine for at least 14 days, "as required by the Ministry of Health," the cruise company's statement added.The cases were detected after medical officials went room-to-room to check each guests' temperature and condition, Japan's health ministry said in a statement. Those who showed symptoms were subject to further testing.More passengers than expected needed to be temporarily quarantined while being tested, the statement said. More than 100 test results are still pending, it added. The company also said the first phase of screening of all the passengers on board has been completed.Spencer Fehrenbacher, a traveler on the ship, told CNN he was tested because he complained about a sore throat and fever last week. He said swabs were taken of the left and right side of his throat.Fehrenbacher, a U.S. citizen living in Tianjin, China, and studying for a masters degree there, said he was in good spirits. He is on the cruise with his roommate from Tianjin and two other friends."The Princess crew has been incredible in their support and communication up to this point," he said. "They're providing complimentary internet to everyone on board to ensure that everyone is able to communicate with family and friends."Questions in Hong KongThree former passengers who took a World Dream cruise from Jan. 19 to 24 to Vietnam tested positive for the coronavirus after they'd left the ship, the ship's operator, Dream Cruises, said in a statement.The company said 4,482 passengers and 1,814 crew members were on board for that voyage.Before boarding, all passengers received what the company called "stringent temperatures checks" at Nansha, Dream Cruises said.Anyone who had a fever was then tested for the coronavirus by the Nansha Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All tests came back negative at the time, Dream Cruises added.The passengers on that journey disembarked at two stops, in Nansha in southern China and in Hong Kong, on Jan. 24 after the cruise to Vietnam, the Hong Kong Department of Health said at a news conference Wednesday.The crew stayed on and the World Dream then picked up a different set of passengers before arriving in Hong Kong Wednesday morning, Hong Kong authorities said.Dream Cruises' statement said that once it found out about two of the three infected passengers Monday, it sealed off the cabins where they had been staying. The company said it found out about the first case on Sunday through "Chinese media sources."The current group of passengers got on for another itinerary, but the exact stops are unclear. Dream Cruises and its parent company, Genting Hong Kong, did not reply to CNN's phone calls and emails seeking clarification.The World Dream departed the southern Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung for Hong Kong on Feb. 4. Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare said the World Dream docked there but passengers were not allowed to leave.In the meantime, Dream Cruises said it was attempting to contact all the passengers who had been on the Jan. 19 to 24 cruise "to inform them of the situation and to remind them to seek professional medical assistance at their local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or health authorities should any symptoms arise or if they have any questions.""Crew members that worked in the affected cabins have also been isolated in their crew quarters with daily temperature checks and, since 24 January onwards, there have been no virus-related health issues among any members of its crew," the company said.Hong Kong's Health Department said Wednesday some 30 members of the crew reported feeling sick, but all are in stable condition. Three who reported fevers are in isolation in a Hong Kong hospital for further testing.

Is it safe to eat food that's been delivered? Can a microwave kill coronavirus?

Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, an infectious disease specialist, answered some of the most frequently asked questions about food safety amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The coronavirus has forced us to question every aspect of our lives we took for granted. From door handles to delivered food, everything and anything can start to feel like a possible contamination. Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, took questions from Mark Albert, chief national investigative correspondent for WCVB. Albert asked some of the most frequently asked questions about the coronavirus, called COVID-19, relating to food. Here are her answers:If people are trying to stock up here for food, what should they know about reusable bags, single-use bags?"Send the person who does not have any symptoms," Dionne-Odom advised. "Bring a bag that is not one that you frequently reuse. Discard the bag when you get back home. And while you're shopping, really just touch the things that you're ready to purchase. Don't touch anything that you don't want to buy."Can the virus be killed with heat? If you put delivery food in the microwave, will that make it safe?"I have good news," Dionne-Odom said, "which is that we have no documented cases of coronavirus being transmitted in food. It's not like typhoid or something else or a cholera. That said, though, you touch (the container it came in.) As soon as you get the food, come into your house to put it into a separate container that's clean. Then throw away the container that it came in and wash your hands very carefully."Is it safer if only one person runs the errands for the family?"I think it is important to also designate one person who is going to be doing the shopping," Dionne-Odom said. "Why expose multiple people in the household?"                        The coronavirus has forced us to question every aspect of our lives we took for granted.

Shelter in place, self-isolation, quarantine: What the terms mean and how they differ
.W
They all have the goal of keeping others from getting infected.

Isolation, quarantine, shelter in place: These are terms we're hearing a lot of these days as authorities try to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus that's sweeping the United States and the rest of the world.They're not the same thing, though they all have the goal of keeping others from getting infected.

How long will Americans be fighting the coronavirus?
.W
How long will all of this last?

In a matter of days, millions of Americans have seen their lives upended by measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.Normally bustling streets are deserted as families hunker down in their homes. Many of those who do venture out try to stay a safe distance from anyone they encounter, even as they line up to buy now-precious commodities like hand sanitizer. Parents juggle childcare as schools close, perhaps for the rest of the school year. And restaurants and bars sit empty as more and more convert to delivery-only options. How long will this last? Scientists say there isn’t a simple answer. “In many ways, this situation is unprecedented – we’re trying to take some actions to curb the spread and timing of this pandemic,” said Stephen Morse, a disease researcher at Columbia University in New York. Yes, there have been past disease outbreaks that scientists can draw some lessons from but, in those cases, the disease was largely allowed to run its course. "So those models don’t precisely apply,” Morse said.On Monday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. may be managing the outbreak through July or August. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said  the state’s number of coronavirus cases may peak – not end – in 45 days. The overall message is that the country will be fighting the virus outbreak for a matter of months, at least, not days or weeks. Each model of how the disease could spread relies on data and assumptions about population dynamics, demographics, health care capacity and other factors, said Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University. The challenge for designing models of what will happen next in the U.S. is that limited testing for COVID-19 means researchers don't know what the starting point is — how many people are already infected.In simplest terms, scientists say that the epidemic will slow when people with infections don't pass the virus on to others. “Basically, if I infect one other person or more ... then the epidemic can take off. If I infect less than one person and everybody infects less than one person, then the epidemic will decline," said Elizabeth Halloran, a disease researcher at the University of Washington. Based on data from China and from cruise ships, scientists estimate that unless measures are taken to limit the spread, each infected person will infect about 2 or 3 others, leading to an exponential growth of the virus. If the virus makes a jump to a new person every two to five days, as scientists calculate, then a single infected person could lead to 4,142 total infections within a month — assuming nothing is done to break chains of transmission. Unless such measures are put in place, scientists estimate that between 40% and 80% of the global population could become infected. Based on an analysis of data from China, scientists found that the majority of new infections are transmitted by people with mild symptoms who may not even know they're ill, said Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University. Even if most people recover and only a fraction of total infections are severe enough to require hospitalization — about 14%, scientists estimate — the sheer scale of the epidemic will put enormous strain on hospitals, healthcare workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed. Scientists now agree that measures to break or slow the chains of transmission are crucial to ensure that emergency rooms aren’t quickly overwhelmed by surges in critically ill patients. If measures like closing schools are successful in slowing disease spread, “we are going to see a hump instead of a peak” in new cases, U.S. government disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a White House briefing. In order words, the number of infections will rise more gradually and manageably. But that also means the duration of the outbreak will be prolonged. “The point of the restrictions we have is actually to stretch this out even longer. We don’t want a big peak to come very quickly,” said Mark Jit, a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It’s not like a Hollywood movie with a clear ending where everyone is saved, or everyone dies, quickly."So how does this end? Most scientists believe the fight against COVID-19 won’t be over until there’s an effective vaccine. But Fauci and other experts say it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be ready for widespread use. “The best-case scenario is that we have vaccine in 12 or 18 months and then our lives go back to normal,” Jit said. “The worst-case scenario it takes a long time for a vaccine to be developed, and the world is really changed and our lives aren’t the same again.”While we wait, are we all shut-ins for more than a year? Almost no one thinks that’s realistic. “I don’t think we can maintain social distancing as it is right now for the duration of the epidemic,” said Michael Levy, a University of Pennsylvania disease researcher. What may be more feasible is a plan for intermittent restrictions and enhanced monitoring to control the disease, an idea explored in a new study from researchers at Imperial College London. Once the number of new cases falls below a certain threshold, schools, offices and restaurants could reopen. But if the number of infections spikes again, restrictions would be reinstated. “The analogy of pumping car brakes on an icy road is what we should be thinking about,” Levy said. “You push on the brakes to slow things down, then ease up – but if you skid, you have to pump the brakes again.”             WASHINGTON

A 'Love Is Blind' parody is trying to help people find love in the social distancing era

"Love Is Quarantine" is "Love Is Blind" for the social distancing era.

With social distancing protocols in place as the coronavirus sweeps the nation, people all around the country are stuck inside their homes and getting restless.Dating, among other facets of life, has come to a standstill. But Thi Q. Lam and Rance Nix, two roommates who share an apartment in Brooklyn, are hard at work trying to spark love and provide some entertainment in these trying times -- with their own version of the hit Netflix reality series "Love Is Blind."Enter "Love Is Quarantine": an online dating project conducted through Instagram and Google Sheets.It's an antidote to both the boredom brought on by coronavirus-induced social isolation and the absence of human connection that people are currently feeling." lonely, they're looking for connection, they're looking for community, and most importantly, they're looking for love," Lam, 27, told CNN."That doesn't stop during a pandemic. People still want love, and we're going to try our best to make that happen."How it works"Love Is Quarantine" is "Love Is Blind" for the social distancing era.For the uninitiated, the hit Netflix series, hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, places male and female contestants in "pods" where they can talk to each other -- but not see each other. Only when the couples decide they want to get married can they reveal themselves and find out what the other looks like.In "Love Is Quarantine," potential contestants sign up through Google Sheets, providing their first name, age, sex, sexuality, city and phone number. (The project, unlike the show it's inspired by, is LGBTQ+ friendly.) Nix goes down the list and reaches out to people, confirming whether they'd like to participate and moving on if he doesn't hear back almost immediately. If the person responds and is down, Lam puts them in one of the 12 "pandemic pods."Both Lam and Nix, a.k.a. "obviously" Nick and Vanessa Lachey, then introduce the couple via a text conversation. They offer up a few conversation starters, like where the person is from, how they found out about the project and their ideal date after social distancing is finally over. Then, the two strangers are free to go on their "date," which typically takes the form of a phone conversation."In 2020, I think texting is the predominant form of communication and we want to get back to the grassroots and treat it just like the show 'Love is Blind,'" Nix, 28, said. "Because essentially, people are in the pods. The pods are in your apartment, and we want people to communicate and test that vibe over the phone."The contestants are asked to film themselves before the date, while they're on the date and after the date, describing what they think about the other person -- much like the drama-laden, confessional style of "Love Is Blind."Lam and Nix then record those clips being played back on a monitor and upload them to the "Love Is Quarantine" Instagram page. So as not to spoil the surprise, they cover up the contestant's face in the shot with their hand -- sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Often, Lam and Nix interject with their own commentary.It's raw, unfiltered and refreshing.If the couple hits it off, Lam and Nix reveal their faces on the "Love Is Quarantine" Instagram page and the two are free to keep talking and see where things go.And if they don't, there's always the next person.How it started"Love is Quarantine" is not even a week in, but it's quickly taking off.Lam proposed the idea to Nix on Tuesday around 5 p.m., he said.Lam, who produces content for food and beverage startups, and Nix, an actor and real estate agent, both have jobs that have since come to a halt because of the coronavirus outbreak. And as self-proclaimed "extreme extroverts" in self-isolation, they couldn't sit still.About an hour after the idea was born, "Season 1" was already in motion, with participants soon in their "pods" and chatting away on the phone.After 12 hours, Lam said the Google spreadsheet was flooded with about 300 people, from places as far as Australia and South Korea.As of this writing, the Instagram page has more than 8,600 followers and counting.And already, fan favorites have emerged.Brooke and Red, two people who clicked on Tuesday night, have since earned the couple hashtag #Bred. Steve and Katie, a couple who supposedly "talked all night," have been dubbed "Skatie."There's also a fan gossip tab on the Google spreadsheet and another to submit "Questions for the Lacheys," meaning Lam and Nix. The dating action continued with "Season 2" on Wednesday night and the two said they plan to keep it going for as long as they can.Lam and Nix said they had a feeling their project would go viral, and they wanted to pay it forward. They said they're partnering with others to create "Love Is Quarantine" merch -- all the proceeds of which will go to Feeding America, a nonprofit organization that has been providing food to people through the uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus outbreak."We're doing all right," Lam said of him and Nix. "And there's a lot of people out there that aren't doing so good. So we hope that this is more than a just funny, entertainment thing, that we can actually help real people."Meanwhile, they're also making bigger plans for the "Love Is Quarantine" couples who experience a spark.On the Netflix show "Love Is Blind," the couples who make it out of the pods are flown to a resort in Mexico, where they spend the "honeymoon" period of their engagement getting to know each other in person.On "Love Is Quarantine," Lam said, couples will spend their honeymoon period at Popeye's.After the coronavirus lockdowns end, of course.

US and Mexico agree to limit non-essential travel across border to curb coronavirus spread

Mexico and the U.S. announced Friday they will sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as they try to control the spread of the coronavirus.

Mexico and the U.S. announced Friday they will sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as they try to control the spread of the coronavirus.Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said his government and the Trump administration have agreed to a plan that would prohibit recreational and tourist travel, similar to the restrictions put in place earlier this week along the U.S. and Canadian border.There would be no ban on people traveling for work or other essential activities and there would be no halt to commercial traffic, Ebrard said. It wasn't immediately clear when the restrictions would take effect.“Everyone else is not expected to have any difficulties," he added. "We're not talking about closing it.”Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf made the announcement during a White House press conference Friday."The United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travels across our shared border. Both our countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus," U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. "We'll continue to maintain a strong supply chain across our border," Wolf said.By excluding commercial traffic from the ban, the two governments substantially softened the economic effects. Fewer Americans are also heading south because of a statewide stay-at-home order in California and a State Department warning advising Americans not to travel abroad.Still, the restrictions are a major development along the world's most heavily crossed border.Wolf told reporters at the White House that the restrictions were aimed at eliminating non-essential travel across that border.“We want to make sure that cargo continues, trade continues, heath care workers continue to be able to traverse that border. But tourism, some recreational activities and other things needs to stop during this crisis," he said.Ebrard said Thursday he proposed steps to Pompeo that “won't paralyze economic activity and keep the border open to commerce and work.”U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials briefed business leaders Thursday on the plans to prohibit non-essential travel with Mexico, said Paola Avila, chair of the Border Trade Alliance, a business group.U.S. officials provided a long list of “essential” workers that would be unaffected going to and from their jobs, including farm workers, restaurant and grocery store employees and bus drivers, said Avila. Mexico was preparing similar restrictions on visitors from the United States.Keeping trade flowing, as the U.S. and Canada agreed to do, contains the economic damage. Mexico is the U.S.'s largest trading partner, just ahead of Canada. The U.S. accounts for about 75% of Mexican exports, including autos, computers and medical devices.While halting travel for students, shoppers, families and many workers would be a major blow to border economies, the impact has already been felt.The State Department on Thursday issued a new travel alert urging Americans not to go abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home, restricting nonessential movements.“People are not crossing anyway,” said Avila, who is also the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce vice president for international business affairs. This is the right thing to do. If you don’t have to cross, don’t.”The U.S. has also been considering whether to immediately turn back to Mexico anyone who crosses the border illegally, including asylum-seekers. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he planned to announce such a measure “very soon,” relying on a law that says he can deny entry to people or reject cargo if the U.S. surgeon general determines there is a "serious danger" of bringing a communicable disease to the United States.

A Tulsa pastor with no known underlying health problems is the first person to die from COVID-19 in Oklahoma.

A Tulsa pastor with no known underlying health problems is the first person to die from the coronavirus in Oklahoma. Merle Dry, 55, worked for Metro Pentecostal Church for more than 20 years before his death. Metro Pentecostal Church said Dry was in good health before he died. He was fighting a cold before he contracted the virus on Tuesday, according to the church. He caught pneumonia as a complication from COVID-19 and passed away on Wednesday. Don Martin, senior pastor at Metro Pentecostal Church, confirmed the man's identity to KTUL.Martin said Dry had a big impact on the area. Dry was not at church the Sunday before he died, but he was there the week before. He was not in the main area of the church building.Dry's wife, Carrie, is a teacher at Edison Preparatory School. She and their two children, 22-year-old Jesse and 17-year-old Pamela, are being quarantined at this time. The Oklahoma State Health Department confirmed Dry tested positive on Tuesday and passed away Wednesday.              TULSA, Okla.

Italy sees biggest day-to-day rise in coronavirus deaths
.W
The soaring numbers come despite a national lockdown that drastically limits when residents are allowed to leave their homes.

Italy has recorded its highest day-to-day-rise in the number of deaths of people infected with the new coronavirus.Civil Protection Chief Angelo Borrelli said Friday the country recorded 627 more deaths in the 24 hours since Italy surpassed China on Thursday as the nation with the most COVID-19-related deaths. The total now stands at 4,032.Authorities said most of the people who died had existing health problems such as heart disease and diabetes before they were infected with the virus.Borrelli says Italy also saw a staggering increase of 5,986 cases from a day earlier, bringing the official total in Italy to 47,021.The soaring numbers come despite a national lockdown that drastically limits when residents are allowed to leave their homes. Police have issued citations to thousands of people for being out and about without valid reasons, such as going to work or shopping for food.Mayors and governors throughout the country have been demanding even stricter measures. Italy's national government is widely expected to respond soon.For days now, Italian authorities have said at daily briefings that the virus outbreak that emerged in northern Italy four weeks ago could reach its peak in a matter of days and the number of new infections might start going down.Borrelli addressed the question Friday by saying, "We'll never know when the peaks will be" in advance. He noted that some experts have spoken of cases peaking "the next week or the week after" that.             ROME

Video: Man uses drone to walk his dog, practice social distancing

A man found a creative way to practice social distancing, but still take his dog for a walk.

While it is not believed your pet could contract the novel coronavirus, they can still carry the virus on their fur or skin. This has made the daily walk, once a leisurely chore, now a task to worry over. Vakis Demetriou, a local resident of Cyprus which is currently in a government-mandated lockdown, found a creative way to practice social distancing, but still take his dog for a walk. In the video, Demetriou’s dog, Oliver, walks along an empty street as it is guided by a drone. The camera pans to show Demetriou operating the drone from the balcony. In a Facebook post, Demetriou advised other pet owners to consider their pets in the pandemic, as well.“5th day quarantine. Stay home safe but don’t forget your dog’s happiness.” Watch the video above!

How smoking, vaping and drug use might increase risks from COVID-19
.W
Because COVID-19 attacks the lungs, those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape may be especially threatened, according to a health expert.

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 recommendations to specifically target older adults and people with serious underlying medical conditions. They labeled this group as "higher risk."However, another group of people could be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and hasn't received as much attention: people who smoke, vape or have substance use disorders."he research community should be alert to the possibility that  could hit some populations with substance use disorders particularly hard," Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse wrote in a blog post published last week.Because COVID-19 attacks the lungs, those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape may be especially threatened, Volkow said."When someone's lungs are exposed to flu or other infections the adverse effects of smoking or vaping are much more serious than among people who do not smoke or vape," Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control & Education at University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a blog post updated Tuesday."Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia which push foreign things out...he ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised," Glantz said in a phone interview.The CDC reported on Wednesday that young adults under age 44 make up a big part of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S., and Glantz questions whether the vaping epidemic might have contributed to this."Some of my pulmonary  have noted people under 30  ending up in hospitals and a couple were vapors," Glantz said. However, he said, there hasn't been enough research or evidence to support whether there's a link.People who smoke are generally at an increased risk of serious complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, when they have a severe infection.The odds of a COVID-19 case becoming more severe -- and at the most extreme, leading to death -- were 14 times higher among people who had a history of smoking compared to those who did not smoke, Glantz said, citing a study from China published in the peer-reviewed Chinese Medical Journal in February. The study also found those with a history of smoking had a 14% higher risk of developing pneumonia.Concerns about other drugsBesides smoking and e-cigarettes, Volkow wrote that people who abuse opioids and methamphetamine may be at risk for serious complications of COVID-19 because of the effects these drugs have on respiratory and pulmonary health.Opioids slow breathing and have already been shown to increase mortality in people with respiratory diseases, according to Volkow. "hus diminished lung capacity from COVID-19 could similarly endanger this population," she said.Methamphetamine has been shown to produce significant pulmonary damage since it binds heavily to pulmonary tissue, Volkow explained in a phone interview. This will likely increase the risk of negative outcomes if used during a COVID-19 infection.People with substance use disorders also rely on treatment that traditionally involves human interaction, such as therapy sessions or methadone clinics, which will be challenging in the setting of wide-spread social distancing, according to Dr. Allison Lin, assistant professor in psychiatry and the addiction center at the University of Michigan.Lin said it's important for everyone to quit smoking due to its unknown -- but potentially serious -- effects on COVID-19 patients. This is particularly important for people with substance use disorders since they are more likely to smoke, she said.For everyone infected with COVID-19, one thing people can do now to reduce the risk of serious illness is quitting smoking, according to Glantz."At a time when people are looking to reduce risk, it's very sensible to stop insulting your lungs," he said.

Legendary country singer Kenny Rogers dies at age of 81
.W
With his silver beard and folksy charm, the Grammy winner excelled as a musical stylist for more than six decades.

Actor-singer Kenny Rogers, the smooth, Grammy-winning balladeer who spanned jazz, folk, country and pop with such hits as "Lucille," "Lady" and "Islands in the Stream" and embraced his persona as "The Gambler" on record and on TV died Friday night. He was 81.He died at home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, representative Keith Hagan told The Associated Press. He was under hospice care and died of natural causes, Hagan said.Video above from 2017: Kenny Rogers on alpacas, gambling and why he loves Dolly PartonThe Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records, won three Grammys and was the star of TV movies based on "The Gambler" and other songs, making him a superstar in the '70s and '80s. Rogers thrived for some 60 years before retired from touring in 2017 at age 79.Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer. "You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don't invite comparison," Rogers told The Associated Press in 2015. "And I chose that way because I could never be better than Johnny Cash or Willie or Waylon at what they did. So I found something that I could do that didn't invite comparison to them. And I think people thought it was my desire to change country music. But that was never my issue."A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings.As a 20-year-old, he had a gold single called "That Crazy Feeling," under the name Kenneth Rogers, but when that early success stalled, he joined a jazz group, the Bobby Doyle Trio, as a standup bass player. But his breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk group, in 1966. The band reformed as First Edition and scored a pop hit with the psychedelic song, "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)."Rogers and First Edition mixed country-rock and folk on songs like "Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town," a story of a Vietnam veteran begging his girlfriend to stay. After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad "Lucille," in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy.Suddenly the star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade. "The Gambler," the Grammy-winning story song penned by Don Schlitz, came out in 1978 and became his signature song with a signature refrain: "You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."The song spawned a hit TV movie of the same name and several more sequels featuring Rogers as professional gambler Brady Hawkes, and led to a lengthy side career for Rogers as a TV actor and host of several TV specials. Other hits included "You Decorated My Life," "Every Time Two Fools Collide" with Dottie West, "Don't Fall In Love with a Dreamer" with Kim Carnes, and "Coward of the County." One of his biggest successes was "Lady," written by Lionel Richie, a chart topper for six weeks straight in 1980.Richie said in a 2017 interview with the AP that he often didn't finish songs until he had already pitched them, which was the case for "Lady.""In the beginning, the song was called, 'Baby,'" Richie said. "And because when I first sat with him, for the first 30 minutes, all he talked about was he just got married to a real lady. A country guy like him is married to a lady.So, he said, 'By the way, what's the name of the song?'" Richie replies: "Lady."Related video: Dream House of the Week: Kenny Rogers' flip projectOver the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably, Dolly Parton.She posted a video to social media Saturday after hearing the news."I loved Kenny with all my heart. My heart's broken, and a big, ole chunk of it has gone with him today," Parton said.The two were paired at the suggestion of the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb, who wrote "Islands in the Stream.""Barry was producing an album on me and he gave me this song," Rogers told the AP in 2017. "And I went and learned it and went into the studio and sang it for four days. And I finally looked at him and said, 'Barry, I don't even like this song anymore.' And he said, 'You know what we need? We need Dolly Parton.' I thought, 'Man, that guy is a visionary.'"Coincidentally, Parton was actually in the same recording studio in Los Angeles when the idea came up."From the moment she marched into that room, that song never sounded the same," Rogers said. "It took on a whole new spirit."The two singers toured together, including in Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and 1987, and were featured in a HBO concert special. Over the years the two would continue to record together, including their last duet, "You Can't Make Old Friends," which was released in 2013.Parton reprised "Islands in the Stream" with Rogers during his all-star retirement concert held in Nashville in October 2017. Rogers invested his time and money in a lot of other endeavors over his career, including a passion for photography that led to several books, as well as an autobiography, "Making It With Music."He had a chain of restaurants called "Kenny Rogers Roasters," and was a partner behind a riverboat in Branson, Missouri. He was also involved in numerous charitable causes, among them the Red Cross and MusiCares, and was part of the all-star "We are the World" recording for famine relief.By the '90s, his ability to chart hits had waned, although he still remained a popular live entertainer with regular touring. Still he was an inventive businessman and never stopped trying to find his way back onto the charts. At the age of 61, Rogers had a brief comeback on the country charts in 2000 with a hit song "Buy Me A Rose," thanks to his other favorite medium, television.Producers of the series "Touched By An Angel" wanted him to appear in an episode, and one of his managers suggested the episode be based on his latest single. That cross-promotional event earned him his first No. 1 country song in 13 years. Rogers is survived by his wife, Wanda, and his sons Justin, Jordan, Chris and Kenny Jr., as well as two brothers, a sister and grandchildren, nieces and nephews, his representative said.The family is planning a private service "out of concern for the national COVID-19 emergency," a statement posted early Saturday read. A public memorial will be held at a later date. Rogers died of natural causes, according to his family.

The coronavirus forces us to question every surface as a potential hazard. Can the virus spread on clothing or through mail?

Across the world, the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, forces us to question every surface as a potential hazard. Many worry even their mail may be a risk. Mark Albert asked Dr. Leana Wen, former health commissioner of Baltimore, about mail and clothing safety in the coronavirus age.Is it safe to collect the mail?Wen: It is. Now, it is possible that you could get coronavirus by touching surfaces and especially hard non-porous surfaces like doorknobs, elevator buttons and then somebody else touches it, and you're infectious, they could get it too. But getting it from the mail, getting it from things that have been exposed to the outside for a long time, it's extremely unlikely. There have not been documented cases (of that.) I would say, again, the most important thing that we can do, I know we hear this over and over again, is hand-washing, but also keeping a safe distance from someone else is the best way to protect yourself.Can the virus be transferred on clothes?Wen: It could be. Although the type of soft, porous surface like clothes are, the virus will live on it for a much shorter period of time than it would on a hard, non-porous surface. As you wash your clothes, wash it with hot water, with detergent. But make sure also that it's not just your clothes that you're washing. Because if you are dumping things into a hamper and that's an aluminum container or some other container, (make sure) that there is a liner in there too — either a disposable liner that you can throw away, or something that you could also launder.

Target announces wage increase, bonuses amid spike in demand from coronavirus outbreak
.W
In addition to wage increases and bonuses, Target has announced a new paid leave program, contributions to a relief fund that assists employees most affected by the coronavirus and donations to organizations responding to the outbreak worldwide.

With essential supplies in high demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, Target has announced wage increases for its employees, a new paid leave program, bonuses and relief fund contributions.The Minneapolis-based company issued a news release Friday that says employees will receive $2 more per hour until at least May 2. For employees who are 65 or older, pregnant, or have underlying medical conditions, Target is offering paid leave. The $2-per-hour increase for store and distribution center employees will mean an average earning increase of $240 to $480. Target officials say they will work with current teams to offer extra hours, but pursue additional hiring where it's needed. Target employees who are 65 or older, pregnant or have underlying medical conditions have access to paid leave for 30 days. This policy is in addition to Target expanding backup care for employees, waiving its absenteeism policy and covering quarantine and confirmed illness pay during the outbreak.  Target officials also said bonuses ranging from $250 to $1,500 will be paid to nearly 20,000 hourly department leaders in stores across the country.  "We continue to experience incredible demand across our business, and Target’s ability to help our guests in this unprecedented time would not be possible without the strength of our team," said Brian Cornell, CEO of Target. "I am proud and humbled by the dedication and humanity they show to our guests every day. Increasing their compensation for a job incredibly well done and ensuring continued compensation for those who need to care for themselves and their families is a reflection of our company’s values and simply the right thing to do."In addition, Target officials said $1 million will be donated to the Target Team Member Giving Fund to help employees most impacted by the coronavirus. This fund was established in 2018 to support employees during hardship.   “Families across the country are counting on Target in so many ways during this pandemic, and our team has been nothing short of remarkable,” Cornell said. “The commitments we’re making today will provide additional resources for our most valuable asset — our team, their families and the communities impacted by the coronavirus.”  In addition to the $1 million donation to the Target Team Member Giving Fund, Target and the Target Foundation have committed an additional $9 million to assist organizations helping respond to the coronavirus. That donation will assist nonprofit organizations in proximity to Target stores, national organizations including Feeding America, and global organizations, such as UNICEF, the company's news release says.

Target officials also said bonuses ranging from $250 to $1,500 will be paid to nearly 20,000 hourly department leaders in stores across the country.   "We continue to experience incredible demand across our business, and Target’s ability to help our guests in this unprecedented time would not be possible without the strength of our team," said Brian Cornell, CEO of Target. "I am proud and humbled by the dedication and humanity they show to our guests every day. Increasing their compensation for a job incredibly well done and ensuring continued compensation for those who need to care for themselves and their families is a reflection of our company’s values and simply the right thing to do."                                                                                                       How to grocery shop safely during the coronavirus outbreak                          In addition, Target officials said $1 million will be donated to the Target Team Member Giving Fund to help employees most impacted by the coronavirus. This fund was established in 2018 to support employees during hardship.    “Families across the country are counting on Target in so many ways during this pandemic, and our team has been nothing short of remarkable,” Cornell said. “The commitments we’re making today will provide additional resources for our most valuable asset — our team, their families and the communities impacted by the coronavirus.”   In addition to the $1 million donation to the Target Team Member Giving Fund, Target and the Target Foundation have committed an additional $9 million to assist organizations helping respond to the coronavirus.  That donation will assist nonprofit organizations in proximity to Target stores, national organizations including  Feeding America , and global organizations, such as  UNICEF , the company's news release says.

At least 30 cruise ships are at sea right now. Here's what it's like on board
.W
Thousands of passengers are still at sea aboard more than 30 oceangoing cruise ships, some still hunting for a port that will accept them amid a global shutdown of the cruise industry and mounting fears of infection.

Texan newlyweds Jay and Carmen Martinez went straight from celebrating their beachside wedding to embarking on a globe-trotting honeymoon cruise across the South Pacific on board the Norwegian Jewel.Ahead of the Feb. 28 departure date in Australia, the couple had worried about the spread of coronavirus but didn't have the option to cancel the 23-day trip they'd booked two years earlier.Now they are among thousands of passengers still at sea aboard more than 30 oceangoing cruise ships, some still hunting for a port that will accept them amid a global shutdown of the cruise industry and mounting fears of infection.The Norwegian Jewel is believed to be heading for Hawaii, but there's no official word on its final destination and the ship has already been turned away from several ports."We had hesitations," Jay Martinez tells CNN Travel about their preboarding apprehension. The couple looked into amending their plans but were told they were locked in."Up until the day that we left, that was not an option," he said. "And with us having so much money invested into our honeymoon, we had no other choice but to board the ship."The couple feared their itinerary might be curtailed, but they never expected that they'd end up stranded at sea, their ship scrambling for a place to dock.Escalating situationThey're not the only ones.As coronavirus outbreaks afflicted numerous ships on at sea, the Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, made the decision on March 13 to suspend operations from U.S. ports of call for 30 days.CLIA encompasses 38 cruise companies, making up more than 95% of global cruise capacity -- a total of 277 ships."A handful of ships — about 14% of the total CLIA fleet — are currently at sea completing their journeys," the organization said in a statement to CNN. "Our members are focused on bringing these ships safely back to port as soon as they can."Among the 30 or so still at sea, Norwegian Jewel is heading toward Honolulu, Hawaii, but no one's quite sure whether it'll be allowed to dock there.Right from the outset, it was clear some ports were closed and some plans would have to be changed, Jay Martinez said.The situation escalated dramatically about a week ago when CLIA recalled its ships, and French Polynesia turned the Norwegian Jewel away.At first, the ship planned to head to Fiji instead and disembark there, but this plan was abandoned en route when the island country said the cruise liner would not be accepted. New Zealand followed suit.The ship was subsequently allowed to refuel in American Samoa."And that is when we started our long journey to Hawaii," Jay said.Cruise operator Norwegian has yet to give official confirmation of the ship's final destination. In response to a query from CNN, a spokesperson confirmed that a plan to dock in New Zealand had been scrapped."We will share an update as it becomes available," they said.On board, Jay says guests have been riding waves of emotion — relief when hearing of an imminent destination followed by disappointment when the plans were abandoned.So far everyone on board the Norwegian Jewel is well, with no cases of coronavirus or quarantined passengers.Still, Jay says guests are concerned and highly anxious, with tensions rising as the ship's trajectory became increasingly uncertain.Everyone's aware, he said, that there's a real possibility that this could continue for days or weeks.There are worries about medication running out, the health of friends, families and livelihoods back home.Related video: Couple back home in Alabama after cruise ship quarantine nightmarePacific princessOn the other side of the Pacific ocean, 76-year-old Ron Ernst has been playing a waiting game on board the Pacific Princess, a 338-cabin cruise liner with capacity for 670 guests.Ron and his wife, Susie, boarded the ship on Jan. 20 in Los Angeles. The retired Californian couple have enjoyed more than 25 cruises, including three round-the-world voyages.They left U.S. shores ready for another global adventure, embarking on their 111-day cruise odyssey barely aware of the mounting coronavirus threat."I am sure we had heard about some virus in China, but we had no concerns," Ron said.It was toward the end of February that they became aware the virus might impact their itinerary.The ship skipped calls at the Indonesian island of Bali, Singapore and the Thai resort of Phuket. Passengers were also banned from exiting the ship in Sri Lanka.Like the Norwegian Jewel, the Pacific Princess is healthy — with no cases of coronavirus — but has still been riding a tide of uncertainty."The second night after Sri Lanka, the captain made the shocking announcement that, in view of the developing and quickly changing conditions, the cruise would terminate in Fremantle/Perth," Ron said. "We quickly realized that things were getting serious."The ship made an 180-degree turn in the middle of the night, and began the 18-day sail back to Australia.It finally arrived Saturday morning local time."Life on the ship continued with great food, entertainment and lots of socializing," says Ron."The crew is absolutely fantastic. Their future is completely uncertain, but they are not letting it show. Princess has done an amazing job, especially considering these unprecedented conditions."Asked about the status of the vessel and those on board, Princess Cruises directed CNN to an online statement confirming the final destination and offering a helpline for friends and family.On board the Pacific Princess, Ron Ernst said passenger moods fluctuated. It was mostly fear of the unknown that concerned them.In fact, some were dreading returning to a reality that's become far from "normal.""We were healthy and comfortable as long we are in our safe cocoon," Ron said. "Not everyone is looking forward to getting back to the world."Also on board the Pacific Princess was 63-year-old CJ Hayden, an author and business coach based in San Francisco.Hayden, traveling with partner Dave Herninko, told CNN earlier this week that she just hopes to get home ASAP, in case further travel restrictions are put into place."Our biggest concern now is whether we can still get home to North America before airports, cities, or even borders are closed," she said. "The ship can't go any faster."There were 547 passengers on board, and 448 are American. Princess Cruises said it has made flight arrangements for each passenger and paid for air fare.Anyone unable to fly because of medical reasons will stay on the ship as it sails on to Los Angeles.Australia had previously announced it was closing its ports to cruise ship passengers. Hayden said Pacific Princess passengers have been granted permission to disembark on the understanding they head to the airport right away.Those not booked on flights on March 21 will stay on board until their flight is ready to depart the next day."Almost all the passengers are seniors, with many in their 70s and 80s, and quite a few with disabilities," said Hayden earlier in the week."Some folks are bearing up well; others are freaking out," she said.Like Ron, Hayden said "uncertainty" was the hardest thing to deal with.Staying connectedOn board the Norwegian Jewel, Jay, who works in public affairs, is trying to keep busy by remote-working from the ocean.Carmen, who works in disease prevention, isn't able to telework. As some of the younger and more tech-savvy guests, both are trying to aid older passengers." helping out, getting in touch with family members that are having trouble connecting via internet or phone with those that are on this ship," Jay said.He praises crew members also stuck on board and unsure of the future, highlighting their "phenomenal job of cleanliness and sanitary efforts" — and their consistent generosity and understanding."There's a lot of frustrated people, and it's quite unfortunate that they get the brunt of the effects of what the corporate cruise line's shortcomings are, because they've just done a great job," Jay said.Uncertain timesRight now, those on board the Norwegian Jewel are crossing their fingers that they'll be allowed to disembark in Hawaii on Sunday, but Jay said they have received no clear information about how they'll be getting home from the island."That uncertainty and that unknown and ambiguity of what our fate is going to be, I think, is the hardest thing to stomach," he said.Much of the travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic — hoteliers are laying off workers, airlines are appealing for government bailouts and cruise ships are hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons.So would Jay and Carmen Martinez ever get on board a cruise again?Jay's diplomatic— no one quite knows what the travel landscape is going to look like in six months or a year, he said. Plus, he hopes the cruise lines will put in new practices to deal with situations like this one."I wouldn't say that it has ruled it out for us in the future," he said. "I think it's a discussion we're going to have to have when we arrive home and the dust has settled throughout all of this."So much will be dependent on how this continues to unfold and what will be the cruise line's response after their 30 day pause, in relation to this outbreak."And despite being stuck at sea and unsure of when they'll see dry land again, there have been joyous moments on board.After all, Jay and Carmen have been celebrating their honeymoon. Thursday was their one-month anniversary."This has been a cruise and a vacation and a honeymoon like no other, and for great reasons and for terrible reasons," Jay said.They're enjoying the on-board camaraderie, everyone's come together both despite, and because of, the difficult circumstances."We're very much bonded together. I think that we find solace in one another by finding humor in our situation, and conveying concerns from our various countries and sharing that news," Jay said.CJ Hayden shares similar stories from the Pacific Princess."Some of us have been helping each other learn new skills," she said. "Two volunteers have been helping me and others learn watercolor painting. Another passenger has been teaching my husband how to use the gym equipment. We've taught several folks how to play chickenfoot dominoes."The memory that will stick with her, she said, is when the ship stopped in Sri Lanka to refuel."On the pier next to the ship were soldiers with guns and dogs, and workers unloading supplies wearing masks and gloves. At 10 a.m., the passenger chorus gathered on the pool deck and belted out 'Put on a Happy Face.' "Jay said he's proud of the way passengers and crew have collaborated in the face of uncertainty."It's a beautiful thing, because I feel at times our world is very separated," he said."It's great to feel like we can take a stance in this pandemic as a global initiative, and I think that we have our own little minicommunity that represents just that — that we are looking our for one another.We are concerned about each other's wellbeing and we want to make sure that everyone gets home, not just one nationality."

As offerings dwindle, some churches fear for their future amid coronavirus outbreak

Churches across the U.S. are bracing for a painful drop in weekly contributions and possible cutbacks in programs and staff as the coronavirus outbreak diminishes attendance.

As in-person worship services are canceled or downsized amid the coronavirus outbreak, some churches across the U.S. are bracing for a painful drop in weekly contributions and possible cutbacks in programs and staff. One church leader, Bishop Paul Egensteiner of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America’s Metropolitan New York Synod, said some of the 190 churches in his region were unlikely to survive because of a two-pronged financial hit. Their offerings are dwindling, and they are losing income from tenants such as preschools that can no longer afford to rent church venues.“As much as I’d like to help them, everybody's reserves are taking a hit because of the stock market,” Egensteiner said,At Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, a mostly African American congregation of about 1,100, the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. bucked the cancellation trend by holding services last Sunday. But attendance was down by about 50%, and Gwynn said the day’s offering netted about $5,000 compared to a normal intake of about $15,000.Related video: How coronavirus may change Easter service at some churches“It cuts into our ministry,” he said. “If this keeps up, we can’t fund all our outreach to help other people.” There was a brighter outcome at the Church of the Resurrection, a large United Methodist Church congregation that operates out of five locations in the Kansas City area. Cathy Bien, the church’s communications director, said about 25,700 people logged in to join online worship last Sunday after in-person services were canceled. That compared to normal Sunday participation of 14,000 worshippers -– 8,000 in person and 6,000 online.“It blew our minds,” Bien said. “They were coming from all over the country -– a lot of Methodists from other churches.”The huge turnout didn’t translate into a larger than normal offering, although the church is still processing checks that were sent by some of the worshippers, Bien said. She expressed hope that financial support will remain robust as the church stresses the need to bolster food pantries and other community programs in the face of COVID-19.At Trinity Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, Virginia, giving was down modestly last weekend as the church canceled in-person worship and made the service available online.The pastor, Walter Kim, said some of his roughly 1,000 congregants have grown accustomed to online giving in recent years, but many worshippers still give in person at the services - an option not available for now.“We’ll be asking them to sign up (for online giving) or mail a check,” said Kim. He will be urging congregants to bolster the church’s “mercy fund” for use assisting hard-up members of the community as job losses multiply.In addition to his pastoral duties, Kim is president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents more than 45,000 evangelical churches. The NAE will be co-hosting a two-day digital summit next week featuring videos from church leaders advising other pastors nationwide how to respond creatively and effectively to the virus outbreak.The co-host is the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College in Illinois, which already has offered resources to churches in response to COVID-19.“Some changes are going to be required,” Kim said. “The church is a very creative institution. In the end it will find ways of fulfilling its mission.”In western Massachusetts, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield has indefinitely canceled all public Masses and recently rescinded permission for parishioners to pray individually at their churches.Funeral Masses were still allowed with a maximum attendance of 25; the diocese said the times of those Masses were not to be shared in the media.“Lack of access to the churches and Eucharist is particularly difficult for many older parishioners whose entire daily routine is built around getting up, out of the house, and going to Mass,” said the Rev. Mark Stelzer, who has served in the diocese as a parish priest and college chaplain.The Rev. William Tourigny, pastor of Ste. Rose de Lima Church in Chicopee, Massachusetts, said his parish had a solid financial foundation and expected it could maintain all programs and staff payroll for the time being. “For smaller faith-based communities with little or no reserved funds, difficult decisions will need to be made,” he said.Joe Wright, executive director of the Bivocational and Small Church Leadership Network in Nashville said many pastors in the network have been holding regular in-person services while monitoring the spread of the virus. “Once the coronavirus rises to the level where it starts hitting smaller groups, then we’ll see even the smaller groups back away and seek ways to gather, probably electronically,” he said.When that happens, Wright said, financial giving will depend on the church, especially the age of the congregations. “Some churches with older congregations do not give electronically so the transition to that will be a little bit harder,” he said.Ron Klassen, executive director of the Rural Home Missionary Association, said it’s too early to say how the rural churches he represents are being impacted."My sense is that in the past, people rise up, and if anything, the giving might increase,” he said. “People are going to give. They’ll take care of their church and their community.”In Baltimore, Gwynn worries that tensions might rise past the point that church outreach programs can help.“With all the uncertainty, I’m afraid this could turn into anarchy,” he said. “Not everybody’s patient. Not everybody’s law-abiding.”He even envisioned the possibility of a stampede toward the goods being doled out after the church’s annual food drive.“My biggest fear right now is what's happening to the minds of our people,” Gwynn said. “How long can we hold them together?"

Their offerings are dwindling, and they are losing income from tenants such as preschools that can no longer afford to rent church venues.                              Advertisement                       “As much as I’d like to help them, everybody's reserves are taking a hit because of the stock market,” Egensteiner said, At Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, a mostly African American congregation of about 1,100, the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. bucked the cancellation trend by holding services last Sunday. But attendance was down by about 50%, and Gwynn said the day’s offering netted about $5,000 compared to a normal intake of about $15,000.

Cathy Bien, the church’s communications director, said about 25,700 people logged in to join online worship last Sunday after in-person services were canceled. That compared to normal Sunday participation of 14,000 worshippers -– 8,000 in person and 6,000 online. “It blew our minds,” Bien said. “They were coming from all over the country -– a lot of Methodists from other churches.” The huge turnout didn’t translate into a larger than normal offering, although the church is still processing checks that were sent by some of the worshippers, Bien said. She expressed hope that financial support will remain robust as the church stresses the need to bolster food pantries and other community programs in the face of COVID-19. At Trinity Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, Virginia, giving was down modestly last weekend as the church canceled in-person worship and made the service available online. The pastor, Walter Kim, said some of his roughly 1,000 congregants have grown accustomed to online giving in recent years, but many worshippers still give in person at the services - an option not available for now. “We’ll be asking them to sign up (for online giving) or mail a check,” said Kim. He will be urging congregants to bolster the church’s “mercy fund” for use assisting hard-up members of the community as job losses multiply. In addition to his pastoral duties, Kim is president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents more than 45,000 evangelical churches. The NAE will be co-hosting a two-day digital summit next week featuring videos from church leaders advising other pastors nationwide how to respond creatively and effectively to the virus outbreak. The co-host is the  Humanitarian Disaster Institute  at Wheaton College in Illinois, which already has offered resources to churches in response to COVID-19. “Some changes are going to be required,” Kim said. “The church is a very creative institution. In the end it will find ways of fulfilling its mission.” In western Massachusetts, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield has indefinitely canceled all public Masses and recently rescinded permission for parishioners to pray individually at their churches. Funeral Masses were still allowed with a maximum attendance of 25; the diocese said the times of those Masses were not to be shared in the media. “Lack of access to the churches and Eucharist is particularly difficult for many older parishioners whose entire daily routine is built around getting up, out of the house, and going to Mass,” said the Rev. Mark Stelzer, who has served in the diocese as a parish priest and college chaplain. The Rev. William Tourigny, pastor of Ste. Rose de Lima Church in Chicopee, Massachusetts, said his parish had a solid financial foundation and expected it could maintain all programs and staff payroll for the time being.  “For smaller faith-based communities with little or no reserved funds, difficult decisions will need to be made,” he said. Joe Wright, executive director of the Bivocational and Small Church Leadership Network in Nashville said many pastors in the network have been holding regular in-person services while monitoring the spread of the virus.  “Once the coronavirus rises to the level where it starts hitting smaller groups, then we’ll see even the smaller groups back away and seek ways to gather, probably electronically,” he said. When that happens, Wright said, financial giving will depend on the church, especially the age of the congregations.  “Some churches with older congregations do not give electronically so the transition to that will be a little bit harder,” he said. Ron Klassen, executive director of the Rural Home Missionary Association, said it’s too early to say how the rural churches he represents are being impacted. "My sense is that in the past, people rise up, and if anything, the giving might increase,” he said. “People are going to give. They’ll take care of their church and their community.” In Baltimore, Gwynn worries that tensions might rise past the point that church outreach programs can help. “With all the uncertainty, I’m afraid this could turn into anarchy,” he said. “Not everybody’s patient. Not everybody’s law-abiding.” He even envisioned the possibility of a stampede toward the goods being doled out after the church’s annual food drive. “My biggest fear right now is what's happening to the minds of our people,” Gwynn said. “How long can we hold them together?"

Calls for vote-by-mail system rise with stay-at-home orders

Election officials and voting rights advocates across the country have been pushing for a radical change to how Americans exercise their most fundamental right in the face of an unprecedented health crisis.

Election officials and voting rights groups are calling for a general move to an all vote-by-mail system for remaining primaries and the November general election as the spread of the novel coronavirus continues to shut down major cities and states across the U.S.Ellen Weintraub, one of three current members of the Federal Election Commission and its former chairwoman, said this week that voting by mail is a "necessary and urgent" step in the face of the pandemic."As Congress and the White House race to save American lives and preserve America's economy, they must also act swiftly to protect America's democracy," Weintraub said in a statement Thursday. "No one should have to risk their life — or the lives of their loved ones — to cast their vote." She joined a chorus of election officials and voting rights advocates across the country who have been pushing for a radical change to how American exercise their most fundamental right in the face of an unprecedented health crisis.Voters in Illinois who participated in that state's presidential primary this past week were met with health precautions like the use of social distancing, hand sanitizer and wipes that led to long lines and delayed start times at polling locations.Currently, five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah — conduct elections entirely by mail, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while another 28 states and the District of Columbia offer "no-excuse" voting by mail.Some officials have moved to make emergency changes going forward. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs on Wednesday sent a letter to state lawmakers asking them to authorize all-mail elections for August, when the state holds a local primary, and for the November general election.Hobbs' letter came days after a county election official in Arizona, Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, tried to implement all-mail voting for Democratic primary voters at the last minute in the presidential primary but was stopped short by a last-minute lawsuit filed by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.Texas Democrats filed a lawsuit Friday, demanding a declaratory judgment that grants all eligible voters who believe their health is in danger under the threat of COVID-19 the ability to cast their ballots by mail if they choose, according to a news release. The case was filed in Travis County, which is home to the state's capital of Austin, against Secretary of State Ruth Hughes and Travis County Clerk Dana Debeauvoir.Berks County, in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, passed a legally nonbinding resolution Thursday pressuring Gov. Tom Wolf and the state Legislature to allow the "election to occur entirely through absentee and mail-in ballots in order to prevent the need to vote in person." "I just want to do the job right. We just want to have the right supplies and what we need to have a successful election, and for each day that goes by, we are running out of time," Deborah Olivieri, election director for Berks County, told CNN.Pennsylvania is still scheduled to hold its presidential primaries April 28, along with Delaware, New York and Rhode Island. Two other states that were supposed to hold their primaries the same day, Connecticut and Maryland, have decided to postpone until June. Voting rights groups have also started focusing their efforts on getting states to quickly change to a vote-by-mail system. RepresentUs, a democracy reform group, this week launched a campaign to push more states to a no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail option."We know that the virus isn't going to go away soon. Right now we are trying to mitigate the surge that will overrun the medical industry, the hospitals, but we know that this virus is going to be around for many months," Josh Silver, director and co-founder of RepresentUs, told CNN."So we need a system in place so that everyone in this country can vote from home in 2020," Silver said.The expansion of stay-at-home orders may add to the pressure on election officials to make the change.California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday night ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay home. At the time of the order, at least 19 people had died and more than 900 tested positive for coronavirus in California. The order will remain in place until further notice.Los Angeles County, the largest voting district in the nation, is weighing the feasibility of sending vote-by-mail ballots to all registered voters, according to Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for the county registrar."Our department as a whole, of course, will put the safety and health of the community as our No. 1 priority," Sanchez told CNN. "If our department is asked by either the state or the Legislature is asked to produce vote-by-mail ballots to everyone to ensure the health and safety of everyone in the county, then we are absolutely going to abide by that."

This week in coronavirus news

The far-reaching effects of the coronavirus continued this week, causing cancellation of major events, travel restrictions and a national emergency declaration for the United States.

There are more than 132,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in 123 countries and territories, according to the World Health Organization. With more than 1,665 cases in the United States, at least 41 Americans have died from the virus, which was declared a pandemic by the WHO this week. Also this week, the White House, Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court temporarily closed public tours and major sports organizations suspended or delayed their seasons. Travel restrictions into the U.S. went into effect and major entertainment venues, including Broadway, Disneyland and Disney World, announced a halt in activities. On Friday, President Donald Trump held a press conference declaring the outbreak a national emergency. Here's a look at what's occurred this week as it relates to the coronavirus:Trump declares virus a national emergency  Speaking before the nation, President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency. He urged every state to set up emergency centers to combat the virus. "Only the beginning," Trump described the declaration as. He then asked every hospital in the nation to activate its emergency preparedness plan. Trump conferred broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Doctors and hospitals will have maximum flexibility to respond to the virus. Hospitals can now use telehealth, diagnosing patients over the phone, allowing for remote doctor's visits as well as allowing doctors from different states to diagnose patients.Hospitals can now waive requirements for limits on beds, keeping as many patients in their facilities as they feel they are able to. They also have no restrictions on space or rooms used to house patients, where previously there were restrictions on numbers of patients per room.Essentially, hospitals are free to respond to the virus in whatever way they see fit. "No resource will be sparred,"  Trump said.A new partnership with the private health sector to accelerate testing for the virus would be employed, though Trump insisted Americans not to overuse it.“We don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it," he said. "And we don’t want everybody running out and taking — only if you have certain symptoms." Half a million new tests are expected by next week.  Trump waived interest on all student loans held by the federal government "until further notice." Trump also issued drive-thru testing sites to be set up to make coronavirus tests available faster. People can get tests without leaving their vehicles.He instructed creating large reserves of oil for future use in case of shortages. America's responseBefore Trump's national emergency declaration, the stock market halted trading on two occasions, states across the country cancelled classes and a ban on all travel from Europe went into effect. The Grand Princess cruise ship, which housed 21 passengers who tested positive for COVID-19, also docked in Oakland, California this week, starting a 14-day quarantine for other passengers and crew members. The U.S. government also issued further guidance throughout the week.  Notable casesSeveral notable figures confirmed this week that they had tested positive for coronavirus, including Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife. False informationMisinformation seems to be spreading nearly as quickly as the virus itself. This week, false narratives about COVID-19 continued to earn clicks across the internet. CancellationsFrom sports organizations to religious services, people are being encouraged to avoid large gatherings to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Many large companies also encouraged employees to work from home, made sick leave available or made modifications to normal operations. International effectsItaly put a nationwide lockdown in place this week, while China started to see signs the outbreak has begun to dissipate.Preparations beginPeople began stockpiling supplies, avoiding public places and monitoring possible symptoms this week as more information about the virus emerged. Helpful tipsFrom rescheduling planned travel to staying healthy, there are plenty of ways to navigate the evolving changes stemming from the spread of the coronavirus.

Vice President Mike Pence, wife test negative for coronavirus, spokeswoman says

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife have tested negative for coronavirus, a spokeswoman announced Saturday.

Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for coronavirus, his spokeswoman announced Saturday evening.Pence had said he and his wife would be tested Saturday afternoon after a staff member of his office had tested positive for coronavirus."Given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon," Pence said during a news conference at the White House.His office announced Friday that one of its members tested positive for the coronavirus -- the closest confirmed case to Pence that is publicly known.Pence told reporters Saturday that his staffer who tested positive for coronavirus is "doing well," had "mild" cold-like symptoms for a day and a half, and has not been at the White House since Monday.He reiterated neither President Donald Trump nor himself had direct contact with the staff member, and said that health authorities have traced his contacts. Trump has already tested negative for the virus, the White House said last week.Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed to Americans that they do not have to get tested if they are not displaying symptoms in order to preserve resources.195,000 Americans tested, more masks orderedPence also announced that more than 195,000 Americans have been tested for the virus as cases surpass 22,000 with about half confirmed in New York.He noted that the number does not include county hospitals or health care labs around the country. Currently, only 19,343 tests have come back positive, Pence said.Pence said that US Department of Health and Human Services "is completing a half billion dollar order of the (N95) masks."The purchase is being coordinated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the federal government is responding specifically to state requests, he said.He said Apple would be donating 2 million industrial masks and working with the administration to distribute them. The company's CEO confirmed the donation later Saturday, saying Apple was sourcing supplies for health care providers in the US and Europe.Pence also urged businesses to donate as many N95 masks as they could spare to local hospitals.Fauci said that there are multiple avenues available for hospitals to acquire personal protective equipment through FEMA.Pressed on a timeline, Fauci said the supplies would be delivered "sooner than weeks.

These companies are making them right now," Trump said.Asked by CNN why doctors and nurses don't have the medical equipment they need, Trump said that "many administrations preceded me and for the most part they did very little in terms of what you're talking about."He went on to say, "We are making much of this stuff now, and it's being delivered now."Trump says Congress close to deal on stimulus bill Trump also told reporters on Saturday that Congress is close to reaching a deal on a proposal for the next stimulus bill to deal with the pandemic."They're all negotiating, and everybody is working hard, and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution. I think we're getting very close," Trump said.Trump said he's "strongly recommending a buyback exclusion" for companies in the legislation.On Saturday, congressional and administration negotiators entered a crucial day in the effort to deploy more than $1 trillion in emergency stimulus to a staggering economy, with a growing consensus on a final agreement, but a handful of significant hang-ups still needed to be resolved.Bipartisan groups of senators worked late into Friday night with top officials from Trump's administration to lock in a final agreement -- a deal that people directly involved in the negotiations tell CNN could top a cost of $1.5 trillion -- before falling short of a midnight deadline imposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser to Trump, went even further on the overall scope of the package Saturday, telling reporters it could top $2 trillion.                        Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for coronavirus, his spokeswoman announced Saturday evening.            Pleased to report that the COVID-19 test results came back negative for both Vice President  @Mike_Pence  and Second Lady  @KarenPence . — Katie Miller (@VPPressSec)  March 22, 2020                                           Advertisement                       Pence had said he and his wife would be tested Saturday afternoon after a staff member of his office had tested positive for coronavirus. "Given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon," Pence said during a news conference at the White House. His office announced Friday that one of its members tested positive for the coronavirus -- the closest confirmed case to Pence that is publicly known. Pence told reporters Saturday that his staffer who tested positive for coronavirus is "doing well," had "mild" cold-like symptoms for a day and a half, and has not been at the White House since Monday. He reiterated neither President Donald Trump nor himself had direct contact with the staff member, and said that health authorities have traced his contacts. Trump has already tested negative for the virus, the White House said last week. Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed to Americans that they do not have to get tested if they are not displaying symptoms in order to preserve resources. 195,000 Americans tested, more masks ordered Pence also announced that more than 195,000 Americans have been tested for the virus as  cases surpass 22,000  with about half confirmed in New York. He noted that the number does not include county hospitals or health care labs around the country. Currently, only 19,343 tests have come back positive, Pence said. Pence said that US Department of Health and Human Services "is completing a half billion dollar order of the (N95) masks." The purchase is being coordinated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the federal government is responding specifically to state requests, he said. He said Apple would be donating 2 million industrial masks and working with the administration to distribute them. The company's CEO  confirmed the donation  later Saturday, saying Apple was sourcing supplies for health care providers in the US and Europe. Pence also urged businesses to donate as many N95 masks as they could spare to local hospitals. Fauci said that there are multiple avenues available for hospitals to acquire personal protective equipment through FEMA. Pressed on a timeline, Fauci said the supplies would be delivered "sooner than weeks. It is going to be days, I would hope." Trump also said that while he has signed the Defense Production Act, he has not used it to ramp up production of personal protective equipment because "we have so many companies making so many products." "We have the act to use in case we need it," Trump said. He mentioned Hanes as a company that is voluntarily manufacturing masks and claimed that Ford and General Motors have begun making ventilators. "I had three calls yesterday directly, without having to institute like you will do this. These companies are making them right now," Trump said. Asked by CNN why doctors and nurses don't have the medical equipment they need, Trump said that "many administrations preceded me and for the most part they did very little in terms of what you're talking about." He went on to say, "We are making much of this stuff now, and it's being delivered now."

"They're all negotiating, and everybody is working hard, and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution. I think we're getting very close," Trump said.

Iran to temporarily free 54,000 prisoners as coronavirus spreads
.W
Pressure has been mounting on Iranian officials to take action against the virus as the death toll and number of cases rapidly shoots up.

Iran will temporarily release 54,000 people from prisons and deploy hundreds of thousands of health workers as officials announced a slew of measures to contain the world's deadliest coronavirus outbreak outside China.Pressure has been mounting on Iranian officials to take action against the virus as the death toll and number of cases rapidly shoots up. Iran has reported 92 deaths, as 586 new infections were reported overnight, bringing the total up to 2,922, state media reported.The country has also come under pressure as Middle Eastern nations, including Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have reported cases with links to the Iranian city of Qom, where several holy sites are regularly visited by large crowds.After weeks of refusing to restrict visits to the sites, the government said Wednesday that those trying to leave the city would be quarantined if they showed symptoms of the virus, including a fever. Medical teams will begin taking temperatures of those trying to leave, according to Qom University of Medical Science's Deputy Dean Ali Abrazi. He also said the university was building a field hospital to tackle the outbreak, according to state media.Iranian officials initially reassured its nationals that the virus would be contained, but it was difficult to convince Iranians that was the case as 23 members of parliament tested positive for the virus and an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died Monday.Iran's First Vice President Eshaq Jahanghiri issued an order to government ministries, with the exception of the foreign ministry, suspending travel to international conferences and gatherings until further notice, state media reports.Questions had swirled over whether the government was being transparent in reporting case numbers, as the high death toll reported several days ago suggested infection numbers should have been much higher than officials had confirmed.Health system under stressIranian Deputy Health Minister Ali Reza Reisy announced Tuesday that a nationwide team of 300,000 health workers and specialists would be deployed to prop up the country's health care system.There are growing concerns that Iran's health services are ill-equipped to respond effectively to the growing number of cases. Although the system has improved in recent decades, crippling sanctions have hampered its development.Doctors in the country had told CNN before the outbreak that Iran was struggling to keep up with soaring prices of medications and medical instruments because of sanctions.International organizations are now looking at how to fill the gaps in the system. The World Health Organization sent a team to Iran on Monday as well as its first planeload of assistance."The plane carrying the technical team members also contained a shipment of medical supplies and protective equipment to support over 15,000 health care workers, as well as enough laboratory kits enough to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people," the WHO said in a statement.Iran said the WHO supplied eight tons of medicines and test kits via a UAE military aircraft from Dubai as well as six teams of epidemiologists, physicians and laboratory tests specialists, state-run IRNA reported.Britons stuck in Iranian jailsIran's Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said the health ministry would oversee the release of prisoners, semi-official news agency ISNA reported. He did not elaborate on where they would be kept or how authorities would keep track of them."The health of the prisoners is very important for us regardless of their status as security prisoners or regular prisoners," Esmaili said.It was also unclear whether Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother jailed in Iran on espionage charges, would be among those released.Zaghari-Ratcliffe believes she has contracted coronavirus in Evin prison outside Tehran, according to a family statement released Saturday.On Tuesday, Iran's ambassador to the United Kingdom Hamid Baeidinejad tweeted that Zaghari-Radcliffe did not have coronavirus, amid calls for her to be tested.He added that she may be granted a furlough Wednesday or Thursday to join family in Tehran. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe told CNN her release had not yet happened.The UK's foreign office said in a statement: "We're following up the Iranian ambassador's comments on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and are urgently seeking clarification from the Iranian Government on her situation."It also called for information from Iran on reports that the virus was spreading in Evin prison and to "immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there."People in Iran are among those in many countries panic-buying goods in case the outbreak worsens. The country is facing a shortage of hand sanitizers, as demand for the products soar.

Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, raised the alarm about the novel coronavirus in December. Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by police.

The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about the Wuhan coronavirus has died, according to several state media reports.Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, raised the alarm about the novel coronavirus in December, posting in his medical school alumni group on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients from a local seafood market had been diagnosed with a SARS-like illness and were quarantined in his hospital.Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police. He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, which has sickened more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560.Li was hospitalized on Jan. 12 after contracting the virus from one of his patients, and he was confirmed to have had the coronavirus on Feb. 1.On Thursday, the World Health Organization responded to news of Li's death on Twitter, writing: "We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did on #2019nCoV."The death toll and number of people infected by the Wuhan coronavirus continues to grow, with no signs of slowing despite severe quarantine and population control methods put in place in central China.The number of confirmed cases globally stood at 28,275 as of Thursday, with more than 28,000 of those in China. The number of cases in China grew by 3,694, or 15%, on the previous day. There have been 565 deaths so far, all but two of which were in China, with one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong.

A deputy approached the box, peered inside and to his surprise — he found two newborn bear cubs.Bears are no stranger to Camden County, Sheriff Kevin Jones said. But, he said finding cubs in a box was “a little strange.”Williams wasn’t sure why he was left to bear with the box of blanket-wrapped cubs, but they are out of his paws now.

Does getting coronavirus once mean you are immune?

Misinformation on the novel coronavirus can be found almost anywhere online, particularly about how to kill the virus or become immune.

Misinformation on the novel coronavirus can be found almost anywhere online, particularly about how to kill the virus or become immune. Mark Albert asked three doctors about the virus: Dr. Leana Wen, former health commissioner of Baltimore, infectious disease specialist Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Jesse Goodman, attending physician at Georgetown University. Here are their answers.Once you contract coronavirus, are you then immune from getting the disease again?Wen: It's a great question and it's one that we've been getting asked a lot from people who are concerned. So if this new coronavirus, COVID-19, behaves as we believe that it does, then someone who has gotten it should have developed immunity to it and therefore you should not get it again. And I just would emphasize that this is what we know as of right now. When Dionne-Odom was asked if a person could contract the virus twice, she agreed with Wen's statement, and reemphasized that the data still isn't robust.Dionne-Odom: There's some preliminary scientific data showing no. But the first case was first described at the end of November. So it's really too early to be sure whether or not re-infection is possible. The answer hopefully will be no.If and when a vaccine is made available, should everyone get vaccinated or only those who are sick?Goodman: One thing that could be considered is we may be able to use blood testing to identify people who've already been exposed and are immune. And if so, they might not need it. But right now, (if we weather the storm and get through the worst of the virus, and we see) amounts go down, but if there's not evidence that everybody is immune and the vaccine is available, it's something that would be used generally to help protect healthy people.

USA Track and Field, USA Swimming ask to postpone 2020 Olympics; IOC doesn't wish to cancel games

U.S. Olympic leaders face a growing rebellion after the USA Track and Field chief added to the call for a postponement of the Tokyo Games because of the mushrooming coronavirus crisis.

U.S. Olympic leaders face a growing rebellion after the USA Track and Field chief added to the call for a postponement of the Tokyo Games because of the mushrooming coronavirus crisis.On Sunday, the International Olympic Committee said it expects to make a decision within the next four weeks on possibly delaying the games. The committee's executive board also said that canceling the 2020 Tokyo Games would not solve any problems or help anybody.It comes after USA Track and Field CEO Max Siegel sent a two-page note to his counterpart at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, Sarah Hirshland, asking the federation to advocate for a delay. It came late Friday, only a few hours after USA Swimming's CEO sent a similar letter.In a letter released Friday on Twitter, Tim Hinchey III, CEO of USA Swimming, said he felt "compelled to speak out" about the pending games amid the worldwide coronavirus outbreak."As this global pandemic has grown, we have watched our athletes' worlds be turned upside down and watched them struggle to find ways to prepare and train — many for the biggest competitive opportunities of their lives," Hinchey's letter read. "Our world class swimmers are always willing to race anyone, anytime and anywhere; however, pressing forward amidst the global health crisis this summer is not the answer."Instead, Hinchey said "the right and responsible thing to do is to prioritize everyone's health and safety and appropriately recognize the toll this global pandemic is taking on athletic preparations," suggesting the games should instead take place in 2021.Hinchey added that athletes are under pressure, experiencing stress and anxiety "and their mental health and wellness should be among the highest priorities." Now, the sports that accounted for 65 of America's 121 medals and 175 of its 554 athletes at the last Summer Games are on record in urging, in Siegel's words, "the USOPC, as a leader within the Olympic Movement, to use its voice and speak up for the athletes."Other national committees are already doing that. The federations in Norway and Brazil each went public with requests to postpone. "Our clear recommendation is that the Olympic Games in Tokyo shall not take place before the COVID-19 situation is under firm control on a global scale," Norway's federation wrote in a letter to IOC President Thomas Bach. The U.S. brings the largest contingent to every Summer Games and wins the most medals — both factors that have led NBC to pay billions to televise the games through 2032.It would seem to give the USOPC leverage in talks about almost any subject with the IOC, but the federation has been reluctant to use its power. It spent years, in fact, trying to smooth over tense relations with its international partners. And since Hirshland took over as CEO in 2018, the focus has been inward, as the sex-abuse scandals that have consumed American sports have shifted the focus to athlete welfare and safety. Hirshland and the USOPC board chair, Susanne Lyons, were insistent that the USOPC won't sacrifice athlete safety in the current crisis. But they stopped well short of pushing the IOC toward a postponement. "The decision about the games does not lie directly with us," Lyons said in a conference call with reporters Friday. "It lies with WHO, the Japanese government and the IOC. Under no circumstance would the USOPC send athletes into harm's way if didn't think it was safe."Leaders of the track and swimming teams don't appear willing to take that risk, either, though whether they'll act on their own — without the signoff from the USOPC — remains in question. The leader of the third sport that makes up the backbone of the Olympics — gymnastics — has sent a survey to athletes, asking for their thoughts on what the USA Gymnastics stance should be.

"Our world class swimmers are always willing to race anyone, anytime and anywhere; however, pressing forward amidst the global health crisis this summer is not the answer."            USA Swimming respectfully requests that the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee advocate for the postponement of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.  pic.twitter.com/q5bhUwi05q — USA Swimming (@USASwimming)  March 20, 2020              Instead, Hinchey said "the right and responsible thing to do is to prioritize everyone's health and safety and appropriately recognize the toll this global pandemic is taking on athletic preparations," suggesting the games should instead take place in 2021. Hinchey added that athletes are under pressure, experiencing stress and anxiety "and their mental health and wellness should be among the highest priorities."                                                                                                       He was training for the Olympics. Now his future's in limbo.                           Now, the sports that accounted for 65 of America's 121 medals and 175 of its 554 athletes at the last Summer Games are on record in urging, in Siegel's words, "the USOPC, as a leader within the Olympic Movement, to use its voice and speak up for the athletes." Other national committees are already doing that. The federations in Norway and Brazil each went public with requests to postpone.  "Our clear recommendation is that the Olympic Games in Tokyo shall not take place before the COVID-19 situation is under firm control on a global scale," Norway's federation wrote in a letter to IOC President Thomas Bach.  The U.S. brings the largest contingent to every Summer Games and wins the most medals — both factors that have led NBC to pay billions to televise the games through 2032. It would seem to give the USOPC leverage in talks about almost any subject with the IOC, but the federation has been reluctant to use its power. It spent years, in fact, trying to smooth over tense relations with its international partners.  And since Hirshland took over as CEO in 2018, the focus has been inward, as the sex-abuse scandals that have consumed American sports have shifted the focus to athlete welfare and safety.  Hirshland and the USOPC board chair, Susanne Lyons, were insistent that the USOPC won't sacrifice athlete safety in the current crisis. But they stopped well short of pushing the IOC toward a postponement.  "The decision about the games does not lie directly with us," Lyons said in a conference call with reporters Friday. "It lies with WHO, the Japanese government and the IOC. Under no circumstance would the USOPC send athletes into harm's way if didn't think it was safe." Leaders of the track and swimming teams don't appear willing to take that risk, either, though whether they'll act on their own — without the signoff from the USOPC — remains in question. The leader of the third sport that makes up the backbone of the Olympics — gymnastics — has sent a survey to athletes, asking for their thoughts on what the USA Gymnastics stance should be.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were diagnosed with coronavirus March 11 and then self-quarantined in their home in Australia after they were released last week from a hospital there.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are feeling better after being treated for coronavirus and Hanks offered some advice to those sheltering in place."Hey, folks.

Birthday parades replace parties as creative neighbors adhere to physical distancing

Folks are finding new ways to celebrate special moments, even as concern about the spread of the coronavirus keeps people apart.

Friends honking, waving and holding signs out of open car windows have found a new way to celebrate special moments, even as concern about the spread of the coronavirus keeps people apart.In at least two recent examples, neighbors in Massachusetts have organized birthday parades in lieu of parties that were canceled in light of the ongoing health crisis. Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency in the Bay State on March 10 in response to COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus. Five days later, he ordered gatherings be limited to no more than 25 people.Guidance from the federal government suggests gatherings of no more than 10 people. Scott, from Sharon, said this forced his family to cancel the dinner they had planned for his wife's 40th birthday. Instead, he asked everyone to celebrate from a safe distance."I decided to reach out to our close friends, family members and neighbors and decided to surprise her with a corona-safe birthday parade," he wrote in a message to WCVB. "I thought maybe this would put some smiles on some faces during such a rough time."Kyle Goodwin said his friends had a similar idea for celebrating their son's birthday in Gloucester."We brought the party to him," Goodwin wrote.

Roles include store associates, home delivery drivers, distribution center employees and member/customer service professionals.

CVS Health has announced plans to hire 50,000 full-time, part-time and temporary roles across the country as the nation battles the coronavirus outbreak.Roles include store associates, home delivery drivers, distribution center employees and member/customer service professionals. The company will utilize a technology-enabled hiring process that includes virtual job fairs, virtual interviews and virtual job tryouts. The company is also awarding bonuses to employees who are required to be at CVS facilities to assist patients and customers. Bonuses will range from $150 to $500 and will be awarded to pharmacists and certain other health care professionals on the frontlines, store associates and managers and other site-based hourly employees, the company said.“Our colleagues have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to providing essential goods and services at a time when they’re needed most,” said Larry J. Merlo, president and CEO, CVS Health. “As they continue to be there for the individuals and families we serve, we’re taking extra steps to provide some peace of mind and help them navigate these uncertain times.” Working with the Bright Horizons network of national in-home and center-based daycare providers, employees will be able to take advantage of up to 25 fully covered days of backup care. This benefit will begin in early April for both full- and part-time employees.The company has made 24 hours of paid sick leave available to part-time employees for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paid sick leave is in addition to the 14-day paid leave the company is providing for any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or needs to be quarantined as a result of potential exposure. Other grocery and pharmacy chains have also recently announced plans to hire additional employees and improve benefits.   Supermarkets and pharmacies across the U.S. have been slammed as customers stock up on food and supplies, leaving stores struggling to resupply toilet paper and other staples.Public officials have urged against such panic buying, saying there's plenty to go around.

'Out of the greenhouse and into a dumpster': Flower farmers impacted during coronavirus outbreak
.W
This is a time of uncertainty and challenge for farmers who plan out and plant their crops out months in advance.

"If you can't sell, to be honest, there is really no point in harvesting the flowers. So we are taking the flowers out of the greenhouse and into a dumpster. It's very bleak. It's not nice at all," said Farai Madziva, vice president of sales and chief of staff with Kitayama Brothers Farms.  The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing flower farmers to run a skeleton staff; Kitayama Brothers in California is operating with 25% of its crew."Can our employees get back to an entity that still exists? They can say we are back home and continue growing," Madziva said. "Most of our employees have been with us for more than 20 years. When you look at that, we are family. Just letting people go and saying goodbye, and when they come back, the family is not there anymore. Those are the concerns; those are the worries; that is what we are trying to preserve."Flower farmers, although part of the group of essential businesses allowed to stay open in California, are a second tier compared to other essentials. "Some stores have decided to put less of an emphasis on flowers and use that area to continue to stock food and use the staff that handles flowers to continue to help stock food," said Dave Pruitt, CEO of  the California Cut Flowers Commission."People are running past the flowers and going after toilet paper is part of the problem, and that was the initial problem. Now the problem has become we can't get it to them even if they want to buy it."Allowed to stay open but having hardly anywhere to take the business, farmers are strategizing how to best transport their flowers as some truck companies are leaving several local farmers for major companies. "The grocery stores and the online sales are the only ones that are able to keep us going at this point in time," said Madziva. This is a time of uncertainty and challenge for farmers who plan and plant their crops months in advance. All eyes are now turning to Easter and Mother's Day sales.  "The question from our production team is, do we keep planting? What is the volume that we should plant? Everything that we are planting now is product that will come in July. We have reduced a very small amount. We are not sure. As farmers, we are always very optimistic," Madziva said.               WATSONVILLE, Calif.

The extrovert's guide to social distancing
.W
During the fight against COVID-19, extroverts will need to learn to create their own plans on how they might manage their own psyche as shelter-in-place orders become more commonplace.

If you're an extrovert and the thought of weeks or months of social distancing has you jumping out of your skin, rest assured. Your feelings are normal. And we're here to help."We are social beings," Jaime Blandino, a clinical psychologist in Decatur, Georgia, told CNN. "My most extroverted clients are having the hardest time."An extrovert is someone who gets his or her energy from other people. When they can't spend time with others, "they might not know what to do with themselves," she said.Blandino's practice has closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and she and her colleagues have moved to seeing all their clients through telehealth.Her message to her clients is simple: "It's normal to feel abnormal in a situation that's not normal.""I didn't know anybody who didn't feel a surge of anxiety when these new rules were introduced," she said.As the U.S. government prepares for a potential monthslong fight against COVID-19, extroverts will need to learn to create their own plans on how they might manage their own psyche as social distancing, quarantines and shelter in place orders become more commonplace.And if you're an introvert, quietly excited about the prospect of more alone time, there's a separate guide below on how you can make the most of social distancing. Use technology to connect with friendsYour "usual habits are going to be disrupted," said Gretchen Rubin, the author of "Outer Order, Inner Calm" and host of the "Happier" podcast. An important strategy is to "reimagine what you want and get out in front of it."In terms of social connection, "nothing can beat real life," she said, but the second best way to interact can be through images. There are plenty of apps offering video chat or live broadcast functions, ranging from Skype to House Party. You could use one to connect with a friend you haven't seen in awhile.She recommended "lots of touches" — virtually, of course — including writing physical cards to your friends, hosting a virtual family reunion and even basic lifestyle hacks like sending more voice memos rather than text messages."People have more time and they want to hear your voice," she said.Or you can create more group text message threads with friends and family, knowing that at any given moment, somebody on the thread might be free and able to write back.In Italy, where the whole country has been in lockdown for more than a week, throngs joined in a singing flash mob belting out the country's national anthem from their apartment balconies.No judgment if you want to round up your neighbors — through virtual means, please — and try the same."We could come out of this closer," Rubin said. "We're all going through something big together."Socially, we're living in a backward timeBlandino, the therapist, said that mental health professionals have traditionally advocated for in-person social experiences as antidotes to anxiety and depression, prizing real connections over virtual ones. That's now changing."Some of the things that we'll recommend now go against what we used to advise," she said. "We're in a backward time."And while her introverted clients may be feeling less stressed, and sometimes even emboldened by social distancing, Blandino said both extroverts and introverts can leverage technology to weather the storm.Another option to feel connected is to host watch parties and virtual movie nights, watching the same movie from different locations using Netflix.She even said you might consider keeping the TV on in the background with a familiar film or show from your childhood."Hearing human voices is soothing," she said.It's a time to shine for any technology offering a way to connect with others.The Bumble dating app is seeing a spike in how people are using the app to meet dates. a company spokesman said. That uptick includes a 21% uptick in video call usage, along with a separate 21% increase in what the company calls "quality chats" — in which two people have a more substantive back-and-forth.Practice physical distancing, not social distancingEven with social distancing, it's still important to to go for walks, take a bike ride or hang out near your neighbors, said Dr. Don Dizon, a professor of medicine at Brown University.Even if you're in an area that now must shelter-in-place, it's still fine to go out for a walk and feel the sun on your skin as long as you're keeping proper distance from others."There is no national lockdown," he said. "It doesn't say that you can't go outside."And, he advised picking apart the concept of social distancing to make it feel less scary.As physician and researcher Dr. William Dale has said, policies to contain COVID-19 are actually "physical distancing." There's still plenty of room to practice emotional and social connection, despite being physically separate.Dizon said he was finding time for online gaming. And he's been using Twitter, Instagram and TikTok to stay up to date with medical colleagues around the globe, sharing both funny videos and substantive scientific data.Find some time to readTo help relax, now might be a good time to start up a book club on Facebook, Dizon added.From Plato to Thoreau, generations of philosophers, poets and prophets have celebrated solitude, stillness and taking time to get to know thyself."Extroverts are very plugged in," Blandino said. "This is a time to practice slowing down and introducing new routines."There's no shortage of literature on that topic and taking a moment to sit quietly with a book you've always wanted to read may be one of the best ways for extroverts to seek tranquility."All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone," the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century."Let there be spaces in your togetherness," philosophical writer Kahlil Gibran advised in his book "The Prophet."Encouraging others in social distancing, Dizon had shared Gibran's popular adage with his social media followers. It's long been a popular reading at weddings, a meditation on how to carve out productive solitude within marriages.Now extroverts might consider Gibran's fuller text in their quest to maintain sanity in the age of coronavirus:"Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music."Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."                        If you're an extrovert and the thought of weeks or months of social distancing has you jumping out of your skin, rest assured. Your feelings are normal. And we're here to help.                              Advertisement                       "We are social beings," Jaime Blandino, a clinical psychologist in Decatur, Georgia, told CNN. "My most extroverted clients are having the hardest time." An extrovert is someone who gets his or her energy from other people. When they can't spend time with others, "they might not know what to do with themselves," she said. Blandino's practice has closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and she and her colleagues have moved to seeing all their clients through telehealth. Her message to her clients is simple: "It's normal to feel abnormal in a situation that's not normal." "I didn't know anybody who didn't feel a surge of anxiety when these new rules were introduced," she said. As the U.S. government prepares for a potential monthslong fight against COVID-19, extroverts will need to learn to create their own plans on how they might manage their own psyche as social distancing, quarantines and shelter in place orders become more commonplace. And if you're an introvert, quietly excited about the prospect of more alone time, there's a separate guide below on how you can make the most of social distancing.                                                                                                             The introvert's guide to social distancing                          Use technology to connect with friends Your "usual habits are going to be disrupted," said Gretchen Rubin, the author of "Outer Order, Inner Calm" and host of the "Happier" podcast. An important strategy is to "reimagine what you want and get out in front of it." In terms of social connection, "nothing can beat real life," she said, but the second best way to interact can be through images. There are plenty of apps offering video chat or live broadcast functions, ranging from Skype to House Party. You could use one to connect with a friend you haven't seen in awhile. She recommended "lots of touches" — virtually, of course — including writing physical cards to your friends, hosting a virtual family reunion and even basic lifestyle hacks like sending more voice memos rather than text messages. "People have more time and they want to hear your voice," she said. Or you can create more group text message threads with friends and family, knowing that at any given moment, somebody on the thread might be free and able to write back. In Italy, where the whole country has been in lockdown for more than a week ,  throngs joined in a singing flash mob belting out the country's national anthem from their apartment balconies.                                                                                                                                     Confined to their homes during outbreak, Italian neighbors sing from windows to boost morale                          No judgment if you want to round up your neighbors — through virtual means, please — and try the same. "We could come out of this closer," Rubin said. "We're all going through something big together." Socially, we're living in a backward time Blandino, the therapist, said that mental health professionals have traditionally advocated for in-person social experiences as antidotes to anxiety and depression, prizing real connections over virtual ones. That's now changing. "Some of the things that we'll recommend now go against what we used to advise," she said. "We're in a backward time." And while her introverted clients may be feeling less stressed, and sometimes even emboldened by social distancing, Blandino said both extroverts and introverts can leverage technology to weather the storm. Another option to feel connected is to host watch parties and virtual movie nights, watching the same movie from different locations using Netflix.                                                                                                                           Social distancing doesn't have to doom your weekends. Here are some ideas                          She even said you might consider keeping the TV on in the background with a familiar film or show from your childhood. "Hearing human voices is soothing," she said. It's a time to shine for any technology offering a way to connect with others. The Bumble dating app is seeing a spike in how people are using the app to meet dates. a company spokesman said. That uptick includes a 21% uptick in video call usage, along with a separate 21% increase in what the company calls "quality chats" — in which two people have a more substantive back-and-forth.                     Practice physical distancing, not social distancing Even with social distancing, it's still important to to go for walks, take a bike ride or hang out near your neighbors, said Dr. Don Dizon, a professor of medicine at Brown University. Even if you're in an area that now must shelter-in-place, it's still fine to go out for a walk and feel the sun on your skin as long as you're keeping proper distance from others.                                                                                                                 Here's how to safely exercise outside during the coronavirus outbreak                          "There is no national lockdown," he said. "It doesn't say that you can't go outside." And, he advised picking apart the concept of social distancing to make it feel less scary. As physician and researcher Dr. William Dale  has said , policies to contain COVID-19 are actually "physical distancing." There's still plenty of room to practice emotional and social connection, despite being physically separate. Dizon said he was finding time for online gaming. And he's been using Twitter, Instagram and TikTok to stay up to date with medical colleagues around the globe, sharing both funny videos and substantive scientific data. Find some time to read To help relax, now might be a good time to start up a book club on Facebook, Dizon added. From Plato to Thoreau, generations of philosophers, poets and prophets have celebrated solitude, stillness and taking time to get to know thyself. "Extroverts are very plugged in," Blandino said. "This is a time to practice slowing down and introducing new routines." There's no shortage of literature on that topic and taking a moment to sit quietly with a book you've always wanted to read may be one of the best ways for extroverts to seek tranquility. "All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone," the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century. "Let there be spaces in your togetherness," philosophical writer Kahlil Gibran advised in his book "The Prophet."                                                                                                                           'Frozen' star reads stories on Twitter for kids during coronavirus isolation                          Encouraging others in social distancing, Dizon had shared Gibran's popular adage with his social media followers.

Here's why health officials don't want everyone to get tested for coronavirus

If you want to get a test for the novel coronavirus, you're in good company.

If you want to get a test for the novel coronavirus, you're in good company."One of my sisters called me yesterday , 'I have to have my daughter tested for coronavirus,'" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press briefing Wednesday.The governor's niece had a fever and flu-like symptoms. Yet he told his sister "there's no reason for a test" since her daughter hadn't traveled to a coronavirus hot spot or been in contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus.Across the United States, physicians are sending the same message: Not everyone who wants a test will get a test."If we had all the resources in the world and could wave a magic wand, we would be happy to test these people, but they're not there, so I'm afraid we're having to prioritize," said  Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.New York City and Los Angeles County have laid out guidelines for testing, recommending that doctors avoid testing patients except in cases where a test result would significantly change the course of treatment.Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, explained to CNN who should and shouldn't get tested, given that there are not enough tests to go around.Their thoughts essentially echo what was done in New York City and Los Angeles: At a time when there aren't enough tests to meet demand, they should be given to patients when the result would make a difference in their care.First, a few notes. There will, of course, be exceptions to these categories, and different doctors and hospitals will have different rules. In addition, this rubric is a snapshot in time; as more tests become available, doctors can be more liberal about who they test.The CDC has some testing guidelines but notes that "decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians."Some states, such as New York and Washington, have more specific recommendations about who should be tested.Also note that there's no clear definition of what it means to be "elderly." The rubric below says 70 and older, but different doctors and hospitals will have different definitions. At Mass General, for example, for the purpose of coronavirus testing, they consider someone to be elderly if they're over 70, but depending on someone's health status, a patient could also be considered elderly if they're in their 60s.Finally, testing protocols for health care workers are different, since they can spread the virus to their patients and colleagues.Who doesn't need testingIf you don't have symptoms of the coronavirus: According to the CDC, symptoms of the virus include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. If you aren't experiencing them, you should not receive a test right now.That's true even if you've recently traveled to a coronavirus hot spot, such as China or Italy. It's true even if you've been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with coronavirus.The doctors noted that it's certainly possible you could have coronavirus even if you don't have symptoms, but that there just aren't enough tests right now to go around.If you have symptoms, you're healthy and under age 70: The doctors said even if you have symptoms, you should not receive a test right now because of the shortage."The test isn't going to change what we do for you," said Walensky, a professor at Harvard Medical School."A lot of the reason we test for the flu is we have something to give you if you test positive," she added, referring to antivirals that can lessen the duration and severity of flu symptoms. "But this isn't like the flu. We don't have anything specific to give you for coronavirus."The doctors said their advice to young healthy people with a fever and cough would be the same no matter what's causing it: Go home; rest; get plenty of fluids; stay away from other people; and get medical attention if you develop shortness of breath.That last bit of advice about seeking medical attention would be true whether you have coronavirus, the flu, or any other respiratory ailment, they said."If you're in this group, you're not in trouble. Whether you have flu or COVID-19 or some other respiratory virus, we anticipate you will do well," said Schaffner, using the medical term for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. "But should you develop any symptoms that show you're getting worse, particularly if you have any difficulty breathing, you will call us."After you recover, you should continue keeping away from other people as much as possible, whether your illness was due to coronavirus or something else."Everyone should be social distancing," Walensky said. "Where in God's name are you going?" Who might need testingIf you're over age 70 or have an underlying severe medical condition and you have mild to moderate symptoms of coronavirus: If you're in this group, doctors would do an evaluation to determine what tests you might need, including whether you need a coronavirus test."We would want to see you. You're a little more fragile to begin with, so not just because of COVID, we would want to make sure you're OK," Walensky said.Who does needs testingAnyone who has symptoms and has been in close contact with someone who has had a positive coronavirus test: The CDC defines close contact as having direct contact with the infectious secretions of someone who has coronavirus, such as being coughed on, or being within about 6 feet of an infected person "for a prolonged period of time."Anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus and needs to be hospitalized: If you have symptoms of coronavirus and you need to be hospitalized for any reason, doctors will want to test you. If you do have the virus, for infection control reasons, it will influence where you get placed in the hospital, and doctors will take special precautions to protect themselves when caring for you.As more tests become available, Schaffner and Walensky say they hope to be able to loosen up these categories and test more patients.But it's not just a matter of test availability.Swabs and other supplies needed to perform the test are also in short supply. Also, doctors and nurses have to put on personal protection equipment to perform a coronavirus test, such as gloves and special masks. Since that equipment is in short supply, doctors want to conserve it for those who most need testing.Finally, if everyone got a test, it would overload the system."We have to do the test, and then somebody has to process it and get it to the lab. And then somebody has to call the patients back and tell them the results. I can't see having health care facilities having that kind of manpower," Walensky said. "Maybe we'll get there, and that would be great."                        If you want to get a test for the novel coronavirus, you're in good company.

Iowa bar changing business strategy to 'Booze Cruise'
.W
With many customers stuck at home in self-quarantine, this bar owner came up with an idea to bring the bar to them – a booze cruise.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced restaurants and bars to get creative or face the reality of closing their doors for the foreseeable future.Barley’s Bar and Grill in downtown Council Bluffs, Iowa, decided on the former, choosing to bring happy hour to customers’ homes.Matt Johnson is the owner of Barley’s, a local establishment that is normally full of loyal customers. With many of those customers stuck at home in quarantine, Johnson came up with an idea to bring the bar to them – a booze cruise.“It’s a novelty,” said Johnson. “I think the whole ice cream truck concept with beer has been well taken.”An ice cream truck for adults, but with all of their favorites – beer, wine, seltzers, liquor and even homemade Bloody Mary kits.“We have had to change our entire business model the last week with everything going on,” said Johnson.Johnson, along with another member of his staff, take orders via email and deliver them directly to the customer’s doorstep. They’ve only been doing deliveries since Thursday, but it’s already become quite the commodity. “The community’s been unreal,” he said. “Almost everybody we’ve went to is a regular customer at Barley’s.”Johnson isn’t sure how long they’ll keep doing this drink delivery service, but he’s enjoying it so far and will continue to deliver the necessary supplies for his customers’ quarantine cocktails.

'Disaster prepper' offers advice on coronavirus outbreak

This disaster readiness consultant says he has seen a spike in calls and emails about COVID-19, the coronavirus, and its impact.

The term disaster or survival "prepper" may conjure images of bunkers or rations, but Jim Cobb says it is much more practical than you might think."(As) I look at it, it's common sense," Cobb said.Cobb is a disaster readiness consultant and the editor-in-chief of Prepper Survival Guide magazine. He said he has seen a spike in calls and emails about COVID-19, the coronavirus, and its impact. "I have people asking me what to do," Cobb said. "'What should I stock up on? What should I buy at the store?' I also have people asking me, 'How bad do you think it's going to get?'"Cobb's biggest piece of advice is to have at least a few weeks' worth of food on hand that will last."We're not talking about buying a pallet's worth of canned beets or a ton of rice. Just buy a little bit extra of what you normally eat," Cobb said.Cobb also cautions against special "survival food," which he said can be expensive and is not healthy in the long-term, he said.

Governor announces redevelopment plans for Baltimore's State Center
.W
Thousands of Maryland state employees will move from State Center to offices in downtown Baltimore to make way for a redevelopment project, the governor announced.

Thousands of Maryland state employees will move from State Center to offices in downtown Baltimore to make way for a redevelopment project, the governor announced.Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday the latest developments in the State Center redevelopment project meant to replace the state office complex in Baltimore.Along with new office spaces, the project would also bring a new grocery store and new affordable housing to the area, the governor said.The governor originally pulled the plug on the project in 2016 because he said the previous deal was not financially possible or legally proper.Now, he believes the state is ready to handle the project. He announced Tuesday that crews will tear down State Center, despite an ongoing lawsuit by prior developers, and private investors will redevelop the site."The plan is to move the 12 agencies and the 3,300 employees to areas in and around the Central Business District, which will absorb and occupy more than 1 million square feet of office space, and which will be a dramatic boost to help stabilize downtown Baltimore," Hogan said.The employees who work at State Center will be relocated in phases, the governor said.The governor said there is no plan for the state to return to State Center as an anchor. The project is currently in the planning phase, and there's no timeline for completion."Effective immediately, we will move forward with the next two steps by initiating the RFI, the request for information, and RFP, request for proposal, to expedite an agreement in order to achieve a bold, transformative  redevelopment of the State Center project," Hogan said.The Hogan administration is in a court battle with developer State Center LLC, which had prior rights to the 28-acre site. The case is being heard in Baltimore City Circuit Court.State Center LLC released a statement, saying, "Today, the governor announced the hollowing out of State Center.  By transferring every government agency out of State Center forever, he has broken the State's decades-long commitment to the surrounding communities and to the city not to do so."It is no coincidence that today's surprise announcement comes days after the court ordered some transparency into what this governor was up to in cancelling the State Center Project.  Citing allegations of 'government misconduct,' the court observed how the governor 'abruptly reversed course' on its 'long-term partners.' The midtown Baltimore community must feel the same way today, as it forever loses the government employees anchoring State Center.  The governor is long on details for cleaning out State Center, but short on any description of the future."Watch the governor's press conference:             BALTIMORE

"Mrs. Trump got tested the same night as the president was tested, out of an abundance of caution. The test was negative," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

First lady Melania Trump tested negative for coronavirus, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN Monday."Mrs. Trump got tested the same night as the president was tested, out of an abundance of caution. The test was negative," Grisham said.President Donald Trump first announced that the first lady had received a test during his remarks at a Monday evening White House coronavirus task force briefing with reporters. Asked by a reporter whether his wife had been tested, Trump said, "Yes," and added that the first lady was "fine."

As grocery store shelves sit bare during the coronavirus pandemic, good Samaritans across the country are taking it upon themselves to turn "Little Free Libraries" into "Little Free Pantries."

13,000 stranded Americans struggle to find way home as coronavirus outbreak surges
.W
State Department officials said they are organizing 16 flights in the next few days, deploying an emergency fund to charter flights and discussing the use of Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security planes to transport stranded Americans.

As the State Department arranges flights to bring back Americans stuck abroad by border closures and flight cancellations due to the coronavirus outbreak, many of those citizens and their families tell CNN they are still struggling to get clear answers from the agency tasked with protecting their health and well-being overseas.State Department officials told reporters Monday they are organizing 16 flights in the next few days, deploying an emergency fund to charter flights and discussing the use of Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security planes to transport stranded Americans, some 13,500 of whom have reached out for help getting home and are now being tracked by the department."No option is foreclosed out," a senior State Department official said.The officials spoke a day after President Donald Trump said the government is "working very hard, long," to help Americans overseas. Vice President Mike Pence added that, "We've been working very diligently through the State Department to make it possible. Their commercial flights have been chartered and we're also working with the military for a backup on flights."'Unprecedented challenges'On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that "Americans abroad face unprecedented challenges" and that his department "will continue to assist them wherever they're located."But travelers overseas and their worried families back at home say they are scrambling for information and help, telling CNN that their most frequent and reliable sources of support aren't coming from the State Department or U.S. government, but from groups on the social media messaging service WhatsApp, their lawmakers and foreign officials in the countries where they are stuck.Wil Franklin, manager at Trinity River Vineyard in Humboldt Country, California, has been trying to get information to help his half-brother and father get out of Peru, getting assistance eventually from Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman's office, which reached out about a chartered flight. Franklin said his family, hunkered down in Arequipa, Peru, haven't gotten clear information from the State Department."They're in the dark," he said. "We've been communicating to them what's going on" regarding the conversations with Huffman.One U.S. graduate student in Honduras for vacation said she has also struggled to get clear communication from the State Department. Honduras closed its borders the day after the 26-year-old arrived for a scuba diving trip in the Bay Islands and she's been trying to get out ever since. The State Department travel warning she checked the day before they left March 13 mentioned no risk of coronavirus or transportation shutdowns, just the risk of violence."I wish that the communication was better because I don't know how much they are doing," this woman said of the State Department's efforts to help Americans. "They might be doing a lot. We heard Trump say yesterday that they're doing a lot to help Americans who are stuck. We aren't seeing any of that."Referring to the high-profile extraction of an American women's football team, who were taken out of Honduras on U.S. military planes, the woman said, "We're just seeing the American football team being evacuated and that's frustrating. For all I know, they're paying United a bunch of money to come down here."In contrast, the offices of both New Jersey's Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Robert Menendez, have reached out to her mother to offer help.Like the other Americans CNN spoke to, she had enrolled in the Safe Traveler Enrollment Program, or STEP, but her attempts to reach the U.S. embassy or consulate have been frustrating. After sending an email to the consulate to ask if she could trust outreach by the local Honduran governor of the Bay Islands, she received an email that didn't respond to the question but told her to keep trying commercial flights.Like many other Americans stuck overseas, this student has turned to a WhatsApp group. Her other reliable source of information is the Bay Islands governor, Dino Silvestri, who is holding daily webcast briefings to answer questions from stranded foreigners and convey information about airlines and flights.'It was worth it'"He's where all of our information is coming from; a lot of people are frustrated that we're hearing from him and not our government," the student said. She learned of a United flight with spare seats through Silvestri's chats and the WhatsApp group and is hoping to get on it Tuesday. Those with money have taken action on their own.Fred Warkentine arranged his own six-person charter for his family to get them from Roatan, Honduras, to Miami on Sunday night. They were flying from Miami to Louisville on Monday.He told CNN it cost "$15,000 ... which was a huge sum ... but when your airline has abandoned you and we were concerned the U.S. was going to close their borders ... and factoring cost to stay in Roatan, the changing uncertainty of things in Roatan and lost income ... we felt it was worth it."Warkentine estimated that there were at least 800 U.S. citizens still stuck on the Bay Islands. He said a large charter left late Sunday night. Dale Buckner, the CEO of Global Guardian -- the private security firm that arranged the charter -- said it transported 144 Americans at the cost of $1,300 per seat. Buckner estimates that his firm has repatriated roughly 2,000 people to the U.S., and will bring back "approximately 600 to 800 more Americans in the next 24 to 30 hours," if all goes according to plan.Asked by CNN what message they want to send frightened Americans overseas trying to get home, State officials essentially say "get out while you can" -- a foregone option for many stuck in countries where borders suddenly closed and flights were canceled."If you are a U.S. citizen, and you are abroad at the moment, take a look at your circumstances, determine whether this is a place where you'd be willing to hunker down for an indeterminate period of time, as airspace and borders etc. close down," the senior official said. "If you are somewhere where you think, 'No this is not where I would want to be over the long haul,' take advantage of existing commercial opportunities and get out now."The official said they were "hesitant to give a guarantee" that they would be able to move every single person, noting "we're hearing about people who are in very remote locations in very remote parts of the world.""It's complicated," they said. "We are moving very large numbers of people and we will continue this effort."As part of the repatriation effort, the department created a task force last week, but the official was unable to say how many staff are assigned to it, telling reporters that consular officers all over the world are working to help American citizens. The official was also unable to describe the geographic spread of countries that Americans are seeking help to leave or how many have enrolled in the STEP program.The State Department officials said the agency's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs is working with private charters to get them into places to help with repatriation efforts, using a fund specially authorized by Congress for emergencies that's known as the K Fund.Government aircraft"We're looking at 16 or so flights in the next five days. And we've got additionally about 1,600 passengers, over 1,600 passengers identified for those flights with room for more," the senior official said.They said that in addition to the K Fund charters, they are using Defense Department backhaul, or returning, flights in some cases."We're also working with the Department of Homeland Security. They're flying planes into Central America, and they are prepared to bring folks back on those aircraft. So it's a variety of different U.S. government aircraft," the senior official said.Space on these flights will be prioritized for those with vulnerabilities including age and medical conditions. "If we have somebody who is 70 years old with an underlying condition such as diabetes or heart disease, that person is going to get a higher priority on one of those flights, than the hale and hearty 20-year-old," they said.That official said about 5,700 people had been brought back, and "the great majority of those were coming back through State Department chartered aircraft," including more than 800 from Wuhan, China, in late January, more than 300 from Yokohama, Japan and "approximately 1,200 came out of Morocco last week."On Monday afternoon, the U.S. embassy in Guatemala announced a second charter flight had left the country. "We plan two more flights tomorrow, and two on Wednesday," they said in a tweet.Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Peru said that to date, approximately 600 Americans have departed Peru on charter flights."Be advised that the government of Peru is limiting air traffic to repatriation travel for U.S. citizens facilitated through the U.S. government. Beware of scams. Up-to-date and credible information can be found on the U.S. Embassy's official platforms," they said in an advisory Monday.The first charter flight to leave Guatemala for the U.S. left earlier Monday. "We are committed to helping Americans return home during #COVIDー19," the embassy wrote in a tweet along with a video of the plane taking off.

Loss of smell, taste might signal coronavirus infection
.W
The U.N. health agency is looking into the question of whether the loss of smell or taste are a defining feature of the disease.

A loss of smell or taste might be an early sign of infection with the pandemic virus, say medical experts who cite reports from several countries.It might even serve as a useful screening tool, they say.The idea of a virus infection reducing sense of smell is not new. Respiratory viral infection is a common cause of loss of smell, because inflammation can interfere with airflow and the ability to detect odors. The sense of smell usually returns when the infection resolves, but in a small percentage of cases, smell loss can persist after other symptoms disappear. In some cases, it is permanent.Now, there's “good evidence” from South Korea, China and Italy for loss or impairment of smell in infected people, says a joint statement from the presidents of the British Rhinological Society and of ENT UK, a British group that represents ear, nose and throat doctors. In South Korea, some 30% of people who tested positive for the virus have cited loss of smell as their major complaint in otherwise mild cases, they wrote.So that might be useful as a way to spot infected people without other symptoms — fever, coughing and shortness of breath — of the new coronavirus, they wrote.A similar proposal was published Sunday by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. It noted “rapidly accumulating” anecdotal evidence from around the world that the pandemic virus can cause not only loss of smell but also a diminished sense of taste. So the appearance of those symptoms in people without another explanation should alert doctors to the possibility of a COVID-19 infection, the group said.Maria Van Kerkhove, an outbreak expert at the World Health Organization, told reporters Monday that the U.N. health agency is looking into the question of whether the loss of smell or taste are a defining feature of the disease.Dr. Eric Holbrook, an expert on nasal and sinus disease at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital in Boston, said the reports have been a hot topic among researchers and doctors. But “we don't have hard evidence right now” about how often smell loss occurs in people infected with the pandemic virus, he said in an interview Monday.Holbrook said the reports he has seen suggest the sense of smell returns within a couple weeks, but how long it lasts has yet to be firmly established.He also said it's difficult to assess reports of a loss of taste because people with an impaired sense of smell often report a loss of flavor, which is technically different from an impairment in taste.Holbrook said he is trying to set up a study of smell in people being tested for the coronavirus at Boston-area hospitals.

Fearing coronavirus, Arizona man dies after taking a form of chloroquine used to treat aquariums

A man is dead and his wife is under critical care after the two took chloroquine phosphate in an apparent attempt to self-medicate for the novel coronavirus.

A Phoenix-area man is dead and his wife is under critical care after the two took chloroquine phosphate in an apparent attempt to self-medicate for the novel coronavirus, according to hospital system Banner Health.It does not appear they took the pharmaceutical version of the drug, but rather "an additive commonly used at aquariums to clean fish tanks," Banner Health said in a statement.Though Banner did not provide additional details, NBC News spoke to the wife, who said they learned of chloroquine's connection to coronavirus during a President Donald Trump news conference, which "was on a lot actually.""I had (the substance) in the house because I used to have koi fish," she told the network.Trump has touted chloroquine as a possible treatment for COVID-19. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but the FDA has not approved it to treat the coronavirus.Banner Health experts emphasized that the medication — as well as other "inappropriate medications and household products" — "should not be ingested to treat or prevent this virus.""Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus," Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center, said in the statement. "But self-medicating is not the way to do so."Seven years ago, the publication, Advanced Aquarist, heralded three forms of chloroquine as "a 'new' drug for treating fish diseases" and detailed its effectiveness in fighting off certain parasites in saltwater aquariums.One online aquarium retailer, which was sold out of "the wonder drug" Tuesday, included in its terms of use that customers agree to use chloroquine "ONLY in the treatment and maintenance of ornamental fish. ... We agree not to intentionally divert these chemicals for any other use."Banner Health, which is based in Arizona, didn't give any details on how the couple, both in their 60s, acquired the chloroquine or which Banner hospital treated them."Within thirty minutes of ingestion, the couple experienced immediate effects requiring admittance to a nearby Banner Health hospital," its statement said.Trump has called chloroquine and the closely related hydroxychloroquine potentially important in the fight against COVID-19."HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine," he tweeted Saturday.Early research suggests the drug could be useful against the virus, but Trump's comments have prompted health officials to warn that further study is needed.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said the drugs may be effective against the novel coronavirus. However, he told CBS on Sunday that Trump had heard about the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination's effectiveness from anecdotal reports."I'm not disagreeing with the fact anecdotally they might work, but my job is to prove definitively from a scientific standpoint that they do work," said Fauci, who serves on the White House coronavirus task force. In Nigeria, health officials issued a warning about chloroquine, saying three people in the country have overdosed on the drug after Trump endorsed it as a potential treatment.Banner Health said it is "strongly urging" health care providers not to prescribe chloroquine to patients who aren't hospitalized."The last thing that we want right now is to inundate our emergency departments with patients who believe they found a vague and risky solution that could potentially jeopardize their health," Brooks said.

At a time when countless universities have sent students home, one university is reopening its doors.

At a time when countless universities have sent students home, one university is reopening its doors.About 1,900 students returned to Liberty University, a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia, a spokesman confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and other leaders discussed whether to extend spring break and "risk students having a longer time to become exposed to the virus," the school said in a statement. It decided it was safer to bring the students back to campus."During Spring Break, Falwell and his executive leadership team began meeting every afternoon to determine the measures that needed to be taken for all programs to go online and for students to be able to return to their dorms and use the campus dining services that they paid for," the statement said.Falwell's decision to bring students back to campus flies against the guidance provided by state officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Related video: Harvard University president tests positive for coronavirusGov. Ralph Northam issued a statewide order Monday to help slow the spread of coronavirus. The order bans gatherings of more than 10 people and goes into effect just before midnight on Tuesday.The order also closes nonessential businesses and shuts down all K-12 schools for the rest of the academic year.Northam expressed concern after learning the university was allowing students back on campus."The governor is concerned by these reports, and members of the administration have already spoken directly with Jerry Falwell Jr.," said press secretary Alena Yarmosky. "All Virginia colleges and universities have a responsibility to comply with public health directions and protect the safety of their students, faculty and larger communities. Liberty University is no exception."Lynchburg Mayor Treney Tweedy said she did not endorse having the students return to campus."I was very surprised and disappointed to later learn of President Falwell's most recent decision to allow students back on campus," she said in a statement. "We are in the midst of a public health crisis. I am concerned for the students, faculty and employees at Liberty University, and I am also very concerned for the residents of the Lynchburg community."The university gave students a choice in whether they wanted to return by filling out an online form with their intent. As of Tuesday afternoon, about 1,900 students have returned to campus out of the student population of 14,000 to 15,000, university spokesman Scott Lamb said.University officials are prepared for about 5,000 students to return to campus, Lamb added."Our thinking was, 'Let's get them back as soon as we can -- the ones who want to come back," Falwell said in the statement.The university said that it was "in compliance of all state restrictions related to COVID-19" following a Virginia Department of Health inspection during its spring break after the state's 10-person limit on restaurants went into effect. However, it was unclear if that is still accurate following students' return.CNN reached out to the Department of Health but did not immediately receive a comment.Now that spring break is over, the university moved all instruction online Monday, according to a statement.Students have the option to remain at home or return to campus to take classes online, the university said.

As of Tuesday afternoon, about 1,900 students have returned to campus out of the student population of 14,000 to 15,000, university spokesman Scott Lamb said. University officials are prepared for about 5,000 students to return to campus, Lamb added. "Our thinking was, 'Let's get them back as soon as we can -- the ones who want to come back," Falwell said in the statement. The university said that it was "in compliance of all state restrictions related to COVID-19" following a Virginia Department of Health inspection during its spring break after the state's 10-person limit on restaurants went into effect. However, it was unclear if that is still accurate following students' return. CNN reached out to the Department of Health but did not immediately receive a comment. Now that spring break is over, the university moved all instruction online Monday, according to a  statement . Students have the option to remain at home or return to campus to take classes online, the university said.

Some people just won't stay home during a pandemic. Here are some reasons that may explain why

Despite repeated pleas from public health and government officials to stay home and slow the spread of COVID-19, many people just won't. Why don't some people take the threat seriously?

Living through a pandemic is strange. Most of us have never been asked to make sacrifices like this before — staying home and limiting contact with others.All that disruption can make people anxious.

Doctors produce 3D view of the inside of COVID-19 patient's lungs

A doctor has created a virtual rendering of what the inside of a coronavirus patient's lung looks like; he believes it will send a powerful message to the public.

A doctor has created a virtual rendering of what the inside of a lung of a patient with the coronavirus looks like, he believes it will send a powerful message to the public. It is a first of its kind view inside the lungs of a patient with COVID-19. The patient is a man in his late 50s who initially had a fever and a non-productive cough according to Dr. Keith Mortman. Mortman is chief of thoracic surgery at George Washington University Hospital.  “The respiratory symptoms progressed quite rapidly, to the point where he had to be intubated and put on the ventilator,” said Mortman.A 360° rendering showed what the virus does to the human body.“What you’re seeing in the video, essentially the blue part is the more normal lung, but anything you’re seeing that’s yellow is lung that’s being destroyed by the virus,” Mortman said. The rendering was created in partnership with a company called Surgical Theater that used a patients CAT scan to create an interactive model.“It’s quite alarming to see, in all honesty. Because unlike your garden variety pneumonia that might affect only one small part of the lung, or unlike the common flu, what you’re seeing in this video is really the widespread diffuse damage to the lung,” Mortman said.Mortman’s hope is that the technology can help medical professionals on the front lines, but he also wants members of the public to see the images for themselves.“It’s really to educate them,” Mortman said. “I really want them to see this and understand the damage that’s being done to the lungs, the severity of the disease that this is causing. Perhaps, maybe they think twice before having a house-party or going outside with large groups.”                        A doctor has created a virtual rendering of what the inside of a lung of a patient with the coronavirus looks like, he believes it will send a powerful message to the public.

Sailors test positive for coronavirus at sea as US military leaders say crisis could last into summer

"Three cases of COVID-19 have been identified among personnel currently deployed and underway on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. These are our first three cases of COVID-19 on a ship that is deployed," said acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly.

The Pentagon's senior leadership broadcast a different message than President Donald Trump on Tuesday, with military leaders warning the coronavirus crisis could last well into the summer as the president seeks to open the economy back up.The severity of the challenge was underlined with the news that three U.S. sailors tested positive for the virus while at sea."You're looking at somewhere around 90 days, based on some of the other countries. That may or may not apply to the United States," said Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when asked how long the crisis could last during an online town hall. Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper took questions from service members during the town hall."If it does apply, you're looking at probably late May, June, something in that range. Maybe could be as late as July."Milley was clear that "no one actually knows" when the crisis will be over, but that they were looking at "a variety of models."On the same day that the president said at a Fox News town hall that he wants the country "opened up and just raring to go by Easter," Esper made it clear the Pentagon was preparing for a longer period of social distancing."I think we need to plan for this to be a few months long, at least, and we're taking all precautionary measures to do that," he said.Esper said that Pentagon employees would be teleworking for "weeks, for sure," and "maybe months," after announcing Monday that the Pentagon was increasing the number of staff that would be teleworking, and limiting the number of access points into the building.He further warned that the Defense Department, despite stockpiling medical supplies, would likely face shortages of personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, as the civilian health care system is currently dealing with, "until the private sector industry can pick up the slack."Sailors flown for treatmentLater Tuesday, the Pentagon announced three sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and have been flown to a military medical facility for treatment."Three cases of COVID-19 have been identified among personnel currently deployed and underway on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. These are our first three cases of COVID-19 on a ship that is deployed," said acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly."We've identified all those folks that they've had contact with and we are quantifying they as well," he added.They are the first reported cases of the virus aboard a U.S. Navy ship while it was at sea.The carrier was last in port 15 days ago as part of a visit to Vietnam. However, Navy officials would not say if the sailors were exposed to the coronavirus while there, noting that multiple aircraft had flown to the carrier in the intervening period.There are approximately 5,000 personnel on board the carrier.Esper had previously announced Monday that the Pentagon is looking at sending military field hospitals to New York and Washington State, in addition to the Army Corps of Engineers' undertaking to retrofit buildings in New York, including hotels, dormitories and convention centers into temporary hospitals, in order to add an additional 10,000 hospital beds to the state's capacity.However, he warned that although multiple states have requested assistance from the Defense Department, they "can't meet everyone's needs.""Right now, I anticipate sending a hospital to Seattle and a hospital to New York City and beyond that, once that's confirmed, we will look at sending to other places, and as necessary we will continue to alert units to prepare to deploy and deploy them as appropriate," Esper said Monday.The Pentagon has already ordered the deployment of the Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy to Los Angeles to help alleviate the some of the burden on civilian hospitals, while the USNS Comfort is expected to deploy to New York in the coming weeks, after it is finished undergoing maintenance.And as countries all over the world grapple with the pandemic, Milley warned Tuesday that the crisis could lead to "social breakdowns" or "political chaos in certain countries" as health care systems are overwhelmed. However, he assessed that the virus would likely have a "moderate to low" impact on U.S. military readiness."It's very, very important, again, that we do what the professionals are telling us to do, which is flatten that curve, take all the appropriate measures for U.S. in the military," Milley said, "but also in the nation to do our part, so to speak, in order to reduce the probability and to mitigate the impact of this coronavirus globally."

Is it safe to send your kids to day care during the coronavirus outbreak?
.W
Stuck wondering whether to send your children to day care during the coronavirus outbreak? Here are the facts.

With schools across the country closed, and playgrounds strongly discouraged, it can seem like a no-brainer not to send your kids to school. But for many parents, day care is a necessity if they are to be able to work during the day. This leaves many parents asking if day cares can be the exception to the rule. Mark Albert spoke with Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, infectious disease specialist of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, to better understand the risks of day care in the coronavirus age."What should day care facilities ?" Albert asked. "A lot of parents want to know: Should they be sending their kids still to day care? Should the day cares be closing? What's the limit on the number of kids in the day care?""Yeah, as a parent of two myself, I absolutely understand and commiserate with the situation," Dionne-Odom said. "It's very challenging when schools close and day cares are having hard decisions to come up with too. I think some of the data that we're starting to see is showing that it's possible for children to be infected with COVID-19 and have minimal to no symptoms. I think for that reason, the decision that a lot of states have made, including Alabama, to close schools was the right one. Though some day cares have continued to stay open, Dionne-Odom recommends against it."I know that some day cares have closed, some have not. I think that's a decision that can be informed by what the local epidemiology is and what the local public health officials are saying. But I do think that the safest place for those kids to be right now is not together in one room, but at home. I think it's important for all parents to also know with this risk of asymptomatic transmission from children, that even if your child is feeling fine, it is possible that they could transmit the virus to someone who is in that older age group or the risk category. So that's again, another call for social distancing and not having kids be outside and exposing people who are at risk."

I think for that reason, the decision that a lot of states have made, including Alabama, to close schools was the right one.                                                                                                             Can the coronavirus spread through mail? What about on your clothes?                          Though some day cares have continued to stay open, Dionne-Odom recommends against it. "I know that some day cares have closed, some have not. I think that's a decision that can be informed by what the local epidemiology is and what the local public health officials are saying. But I do think that the safest place for those kids to be right now is not together in one room, but at home. I think it's important for all parents to also know with this risk of asymptomatic transmission from children, that even if your child is feeling fine, it is possible that they could transmit the virus to someone who is in that older age group or the risk category. So that's again, another call for social distancing and not having kids be outside and exposing people who are at risk."

Cruise ship docked in New Jersey to set sail after family of 4 tests negative in coronavirus scare
.W
The ship was supposed to leave for a Caribbean voyage Saturday night, but was delayed after passengers aboard the ship when it returned Friday became ill.

A cruise ship in Bayonne, New Jersey, will finally set sail Monday after a coronavirus scare kept it docked — and its passengers waiting — for days.The Anthem of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, was supposed to leave for a Caribbean voyage Saturday night, but was delayed after passengers aboard the ship when it returned Friday became ill.The four passengers evaluated for coronavirus all tested negative and were discharged from the hospital, according to a statement from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.The ship will now reroute from the Bahamas to Bermuda. Royal Caribbean offered Anthem of the Seas guests half off of a future cruise.The World Health Organization and the United States have declared the outbreak of the virus with an epicenter in Hubei Province, China, a public health emergency.New Jersey has no confirmed cases of the virus, Murphy said, and risk to residents remain low.23 passengers clearedThe Anthem of the Seas returned from a trip to the Caribbean Friday and docked in Bayonne, New Jersey.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began assessing passengers after two members of a family of four became ill on the ship, a CDC official said.The family had a history of travel to mainland China, but not to Hubei Province.Twenty-three passengers on the returning voyage who recently traveled to China were evaluated and cleared at the port, but the four family members were sent to an area hospital and tested for novel coronavirus.They all tested negative, Murphy said. The CDC allowed the family to be discharged from the hospital.Thousands of passengers in quarantineTravelers aboard the Anthem of the Seas join thousands of other cruise ship passengers affected by attempts to contain the virus that now has more than 40,000 confirmed cases worldwide.More than 7,300 people are quarantined on two cruise ships docked in Hong Kong and Japan over concerns they were inadvertently exposed to the coronavirus by infected passengers.At least 135 people from all over the world have tested positive for coronavirus on the cruise ship docked in Japan.Two U.S.-based cruise lines are forbidding people with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from boarding because of the outbreak.

Young adults held coronavirus party to defy orders to socially distance. Now one of them has coronavirus

The party goers intentionally got together "thinking they were invincible" and purposely defied state guidance to practice social distancing, officials said.

At least one person in Kentucky is infected after taking part at a "coronavirus party" with a group of young adults, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday.The party goers intentionally got together "thinking they were invincible" and purposely defied state guidance to practice social distancing, Bashear said."This is one that makes me mad," the governor said. "We have to be much better than that."While COVID-19 has been more deadly and severe for people older than 60 and those with underlying health issues in data from China, health officials and leaders around the country have been imploring young people to practice social distancing, because even people who are infected but without symptoms can transmit it to other people.In fact, recent modeling based on Chinese data shows asymptomatic carriers of the virus may have been responsible for its initial rapid spread there.The virus seems to be affecting young people in the United States more than it has in China. A report released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed up to 20% of people hospitalized with coronavirus in the United States are between the ages of 20 and 44. In New York state, more than half of coronavirus cases -- 53% -- have been among young people between the ages of 18 and 49, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.California on Tuesday reported the first death in the United States of a COVID-19 patient younger than 18, and the family of a 12-year-old in Georgia said Sunday she was on a ventilator and fighting for her life in an Atlanta hospital.There also have been "concerning reports from France and Italy" about young people becoming seriously ill, "and very seriously ill in the ICUs," Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, said last week.

Can blood from coronavirus survivors treat the newly ill?
.W
Hospitals are gearing up to test if a century-old treatment used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, just might work for COVID-19, too: using blood donated from patients who’ve recovered.

Hospitals are gearing up to test if a century-old treatment used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, and tried more recently against SARS and Ebola, just might work for COVID-19, too: using blood donated from patients who’ve recovered.Doctors in China attempted the first COVID-19 treatments using what the history books call “convalescent serum” -- today, known as donated plasma -- from survivors of the new virus.Now, a network of U.S. hospitals is waiting on permission from the Food and Drug Administration to begin large studies of the infusions both as a possible treatment for the sick and as vaccine-like temporary protection for people at high risk of infection.There's no guarantee it will work.“We won’t know until we do it, but the historical evidence is encouraging,” Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health told The Associated Press.Casadevall drew on that history in filing the Food and Drug Administration application. The FDA is “working expeditiously to facilitate the development and availability of convalescent plasma" a spokesman said.Here are some questions and answers about this latest quest for a treatment.WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS POSSIBLE THERAPY?It may sound like “back to the Stone Age,” but there’s good scientific reason to try using survivors' blood, said Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who coauthored the FDA application with Casadevall and another colleague at the Mayo Clinic.When a person gets infected by a particular germ, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. After the person recovers, those antibodies float in survivors’ blood -- specifically plasma, the liquid part of blood — for months, even years.One of the planned studies would test if giving infusions of survivors' antibody-rich plasma to newly ill COVID-19 patients would boost their own body’s attempts to fight off the virus. To see if it works, researchers would measure if the treatment gave patients a better chance of living or reduced the need for breathing machines.One caution: While regular plasma transfusions are a mainstay of medicine, very rarely they can cause a lung-damaging side effect.COULD IT ALSO ACT LIKE A VACCINE?Sort of, but unlike a vaccine, any protection would only be temporary.A vaccine trains people’s immune systems to make their own antibodies against a target germ. The plasma infusion approach would give people a temporary shot of someone else’s antibodies that are short-lived and require repeated doses.Still, if FDA agrees, a second study would give antibody-rich plasma infusions to certain people at high risk from repeated exposures to COVID-19, such as hospital workers or first responders, said Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski of New York's Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. That also might include nursing homes when a resident becomes ill, in hopes of giving the other people in the home some protection, she said.“We need both things desperately,” Pirofski said. “We need to be able to break the cycle of transmission and we also need to be able to help people who are ill.”WHAT’S THE HISTORY?These plasma infusions were used most famously during the 1918 flu pandemic, and against numerous other infections, such as measles and bacterial pneumonia, before vaccines and modern medicines came along. In the Journal of Clinical Investigation earlier this month, Casadevall and Pirofski cited evidence that 1918 flu patients given the infusions were less likely to die. And a 1935 medical report detailed how doctors stopped a measles outbreak from sweeping through a boarding school using “serum” from prior patients.The old-fashioned approach still is dusted off every so often to tackle surprise outbreaks such as SARS in 2002, and in 2014 when Ebola survivors’ plasma was used to treat other patients during the West Africa epidemic. Even during those recent outbreaks, strict studies of the technique were not done, but Casadevall said there were clues that the plasma helped.Casadevall thinks that when it didn't work, it may have been used too late. "Somebody at the end of their life, it’s very hard to affect” any disease at that point, he cautioned.A more modern approach is to brew this type of antibody in the lab, something Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and other companies are working on. Using blood from COVID-19 survivors is a decidedly more labor-intensive approach — but researchers could start banking the plasma as soon as regulators give the OK.HOW WOULD DOCTORS GET THE PLASMA?Blood banks take plasma donations much like they take donations of whole blood; regular plasma is used in hospitals and emergency rooms every day. If someone’s donating only plasma, their blood is drawn through a tube, the plasma is separated and the rest infused back into the donor’s body. Then that plasma is tested and purified to be sure it doesn't harbor any blood-borne viruses and is safe to use.For COVID-19 research, the difference would be who does the donating -- people who have recovered from the coronavirus. Scientists would measure how many antibodies are in a unit of donated plasma — tests just now being developed that aren't available to the general public — as they figure out what's a good dose, and how often a survivor could donate.Researchers aren’t worried about finding volunteer donors but caution it will take some time to build up a stock.“I get multiple emails a day from people, saying, ‘Can I help, can I give my plasma?’” Pirofski said.

Michael Jackson estate giving $300K to Broadway workers and Las Vegas needy impacted by coronavirus

The donation will help entertainment industry workers on Broadway, the music business and in Las Vegas who have been impacted by the coronavirus.

The Michael Jackson estate is donating $300,000 to help entertainment industry workers on Broadway, the music business and in Las Vegas who have been impacted by the coronavirus.The estate announced Wednesday that it will give $100,000 apiece to Broadway Cares, the food bank Three Square in Nevada and MusiCares, because all three areas have been good to the estate and to Jackson. "This virus, this pandemic affects all of us obviously, so we wanted to start in our own communities," John Branca, the estate's co-executor, told The Associated Press. "This is personal for us." A Jackson-themed Broadway show, "MJ The Musical" is scheduled to start previews in July, though like the rest of Broadway it is currently on hold amid the coronavirus shutdown. No announcements have been made on postponing the show, and the estate and producers are taking a wait-and-see approach, Branca said. Related video: Celebrities who have made donations during coronavirus outbreak "Michael Jackson ONE," the long-running Jackson-based Cirque du Soleil show at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, where Jackson lived late in his life, is also on hold indefinitely. "Las Vegas has been very good to Michael," Branca said. The estate's donation there will provide 300,000 meals to the needy, and help to maintain the supplies of the food bank Three Square, the estate said. In New York, the estate says it is donating to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS' COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Fund, and will give the rest to MusiCares, the charitable branch of the Recording Academy that helps those in the music industry who are economically struggling. The estate said the donations are inspired by the constant charitable work of Jackson himself. "Michael was extremely generous both of his time and his money in his life, and it's in his music too," Branca said. "We look to Michael for leadership and inspiration. We're doing what Michael would have been doing."For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

How to quarantine your home if you or a loved one tests positive for COVID-19

What happens next depends on your specific circumstances.

It's a scenario all too many of us are facing — or will soon face.You or a loved one has a mild fever, body aches, the start of a nagging, dry cough. Food doesn't taste good nor smell as it once did. Maybe you have shortness of breath or struggle to breath deeply.You've called your doctor, and you are suddenly face-to-face with the scary reality of COVID-19.What happens next depends on your specific circumstances. If you are having trouble breathing or are elderly and fragile, you may be hospitalized and tested for the virus.If you're not in immediate danger but potentially higher risk — you have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension or lung issues; you're over 60; or you are immune-compromised — you may be told to closely monitor your symptoms but shelter at home.The rest of us with symptoms but no additional known risk factors will also certainly be told to stay home, rest and drink plenty of fluids, all while keeping a close eye on how we feel."People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. "Do not leave, except to get medical care."Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is an emergency, the CDC adds, but call first. And don't use public transportation, ride-sharing or taxis to get there.Now what? Are you prepared to take care of yourself if you're alone? What can you do to protect other family members who have been exposed and will have to stay home with you?Prepare in advancePreparation is the key to a good plan.Before anyone in your family or community gets sick, the CDC suggests checking in with loved ones, relatives, neighbors and friends to exchange phone numbers and emails and to find out if anyone will have special needs if they get sick. Have a list of your own emergency numbers handy. It should include your health care provider, local public health department, local hospital and ambulance service.Hopefully, you've been following standard hygiene practices. These are behaviors we should be doing daily, automatically, to protect ourselves from germs, colds and flu:Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; cough and sneeze into elbows or tissues that you immediately throw away, and regularly wash, wash, wash those hands with warm water and lots of soapy bubbles.Check out this proper handwashing technique to try while singing along to a song. (If you're tired of "Happy Birthday," here are some cool tunes you can substitute.) When you can't use soap and water, use hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol and rub thoroughly.The CDC says you should also be cleaning frequently touched surfaces daily with a regular household cleaner followed by a disinfectant. In addition to bathroom surfaces, tables and countertops, don't forget light switches, faucets and sinks, cabinet handles, doorknobs, phones and keyboards.Social distancing is critical to containing the virus; stay and work from home if that's possible, and limit contact with others — no cookouts, no play-dates, no face-to-face dates.When you do leave for life's necessities, such as food and outdoor exercise, stay at least 6 feet away from others. (Make sure you can eyeball how long six feet actually is.)Parents and guardians should plan well in advance by setting up a structure in which all kids and potential caregivers know their roles and expectations, said pediatrician Dr. Tanya Altmann, Editor-in-Chief of the American Academy of Pediatrics' book "Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5 and The Wonder Years.""Many parents are going to get sick," Altmann said. "So what's the game plan? How are we going to isolate them and who's going to be the backup parent? You need to know what to do so you're not panicked and struggling if one parent gets a fever in the middle of the night."If possible, have a designated bedroom and private bathroom ready to use. Stock the room with all relevant forms of entertainment: TV, computer, iPad, books, even games that you could play via FaceTime or Skype.Speaking of planning, here's a list of some basic supplies to have on hand:A working thermometer to monitor fever, which is considered to be 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), and a method to clean it, such as isopropyl alcohol.Fever reducing medications, such as acetaminophen.A box of rubber or latex disposable gloves and face masks. Face masks are for the sick and caregivers only — they are in short supply and should not be used by those who are not sick, the CDC says.A 60- or 90-day supply of necessary prescription medicines.Regular soap and 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Tissues to cover sneezes and coughs. But there's really no need to hoard toilet paper. This is a respiratory disease.Regular cleaning supplies, kitchen cleaning gloves and trash can liners.Disinfectant cleaning supplies — the CDC suggests picking from a list that meets the virus-fighting standards of the Environmental Protection Agency, but says you can also make your own version by using 1/3 cup unexpired bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water. Never mix bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. It produces toxic gases.Isolate yourself or loved oneOnce your health care provider tells you COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, the CDC says you or your loved one should stay in a separate room (preferably with a private bathroom) away from other people in the household.If you live alone, that's not difficult. Your challenge is to monitor your symptoms and care for yourself when you're not feeling well. Be sure to have a plan in place to deliver food and medications, and find someone who can be responsible for virtually checking in on you on a regular basis.If you are part of a family, staying isolated can be challenging, especially if it's a small space or there are children in the home."If you have somebody at home who's older or immunocompromised, you may want to isolate them to one side of the house so the kids and everybody else aren't around them on a regular basis," Altmann said."If it's a child that you have to care for, then you may have to make the decision to isolate one adult with the child," she added. "That adult would be caring for the child, and the other adult would be responsible for the rest of family."And of course all of this will be extremely difficult for a single parent "who might be the only one," said pediatrician Dr. Jenny Radesky, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics."Know who your neighbors are, even what your neighborhood social network might be," said Radesky, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. "You may not be that close interpersonally, but someone may be willing to do a grocery store drop-off, or pick-up medications because we're all in this together."Cover up and disinfectIf you're sick, the CDC says to use a face mask around other people, such as when going to the doctor or hospital."If you are not able to wear a face mask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a face mask if they enter your room," the CDC says.If you are running short on face masks, or don't have any because of hoarding, try to protect the caregiver as best you can, the CDC says.Altmann stresses maximizing isolation and protective actions."You can have a healthy person leave the sick one food and drinks at the door, and then go wash their hands," Altmann explained. "Wear gloves to pick up the empty plates, take them back to the kitchen and wash them in hot water with soap, or preferably with a dishwasher, and wash your hands again."Do not share drinking glasses, cups, forks or other eating utensils or dishes, the CDC says. Don't share towels or bedding with other people in your home. When doing laundry, don't shake the sick person's dirty clothes to "minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air."And caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling that dirty laundry, the CDC says, throwing them away after each use."If using reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed," the CDC advises.Dedicate a lined trash can for any tissues or other paper or disposable products used by a sick person, the CDC says, adding that caregivers should "use gloves when removing garbage bags, handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands after handling or disposing of trash."One last, very important thing: Call 911 immediately if you or your loved ones have any of these symptoms: increased or sudden difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; a persistent pain or pressure in the chest; and any sign of oxygen deprivation, such as new confusion, bluish lips or face, or you can't arouse the sick person.While these are key danger signs, this is not an exhaustive list, says American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris, so call if anything concerns you."If the symptoms don't get better or they worsen you should call your health care provider, the urgent care or the emergency department," Harris said. "And if the shortness of breath is severe, immediately call 911."Keeping everyone else from getting sickTry to keep air flowing in the rest of the home with opened windows or doors with screens, or with air conditioning. Have everyone wash their hands at every opportunity. Clean and disinfect all those commonly shared surfaces — don't forget the refrigerator and microwave handles!Keep everyone as stress free as possible — a hard task for sure — and focus on healthy eating, regular exercise and quality sleep.Even though there is no indication that pets can give or get COVID-19, the CDC suggests keeping pets away from sick people."Since animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals," the CDC says. "If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."When is your quarantine over?A recent study that analyzed data coming from China found the incubation period for the virus can range from 1 to 14 days, with 95% of the patients experiencing symptoms within 12.5 days of contact.That falls in line with current U.S. recommendations that require a two-week quarantine for anyone exposed to the virus. Keep this in mind when estimating an isolation period for family members who may have become sick after a loved one.As for the person with the coronavirus symptoms, the CDC says you may be well when you "no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers), and other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved), and you received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart." Check with your health care provider for full instructions.These are scary times, but hopefully these tips will help ease your anxiety and prepare you and your family for the worst, while hoping and striving for the best.

Coronavirus case confirmed in Southern California, brings total cases in US to 13
.W
This is the seventh confirmed case of coronavirus in California and the 13th in the United States.

The first confirmed case of novel coronavirus has been found among hundreds of people who were evacuated from China to military bases around the United States, it was reported Monday.The adult and three other evacuees had been in hospital isolation after showing symptoms of the virus but on Sunday, federal health officials said they had tested negative and they were sent back to the base, where they joined more than 200 people who are under a 14-day quarantine.On Monday morning, however, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention informed county health officials that “further testing revealed that one of the four patients tested positive" for novel coronavirus and the person was returned to hospital isolation, UC San Diego Health said in a statement.Another evacuee from Miramar also was hospitalized for evaluation Monday afternoon, UC San Diego Health said in a statement.“Both patients are doing well and have minimal symptoms," the statement said.This is the seventh confirmed case of novel coronavirus in California and the 13th in the United States.The person confirmed to have the illness arrived at Miramar last Wednesday from Wuhan. That locked-down city of 11 million is the epicenter of the highly contagious disease, which has killed more than 1,000 people overseas.Recent chartered flights have sent hundreds of people back to the U.S. They are being held in quarantine at military bases in California, Texas and Nebraska.Five evacuees taken to Travis Air Force Base, located between San Francisco and Sacramento, were hospitalized after showing symptoms of the virus but none of those possible cases has been confirmed, authorities said.Some 200 evacuees at March Reserve Air Base in Southern California were scheduled to be released from their two-week quarantine on Tuesday.No symptoms were reported among evacuees at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio or a Nebraska National Guard training base in Omaha.
