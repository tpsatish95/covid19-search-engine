Drive-In Movie Theaters Making A Comeback Amid Coronavirus Crisis
.W
With most indoor theaters shut down to slow the spread of COVID-19, a cultural relic from the 20th century is poised for a major comeback in the era of social distancing.

PLYMOUTH, Ind. (CBS Local)  — With most indoor theaters shut down to slow the spread of COVID-19, a cultural relic from the 20th century is poised for a major comeback in the era of social distancing.  Drive-in theaters, which combined America’s passion for automobiles and movies, peaked in popularity during the 1950s and early 1960s. Many closed down as more people chose to watch movies indoors or at home.   More than 40,000 movie theater screens nationwide are now dark and Americans sheltering in place are turning to drive-ins for much-needed out-of-the-house entertainment.   There were 305 drive-in theaters with a total of 549 screens throughout the United States as of October, according to the  United Drive-in Theater Owner Association .   While some drive-in theaters caught in the umbrella shutdown of non-essential services are still closed, others are starting to reopen.     BREAKING: Plymouth's Tri-Way Drive-In is opening this weekend after all. https://t.co/Y1kPpTZYJk   — WSBT (@WSBT)  April 30, 2020     Tri-Way Drive-In Theatre  in Plymouth, Indiana opened Friday, presenting a double-feature on two screens.   “I think everybody is ready to get out and see some entertainment, get out of the house, enjoy themselves and basically, you know, chill,” David Kinney, the theater’s owner and operator, told  CBS affiliate WSBT . “But we’re here not only for their entertainment, but for their safety.”   But there are still some restrictions are in place due to the coronavirus. For example, only one car can park between poles.   “Patrons must stay in their vehicle except to go to the restroom or get concessions, and you must wear a face mask or covering over your mouth and nose for these purposes,” the theater wrote on its  Facebook page .   A limited number of people are allowed in the restrooms. Concessions may be ordered from a take out window as long as social distancing is maintained.

Airbnb: No Parties In Baltimore Until Further Notice Due To Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Airbnb is warning hosts in Baltimore not to authorize renters to throw parties during the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Airbnb is warning hosts in Baltimore not to authorize renters to throw parties during the coronavirus pandemic.  Under normal circumstances, Airbnb will allow its hosts to set house rules about events or parties. May is normally a time for graduation celebrations, baby or bridal showers or other special events, but Airbnb says they won’t allow it.   “We have previously announced that we will not allow for hosts to authorize parties and events in regions where current public health mandates prohibit events and gatherings,” an Airbnb statement reads. “Governor Hogan’s executive order very clearly bans social gatherings in the state, meaning our new policy means we are not allowing any type of party in Baltimore until further notice.”   Baltimore City Health Commission Ask Residents Not To Throw Parties As Weather Gets Warmer   Currently under the governor’s order, gatherings of more than 10 people are discouraged. The city and state of Maryland are under a stay at home order, which means residents should stay at home unless they are going out for essential reasons or exercise.   “We want to be very clear — not only will we ban guests who attempt to throw an unauthorized party in a Baltimore Airbnb listing, we will be cooperating with Baltimore Police in any investigations relating to parties and violations of public health mandates, consistent with our Terms of Service,” the company added.   To further deter hosts or renters from throwing parties, the company has disable the event-friendly” search filter.   On Tuesday, city health commissioner Letitia Dzirasa also warned against residents throwing parties, because they are endangering their health and the health of others.   “As the weather begins to warm, we acknowledge that it will be increasingly difficult for residents who abide by the stay at home order,” said Dzirasa. “Just this past weekend, we saw a number of house party and cookout invitations go out on social media.”   Dzirasa reminded residents that if they are inviting friends over for a cookout, graduation ceremony, Cinco de Mayo or Mother’s Day brunch, they are putting themselves, their friends, family and neighbors at risk of contracting COVID-19.   Airbnb said it’s proud of its hosts that have opened up their rentals to frontline workers.   “During this challenging time, our host community has stepped up in an extraordinary way by offering 200,000 places to stay globally for COVID-19 responders through Airbnb’s Frontline Stays program,” a statement from Airbnb continues. “We are incredibly proud of hosts in cities around the world who have offered their homes to those on the front lines and in need of shelter, and we thank them for providing this critical need for safe accommodations at such an important moment in history.”   For latest information on our COVID-19 response, from policy updates to resources for hosts and guests, please visit  airbnb.com/covid19.

Subway, Chick-fil-A Adapt To Social Distancing As Coronavirus Pandemic Grinds On
.W
Some of the most popular restaurants in the United States are having to get creative to get by in the era of social distancing.

(CBS Local)  — Some of the most popular restaurants in the United States are having to get creative to get by in the era of social distancing.  Confined primarily to drive-thru, takeout and delivery services, many food establishments are rolling out new services, products and approaches.   For example, Subway has  launched  a contactless pickup and delivery grocery service. Subway Grocery is already available at 1,200 locations in 35 states. The website indicates that new states and locations are being added every day.     Subway Grocery lets you order items online for contactless pickup or delivery. Someone has to try this and let us know how it is.  https://t.co/9fnDICaoDG   — The Takeout (@thetakeout)  April 30, 2020     Just about anything that can be crafted by a Subway sandwich artist is now available for you to build at home. That includes your favorite Subway bread, a wide variety of protein, cheeses, fresh vegetables, plus two-pound bags of signature soups, bulk pouches of sauce — plus cookies, chips and beverages.   And as more people eat at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, more restaurants are offering meal kits.   Chick-fil-A will start selling a  chicken parmesan kit  for two (for $14.99) as soon as May 4 — and can be delivered or ordered at the drive-thru.     Chick-fil-A is rolling out a meal kit as more people eat at home because of the coronavirus pandemic.  https://t.co/Fm8GZpnhdC   — CNN Business (@CNNBusiness)  April 30, 2020     The kit includes two breaded filets, marinara sauce, cheese and a side of creamy garlic and lemon pasta. Customers can swap out the breaded filets for grilled or spicy chicken. The chicken is pre-cooked, so customers just have to reheat the filets at home.   And the owners of Fat Rice, one of the Chicago’s most beloved restaurants, believe that dining out, as we knew it before COVID-19, is over.     Since things will probably never be the same again, Fat Rice closes as a restaurant and reopens as a grocery store.  https://t.co/K0pQCFG0sk   — The Takeout (@thetakeout)  April 29, 2020     They’ve closed the restaurants but  will open  Fat Rice Mart in its place, selling Asian and Portuguese pantry items, wine and beer, and meal kits with ingredients and recipes so that customers can make their own Fat Rice dishes at home.   Instead of 70 employees (who were laid off and sent home with food packages when Illinois instituted its stay at home order in mid-March), it will have just eight.

Due To Coronavirus, Maryland Book Bank Turns Book Collection Into Giveaway

Thanks to the Maryland Book Bank, more than 400 kids now have a new selection of books to read while being stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Thanks to the Maryland Book Bank, hundreds of kids now have a new selection of books to read while being stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The organization turned what is normally its largest book collection day of the year into a book giveaway.   “What we’ve done is we’ve made it a distribution day because so many families are asking us for books right now,” said Mark Fiering with the Maryland Book Bank.   Modeling after the restaurant industry, families could place an order for a bag of books. The group picked out books based on the child’s age.   “It’s all contactless; we put it right in their trunk,” Fiering said. “So it’s pretty easy for us to do and were able to supply at least 10 books per child.”   In total, they’re giving out books to more than 400 kids, including avid reader Gregory Areford.   “You pick up a book and it takes you somewhere else,” the 15-year-old said.   Thanks to the Maryland Book Bank, he now has 10 more books in his library.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This is amazing,” Areford said. “I have no idea what I got. It was kind of like a random pick and I might find something that I didn’t know I would like.”   In a challenging time, the books give kids something else to do that’s educational.   “Parents are just really in need of something that makes their kids feel better,” Fiering said. “They’re continuing their homeschooling because they don’t have any choice, so they’re looking for something that suits them or something that keeps them engaged and continuing to learn.”   And those parents certainly do appreciate it   “This is awesome, it’s getting really tough with the library’s being closed because this one goes through books like that,” Tracy Lingo, a parent, said.   “Just to have an old-school opportunity to have a book in your hand, it’s really great,” Cassandra Thomas, another parent, added.   The Maryland Book Bank said they’re planning for the long-haul. They’d like to be able to continue doing things like this for at least the next six months.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Maryland Office of Tourism is looking to give families something to do at home during the COVID-19 pandemic while inspiring their future travel plans in the state.  While tourism has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, the agency has found a way for people to explore the state without leaving home.   A trip to the National Aquarium may be off the table, but the Engel family recently spent time visiting virtually.

The activities range from taking a 3D tour of a lighthouse playing a game of This or That — Maryland style.   On top of giving them something to do, it gives them something to look forward to.   “What I actually like was the Maryland bingo,” Engel said. “It was a fun way to reminisce about some of the stuff that we’ve done but, we’ve also been able to create a bucket list of stuff we want to do once we can.”   All the activities are free.

As Allergy Season Hits, Here’s How To Tell If Your Symptoms Are Allergies Or Coronavirus

Regular allergy sufferers know the sniffles alone can mean business, but amid the coronavirus pandemic, some wonder whether their coughs and shortness of breath are from allergies or COVID-19.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  On a Friday afternoon in Baltimore, you’ll still see people running along Patterson Park. The slight breeze brings fresh air, but the allergy reports are a constant reminder pollen is gaining on us.  Tree pollen is high, while mold, grass and weed pollens are considered moderate.   Regular allergy sufferers know the sniffles alone can mean business, but amid the coronavirus pandemic, some wonder whether their coughs and shortness of breath are from allergies or COVID-19.   “I have to check why I’m coughing, why do I think I’m coughing and things like that,” 70-year-old Wayne Lampkin said while adjusting his black mask. “I don’t see anything so far associated with corona but I don’t know corona.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Bethany Ely of Baltimore is well aware of her condition every day.   “I’ve been keeping track of my temperature. With allergies, you might have a cough or sneezing but if you have a fever, then that’s when I would start to worry about the coronavirus,” she said.   Dr. Paula Whittington of Kaiser Permanente described the symptoms people should be on the lookout for.   “Chills, muscle aches, you wouldn’t see that in allergies,” she said, “but there may definitely see shortness of breath if you have underlying asthma.”   It can be confusing, she said, but it’s important to get ahead of allergies early.   “You have to be consistent with your therapy. I tell my patients who have recurring springtime allergies to start that medicine before the tree pollen season hits the air,” she said.   Whittington knows stress levels are high but when in doubt, you should know who to call.   “Reach out to us,” she said. “We’re here for virtual visits. You don’t have to come to the office.”   Whittington said she’s not going to tell people to not go outside but added those with allergies should make sure to take their medication and take a shower to wash off the pollen as soon as they return home.

In an effort to help struggling local businesses, the Downtown Partnership has launched a new initiative called #CurbsideBaltimore.   “It’s an attempt to do a couple (of) things. One, to help put an infusion of cash into downtown restaurants, and it also provides incentives for residence, residents and people to come out and give back,” Shelonda Stokes, the group’s interim president, said.

There are currently 25 downtown businesses participating, including six at the Mount Vernon Market Place.

Annapolis Theaters Have Financial And Cancellation Concerns Due To COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
While many businesses are struggling nationwide with paying salaries and dealing with layoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the theater industry has been hit particularly hard.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) —  While many businesses are struggling nationwide with paying salaries and dealing with layoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the theater industry has been hit particularly hard.   With some jobs, working remotely is still possible. However, what about an industry where its primary source of income is heavily reliant on audiences gathering in one place?   It has not been easy. In Annapolis, the outdoor Summer Garden Theatre has to rent space in order to rehearse. However, since the shutdown orders, the rehearsal space has been closed, and rehearsing has been hard, Carolyn Kirby, president of the board of directors at the theater, told Capital News Service on March 30 via a phone call.   The theater’s season has three shows scheduled, with the first one, “Rock of Ages,” having been in its last stages of completion. It was postponed to the 2021 season even after having had about nine months of work done on it, but “now everything is in question,” Kirby said.   For a performance in July, she said, you need more practice. However, the theater and board members are having to work with “a day-to-day solution.”   Another Annapolis theater has been in a similar situation. The Colonial Players, a non-profit, all-volunteer organization had to push back their shows as well, as a result of the pandemic.   The theater does own its rehearsal and performance space, but has financial concerns over production deposits that have already been made and the salaries for the support staff, since the theater does not have any income coming in.   Steve Tobin, the vice president of the Colonial Players, said via a phone interview that the theater is very thankful for donations in lieu of tickets from the community.   The donations are tax-deductible donations to the theater.   “We’re very grateful that it looks right now—at least right now—that the financial impacts are not as bad as they could have been,” Tobin said, thanks to the donations.   He continued that though people have their own financial issues, they still donate — and that is “very heartwarming.”   “Through their generosity, we will be able to recover relatively quickly in the fall,” Tobin said. “That’s a gift from our patrons.”   The Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre also faces production-related financial concerns.   Having to give refunds to people who have already bought tickets “is a scary situation,” Kirby said.   She said that $43,000 worth of tickets were sold and now the situation is extremely uncertain, with the team having to consider canceling their upcoming shows.   Aside from the financial concerns, the performance and production teams also face a disappointment factor — of having worked months on a show and not getting to perform.   The Colonial Players, the Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre and the Annapolis Shakespeare Company expressed disappointment over the loss of shows.   Shirley Panek, president of the Colonial Players theater, also works as the vice president of a technology firm — as do most of the theater’s volunteers. “We do what we do because it’s a passion,” she said.   “Just because we don’t pay people, doesn’t mean that we haven’t put in blood sweat and tears,” Tobin said.   “They (the performers) are disappointed, but they understand,” Kirby said.   Sally Boyett, artistic director with the Annapolis Shakespeare Company, told Capital News Service that their theater had to lay off all their staff except for her and another member.   Boyett said it was devastating to see people she had employed for a show watch that show be shut down.   She continued that though they understand “what has to happen for the public health” that it doesn’t take away from the devastation it has caused for the artists.   One of the key issues coming back from the pandemic shutdowns will be to get the audiences to get back into the habit of watching the plays, Boyett said.   Though she continued that she hopes for the best as “there’s only so much Netflix you can take.”   Jason Vellon works at Sandy Spring Bank, and also as a performer.   Though most community performers do it for the enjoyment of the work rather than the monetary compensation, he said that having a show canceled “is like a death, it’s like something is being ripped from you.”   Vellon and his wife, Ashley Gladden-Vellon, were set to perform this week at the Anne Arundel Community College Theater for the show “Beauty and the Beast” and through a tough audition, his wife was cast as Belle and he as Gaston.   When the director, who is also Vellon’s friend, was telling his wife that the show had to be canceled, she started shedding tears, and so did the director.   “You know that, that it was the right choice to stop that show,” Vellon said. “But it is still a painful loss.”   “Being on stage, it’s kind of like a drug,” he said. But he continued that “for us, it’s part of who we are.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)

Coronavirus Latest: COVID-19 Testing Site At Pimlico Race Course Officially Opens
.W
Baltimore City’s first coronavirus testing site is now open in the parking lot of Pimlico Race Course.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore City’s first coronavirus testing site is now open in the parking lot of Pimlico Race Course.  The neighborhoods around the course have been heavily affected by the virus, with 64 cases reported in the 21215 zip code. That’s more than any other part of Baltimore.   Some area residents said it was a good idea to build the site at Pimlico.   “We get sick just like everybody else, you know what I mean? And we need it just like everybody else,” Edward Holden, of Park Heights, said.   The Baltimore City Health Department and Office of Emergency Management will operate the site with the help of the Maryland National Guard, LifeBridge Health and other partners.   But, as Amanda Shrout with Sinai Hospital explained, you’ll need to get screened before coming to get tested.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Our patients are able to call 211 and they are put through a screening process,” Shrout said. “Then if they’re deemed appropriate to have COVID-19 testing, they are given an appointment.”   Patients will come in off the Belvedere Avenue entrance and be met by the National Guard who will then confirm the appointment.   They’ll remain in their car the whole time, except when being swabbed, and will then get the results back in four to five days.   Lifelong resident David Hollins said that regardless of what’s happening in the neighborhood, he‘s just glad to see a site created in the city.   “It’s the fact that it’s in Baltimore, period,” Hollins said. “And that’s where it’s needed so it doesn’t really matter what side of town it’s on. They’ve got a lot of space here, so that makes sense to me.”   The city tells WJZ that they are continuing to analyze the data and that will drive where their resources will go.

‘We Were In Love’ | Maryland Couple Hold Wedding Ceremony In Backyard During Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Huge life moments have been sacrificed for safety during the coronavirus pandemic, and rightfully so.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Huge life moments have been sacrificed for safety during the coronavirus pandemic, and rightfully so.  One Maryland couple is seeing the bright side, however, and hope you will do the same.   Now, husband and wife, Kevin and Stephanie Greer dreamt bigger than backyard vows for their May 1 wedding, but when COVID-19 changed that, so did their minds.   “My expectations of what I thought a wedding would be was just really stripped that day, and I thought it brought me to the meat of the commitment that I was making,” Stephanie said.   Their choice became clear. Marriage was far more important than planned dances and elaborate spreads.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Really think about why we do things and just get to the heart of each matter,” Kevin said. “What’s really important. You know, what’s the driving factor.”   And family was the driving force. They’re thankful for technology that even allowed Stephanie’s dad to virtually walk her down the aisle.   “I have a mother who is a breast cancer survivor, who has a weakened immune system, and so she wasn’t able to travel,” Kevin said. “I have a sister who is pregnant, who is not able to travel. Just a lot of the things that were important to us, like having family their, became a disappointment when we knew that they couldn’t come. But overall, we’ve been really content, it’s been a good time to just reflect on what really is important.”   “We were in love and wanted to be with each other,” Kevin added.   With all kinds of milestones being pushed and postponed, the couple wants you to know your feelings are valid.   “It’s okay to grieve the fact that this is not normal,” Stephanie said. “I think we live in such a fast paced society that we thought we’d get the fixer upper soon, like this will be fixed.”   We don’t know what fixed looks like just yet, but the Greer’s are blissfully aware in their newlywed nest.   “I mean sure, her stuff is where my stuff should be,” Kevin joked. “I have the whole closet.”   They are now encouraging everyone to create your own happily every after.   “We recognize our situation isn’t like everybody else’s and there are a lot of things that can’t move and shift for someone to have our same story. That’s built in us a lot of gratitude,” Stephanie said. “And then think, ‘Ok, what can I focus on that is going great, what can I be grateful for?'”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Larry Hogan said at a press briefing Friday afternoon. “We know we’re still heading up that curve—going uphill. But we don’t know how high the climb is going to be, how long it’s going to take to get there, or when it will level off.”   Annis Creese was known as ‘mom’ to many of her students. The longtime high school Spanish teacher in Prince George’s County is one of Maryland’s victims of COVID-19. The beloved grandmother died suddenly after testing positive.   “She was a true humanitarian, and sometimes I think selfless to a fault,” her son Michael Hyland said.

The comptroller projects a a $2.8 billion budget shortfall. Gov. Hogan announced a state hiring and spending freeze. The exceptions are for COVID-19-related expenses and meeting current payroll.   “I just put everybody on notice today, that it’s very unlikely that anything requiring additional spending will be signed into law,” Hogan said.   The General Assembly passed the massive Kirwan-commission education reform bill that awaits the governor’s signature.

Self-Employed Marylanders Struggle To Claim Unemployment During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
Over the past few weeks, more than 300,000 Marylanders have filed for unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Over the past few weeks, more than 300,000 Marylanders have filed for unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  But for those who are self-employed, the process has proven to be difficult.   Jessica Durden is a professional makeup artist and certified eyelash technician. She started her business, JessieD Creations, five years ago.   It’s a business that has been deemed non-essential during the COVID 19 pandemic.   “For about a month now, I have not received any income,” Durden said. “I have not been able to work.”   The single mother relies on her business to support her, and her daughter. She said she applied for grants and loans, but keeps running into roadblocks.   “I have applied just hoping that I would still at least be able to receive some sort of aid,” she said. “But one application they’re asking for an unemployment insurance number which I don’t have because I don’t have employees.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Initially, she wouldn’t have been eligible for unemployment benefits, but the CARES Act has expanded coverage. The problem is, the State’s system is not currently set up to process CARES act claims. On top of that, her stimulus check has yet to arrive.   “It just seems like a lot of running in circles, a lot of misinformation, a lot of inaccurate information and it’s frustrating,” she said.   The Maryland Department of Labor is asking for patients as they work through this problem.   In just one week, the Department of Labor has received over 42,000 new unemployment insurance claims.   “I can see how they are working very, very hard to rectify this issue,” Durden said. “However, I feel as though they should’ve been at the forefront. They should have been more proactive as opposed to reactive.”   Durden said she has been able to lean on her family and friends during these difficult times.   The Maryland Department of Labor recently announced a new, one-stop application that can handle the new claims will be available on Friday.

LARGO, Md. ( CNN) —  As the coronavirus pandemic intensified, Leilani Jordan insisted on going to her job as a clerk at a Maryland grocery so she could help seniors, her mother said.  She had challenges of her own, as a worker with cerebral palsy. But as shoppers around the country raided shelves for necessities in early to mid-March, Jordan wanted to make sure the elderly got theirs.   “It’s just crazy here at work … but somebody’s got to do it,” Jordan said, according to her mother, Zenobia Shepherd. “I’ve got to help the older people.”   RELATED STORIES:     Coronavirus Latest: More Than 7.6K COVID-19 Cases, 200 Deaths Reported In Maryland   Prince George’s County To Require Face Coverings For All Shoppers, Commuters   Giant Announces 2 New Social Distancing Policies Following Employee Death     “She was doing everything for them: Helping them put their groceries in their walkers, to helping them get into lifts,” Shepherd said.   Then the 27-year-old became sick.   The clerk for a  Giant Food  store in Largo, a few miles east of Washington, was hospitalized with coronavirus in March and died last week, her family said.   “It was my baby!” Shepherd, crying, told CNN’s “New Day” Wednesday. “All she wanted to do was just help people.”   It isn’t clear how Jordan got Covid-19. But she was working in a type of essential business where people still must gather at in a time when health officials would rather people stay apart — and her family feels she wasn’t properly protected.   “She (told me), ‘Mom, there is no masks here, there is no gloves, there is no hand sanitizer, ” Shepherd said.   Jordan last worked at the store on March 16, the company said. Giant Food has said it was saddened to confirm Jordan died of coronavirus.   “We can only imagine the heartache they (her family) are experiencing and have offered our support during this difficult time,” the company said.

Since then, the CDC has updated its recommendations, and the company now is supplying its workers with plastic face shields, which they can wear if they choose.   Giant stores have always had hand sanitizer and/or cleaning products available for workers, the company said, adding the company has no record of a request or complaint from Jordan.   The company mandates only that its food service workers wear gloves, but other workers always have been allowed to wear them, and can if interested, it said.   She secretly made a goodbye video , stepfather says   In the moments before Jordan died, she was intubated, unable to talk.   But, unbeknownst to her family, she’d already recorded her goodbyes.   Her stepfather, Charles, was at home after she died, going through some of her things.   “She (had taken) her password off of her phone,” so it wasn’t locked, he told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.   He found a video with a heart-wrenching message.   “She made a video saying goodbye to all us, and wished everybody the best,” he said.   “She told us bye; her sisters, (and her service dog) Angel, bye; and all her friends.   “She told them, you know, ‘See you on the other side.'”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Last weekend Baltimore County had 11 Saturday food pick-up sites.

BALTIMORE COUNTY, Md. (WJZ) —  Last weekend Baltimore County had 11 Saturday food pick-up sites.  This weekend, however, that was bumped up to 30, thanks largely in part to the Maryland National Guard.   23,100 meals; that’s how many were given out by Baltimore County Saturday morning.   “It’s very important by me being out of work and I have two great grandkids to take care of while my granddaughter works,” one Baltimore County resident told WJZ.   The meals were purchased by the county from local caterers, and were given to those who are struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.   “This is a help for real, God bless America,” the same Baltimore County resident told WJZ.   Aiding in the distribution was the Maryland National Guard, allowing the county to nearly triple their number of distribution sites from 11 to 30 in just a week.

Popular Farmers Market In Harford County Opens Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

A popular farmers market opened Saturday in Harford County amid the coronavirus pandemic.

BEL AIR, Md. (WJZ) —  A popular farmers market opened Saturday in Harford County amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Though Gov. Larry Hogan has had many businesses close, the market is considered essential, but has to operate within the governor’s guidelines.   A Harford County parking lot, which is usually bustling with customers, now has socially distanced spaced lines at the few booths that are open.   “A little bit different today, not a lot of stands open, but a fair number of people keeping an eye on the social distancing,” a customer told WJZ.   The farmers marker in Bel Air attracts hundreds of families most spring weekends.   “A lot more vendors, a lot of dogs, it’s just nice even when it is packed like that. We know we are supporting local business, so I appreciate that,” another customer said.   Supporting these businesses, to Hillary Tayson, is like a trip to the grocery store.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “You go to the grocery store to get your essential food products like produce and fruit, meat and cheese, and all of that is available here at the farmers market,” Tayson said.   And for Stacey Davis’ family, the products offered here is educational for her kids who are stuck at home and anxious to get back to learning   “The kids are confused and angry and they want to get back to school and their friends,” Davis said.   Many people made their way around the market with a mask, respecting the CDC’s suggestion.   Harford County tells WJZ the market is on their property, but owned by a private entity, and Gov. Hogan has granted them permission to do business.   Customers said vendors were following guidelines and wearing masks to conduct businesses, while working to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Consider it an act of love.”   County Executive Alsobrooks also reminds Prince Georgians about the Governor’s stay-at-home order this Easter weekend, asking residents to resist the urge to visit family members for large gatherings, and instead, host virtual celebrations with family and friends.

Smoking Weed Could Raise Your Risk Of COVID-19 Complications, Experts Say
.W
If you're smoking weed to ease your stress during the coronavirus pandemic, experts say it's time to think twice.

(CNN) —  If you’re smoking weed to ease your stress during the coronavirus pandemic, experts say it’s time to think twice.  Smoking marijuana, even occasionally, can increase your risk for more severe complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.   “What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo,  chief medical officer for the American Lung Association . “Now you have some airway inflammation and you get an infection on top of it. So, yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”   Hey wait, you might say, I’ve only just started and I’m not smoking much — so what’s the harm?   The problem, said Dr. Mitchell Glass, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the American Lung Association, is that the last thing you want during a pandemic is to make it more difficult for a doctor to diagnose your symptoms.   “Covid-19 is a pulmonary disease,” Glass said. “Do you really want to have a confounding variable if you need to see a doctor or a healthcare worker by saying, ‘Oh, and by the way, I’m not a regular user of cannabis, but I decided to use cannabis to calm myself down.’   “You don’t want to do anything that’s going to confound the ability of healthcare workers to make a rapid, accurate assessment of what’s going on with you,” he added.   Is that cough from smoking or coronavirus?   “Chronic” marijuana smoking, defined as daily use, damages the lungs over a period of time. The end result “looks a lot like chronic bronchitis, which is of course one of the terms we use for chronic obstructive lung disease, or COPD,” Glass said.   Smokers, people with COPD and other chronic lung diseases, as well as people with moderate to severe asthma are  among those at high risk  for severe illness from Covid-19, including the worst-case scenario of being placed on a ventilator in order to continue breathing.   Signs of lung damage from smoking even just a few cigarettes can show up in a matter of days. While a hit or two of marijuana doesn’t compare, there are some unique properties to a joint of weed that are definitely problematic for the lungs even if you’re a new smoker, Glass said.   Think of what happens to a cigarette when lit and left in an ashtray — it will burn quickly all the way down to the filter, with nothing left but ash.   “It’s surrounded by paper. It’s completely dried out. It is made to burn at a very high temperature,” Glass said.   Now think of how a joint burns — there’s always some weed left, the “roach,” as it is called.   “Marijuana burns at a much, much lower temperature than a commercially made cigarette,” said Glass. “Because of that, the person is inhaling a certain amount of unburnt plant material.”   That irritates the lungs in the same manner as ragweed, birch and oak pollen does for those allergic to them, he said.   “So right off the bat there are those patients who would be increasingly susceptible to having a bronchospasm or cough because they have a more sensitive airway.”   And since a dry cough is a key sign of Covid-19, any cough caused by smoking a joint of weed could easily mimic that symptom, making diagnosis more difficult.   The need for a clear head   There’s another factor as well. As we all know, weed not only calms you down, but it messes with your ability to function — and that does you no favors if you find yourself having a medical emergency during a pandemic.   “You’re reducing anxiety, but that is still a change in your thinking, a change in the way you are handling facts, how you’re grasping situations,” Glass said.   “Now there’s a healthcare worker who is gowned, gloved, possibly in a hazmat suit trying to get through to you. These are people who are trying to decide if you should be going home, coming into the emergency room, or worst case scenario, that you need to be put on a ventilator,” he continued.   “They want the person who’s agreeing and giving informed consent to be completely in control of their thought processes.”   More Americans are using weed   In 2018, more than 43 million Americans aged 12 or older reported using marijuana in the past year, according to the  2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  (PDF).   Around four million of those are people with “marijuana use disorder, meaning that this has escalated to the point where it’s a problem in their lives,” said Jessica Hulsey, founder of the  Addiction Policy Forum , which advocates on behalf of patients and families struggling with substance use disorder and addiction.   “Experts at the National Institutes of Health released some guidance for our patients and our families. saying marijuana use disorder could be a risk factor for complications from Covid-19,” Hulsey said.   “Because it attacks the lungs, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape,” t he NIH said in its announcement.   “We need to make sure that these users are aware that marijuana is in essence an underlying health condition,” Hulsey added. “They should take extra precautions by minimizing use to the extent that is possible, and even start virtual treatment and a recovery journey while everyone’s stuck at home.”   The national drug survey also found more than a third of young adults aged 18 to 25 said they used marijuana during 2018, along with more than 13% of adults aged 26 or older.   But it’s not just the young. Earlier this year, a study found  use by older adults is rising sharply.  In 2006, only 0.4% of people over 65 reported using marijuana products in the past year. By 2018, over 4% of those same aged seniors say they are now using, the study found.   “Marijuana use among seniors is not bouncing up and down like with other drugs. It’s a straight line up,” said study co-author Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, in an interview in February.   Are even more Americans turning to weed during this time of crisis?   Simply put, no one knows. Each state handles reporting differently, Glass says, and sales estimates often combine both THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana that produces the “high,” and CBD, the medicinal compound that is now sold over the counter.   “I made a few phone calls and the numbers ranged quite literally from a million to 30 million. So who knows how many people are getting their hands on cannabis to relieve their anxiety during this time,” Glass said.   What to do?   If you’re not a regular smoker of marijuana, don’t start, experts say.   “Don’t confound your caregivers with trying to sort out whether your dry cough and change in behavior is due to the fact that you’re a novice with marijuana or it’s associated with Covid-19,” Glass said.   “If you do need to see a caregiver, be sure you’re very honest with them about when you last used, and how often you use,” Glass said, “so they can get a good, clear story on what the impact of inhaling marijuana is on you.”   Remember the bottom line when it comes to smoking and Covid-19, Rizzo said.   “It’s common sense that anything you inhale that has been combusted and contains particles or chemicals can inflame your airways,” he said. “So you’re already making your body fight off foreign particles before it even has to fight off the infection.”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The city firefighters union issued a statement Friday, calling the city’s proposal to possibly layoff or furlough firefighters after they are risking their lives on the front lines during the coronavirus pandemic a “slap in the face.”  The city is trying to recoup a $103 million budgetary shortfall for fiscal year 2021, which starts on July 1. The options were presented to several city unions, including fire and police, last week.   “None of these options proposed by the city are acceptable and we believe it to be a slap in the face to each of our members, as they are on the front lines of the response to this global pandemic,” President Richard Altieri said.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  On behalf of the National Governors Association, Gov. Larry Hogan and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are asking the federal government for $500 billion to help states struggling with a budget shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic.

While these public health strategies are working to protect the American people, they result in catastrophic damage to state economies.   “Despite this grave challenge, the recently passed federal CARES Act contained zero funding to offset these drastic state revenue shortfalls. To stabilize state budgets and to make sure states have the resources to battle the virus and provide the services the American people rely on, Congress must provide immediate fiscal assistance directly to all states.    “We must be allowed to use any state stabilization funds for replacement of lost revenue, and these funds should not be tied to only COVID-19 related expenses. Congress must amend the CARES Act to allow this flexibility for existing federal funding.    “Moreover, Congress must appropriate an additional $500 billion specifically for all states and territories to meet the states’ budgetary shortfalls that have resulted from this unprecedented public health crisis. This critical stabilization funding for states must be separate from much needed fiscal stabilization for local governments.    “In the absence of unrestricted fiscal support of at least $500 billion from the federal government, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to critically important services all across this country, hampering public health, the economic recovery, and—in turn—our collective effort to get people back to work.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland       What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland       Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In Baltimore city, officials say they will lose $103 million in revenue during fiscal year 2021 which starts on July 1.

Baking During A Pandemic Can Reduce Stress And Provide Comfort, Experts Say
.W
Experts say baking during the coronavirus pandemic can reduce stress and provide comfort.

(CNN) —  Jessica Corradini of Verona, Italy, has been baking bread — mostly sourdough — for a couple years.   Since the coronavirus pandemic shut down Italy, her hobby has become more important than ever to help her feel connected to herself.   Italy had at least 135,000 Covid-19 cases as of April 8, and the virus-stricken country requires its residents to travel with government documents detailing where they’re going and why.   Corradini and her boyfriend have been on lockdown together for almost a month now, only leaving to buy groceries and deliver food to her boyfriend’s parents.   “I can say that [baking] is saving my days and my mind,” she said. “It has never been more important to have a hobby than it is now.”   She’s in good company. People around the world — including nearly all Americans — have been advised or ordered to stay home. Many are taking up bread baking to fill the time and easy their nerves — and enjoy some good bread as a result.   Corradini bakes daily, primarily to pass the long hours of isolation but also to build a community of bread bakers on Instagram, where followers keep each other updated on ingredient availability and exchange advice.   “Baking bread to me is really therapeutic. It makes me feel alive and connected with myself and my dexterity,” she said. “I think it is very important now to re-evaluate our priorities and stay more in touch with ourselves, too.”   She’s also happy to slow down.   “I enjoy the fact that bread making is a slow process, which goes against the rapid lives that we live normally,” Corradini said. “Making bread is slow and engaging, therefore it’s a privilege. Having time and energy to dedicate to this hobby is a privilege. [And] it’s exciting, because you never know the outcome.”   Baking can help your mental health   It’s no surprise that Corradini’s quarantine baking hobby makes her feel better, experts say.   Baking provides a sense of accomplishment, “especially in this period of angst and unknowns,” said Michael Kocet, a licensed mental health counselor and professor and department chair of the Counselor Education Department at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.   Baking can give us something concrete to create, control and enjoy when we have the finished product. That can help reduce the anxiety stemming from the unfamiliarity of dealing with a pandemic, he added.   Specific parts of the baking process also teach lessons applicable to our daily lives and can lead to a state of mindfulness, Kocet said. Kneading, waiting for it to rise, scoring and standing by while it bakes give us time to reflect — and those steps all require patience and precision that can help someone feel centered and focused.   “You may have to prepare the dough and wait to let it rise overnight. There’s a period of waiting that I think is very symbolic of the waiting we’re collectively doing,” Kocet said.   The research backs Kocet up. One study on baking’s impact on mental health found it helped participants gain a sense of purpose, structure their days and increase their motivation levels.   “With baking bread there’s a lot of physicality, and the kneading of the dough and getting it into the right shape can help you relieve some tension,” said Elizabeth McKay, author of the study and associate professor of occupational therapy at Edinburgh Napier University.   Taking on a recipe, such as beginning a sourdough starter, seeing progress from week to week and receiving positive feedback from others can increase confidence levels, McKay said.   “That’s where social media is so good because people are like, ‘Whoa, you made that?’ Even in our shutdown days, you can put it on social media where people give you feedback, and I think that really helps as well,” she added.   Looking out for loved ones   Abigail Rudolph has turned to social media to take orders for her bread.   A teacher who always helped her mother and grandmother in the kitchen when she was young, Rudolph has been baking on and off her whole life, taking what her family matriarchs taught her and making it her own.   When New Mexico closed the public schools, baking was naturally the way she wanted to spend her free time. It also helps ease her depression and anxiety.   “This whole situation has been hard on all of us,” she said. “The baking gives me something positive to focus my mind on, and as a result I get to bring a little happiness into the lives of the people I care about. They’re also doing the same for me.”   Baking gives her a way to check in with loved ones to make sure they’re not “falling off the edge.” It also helps ease her concern that maybe she’s not doing enough to help others.   “It’s something I can do well, a small way that I can put some good out into the world when it feels like it’s falling apart,” Rudolph said. “It keeps me on track and focused during a time when my normal routines aren’t there to support me.”   Through her Instagram profile, Rudolph asks her friends to make baking requests, which she promises to deliver from six feet away within the week.   “The process of getting the requests, making my plans, executing them, chronicling the experience and sharing the recipes is what’s keeping me sane,” Rudolph said. “Each new project keeps me from getting lost in the negativity and guilt, and gives me a sense of purpose.”   How to start baking   If you could use a little baking therapy in your life, Kocet encourages starting with a recipe you’ve always wanted to try, joining a virtual baking club or participating in sharing your photos on social media with the hashtag #quarantinebaking, where other baking fanatics await.   If bread flour or yeast is in short supply in your area — since so many people are baking — why not try a no-yeast bread recipe or even a gluten-free one? Irish soda bread is yeast-free, and there are more than a few hundred gluten-free recipes online.   Some quarantined neighbors in San Francisco have gotten creative by swapping sourdough starters at a safe distance by putting them in plastic bags and tacking them to phone poles.   If you feel stressed about getting started, know that it’s not about creating or baking the perfect loaf of bread. It’s about enjoying oneself as much as we can, experimenting, trying something new, then sharing it virtually, Kocet said.   “Even though this is a difficult time and we don’t know how long this is going to happen, this could clearly go into the summer or much further,” he added.   “How will people maintain their mental health and wellness? Cooking and baking can certainly be a way to do that.”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

‘Jesus Can Come To You’: Marylanders Celebrate Easter Virtually Due To Coronavirus

Easter Sunday looked quite different this year as Marylanders of faith attended services virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.

LOCHEARN, Md. (WJZ) —  Easter Sunday looked quite different this year as Marylanders of faith attended services virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.  One wouldn’t expect to see empty pews and parking lots on one of the holiest days of the year, but because of orders restricting large gatherings, people in Maryland and beyond had to find new ways to worship.   At Christian Life Church in Lochearn, senior pastor Hugh Bair delivered his Easter sermon through a camera lens.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “To be honest with you, it brings a feeling of sadness,” he said. “I’m used to church being full.”   Pews at Christian Life Church in Lochearn sit empty on Easter Sunday due to the coronavirus pandemic.   Like countless others, Christian Life Church has switched to online services.   “We are reaching out by various different platforms of communication like Facebook, trying to connect with people,” Bair said.   The typed “amens” and “hallelujahs” served as proof that the new ways of worship are working and that faith can be practiced even under quarantine.   “That’s the message that I’m trying to convey, to communicate: that Jesus can come to you right where you are,” Bair said.

The Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts has set up the “Baltimore Artists Emergency Relief Fund,” a joint partnership effort designed to provide direct assistance to the city’s artists and entrepreneurs who have lost income due to COVID-19.   “If we don’t support them now, they’re not going to be there for us later. Artists are the ones with the life and the breath of the community. They give us life, they give us vitality,” said BOPA’s arts council director Jocquelyn Downs.   The fund started off with $20,000 but has since risen to $95,000. The group’s goal is to raise $125,000.   To help with immediate needs, the coalition is offering one-time grants of $500 to struggling individual artists in the city.   “We really want to support them and show that we see them,” Downs said.

Gig after gig and paycheck after paycheck were canceled within a matter of days for reasons beyond anyone’s control.   “Many people all over the place rely on artists to relieve that stress,” Nichole said. “You go to bars and you hear the person in the corner playing the acoustic guitar, you go and see a show.”   The artists aren’t just artists — many have families to support.   “I’m a single mother. I have two children who are both out of school, so … you talk about canceling eight weeks of events but still having to support them with new technology for distance learning,” Nichole said.

The employee has not been in the facility in about 10 days, but she says her co-workers still don’t have proper equipment.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Maryland Department of Health reports there are more than 130 nursing homes or long-term care facilities in the state with at least one positive COVID-19 case.   A FutureCare employee who tested positive last week spoke to WJZ on the condition of anonymity.   “They do not have enough PPE. They’ve been asked to wear trash bags. One of my friends described how they were getting swim goggles at the dollar store for the shields,” the employee said. “It was a lack of preparedness, a delay in taking this whole epidemic seriously.”   The employee has not been in the facility in about 10 days but said their co-workers still don’t have the proper equipment.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In a statement to WJZ, FutureCare said its “highest priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our staff and residents.”   The company said it is working to obtain more personal protective equipment. They say they are “following the PPE recommendations outlined by the Maryland Department of Health and CDC.”   The state sent its “strike team” to Calvert Manor Healthcare Center in Cecil County on Saturday. The county health department Monday announced the death of one of the center’s residents, a man in his 80s with underlying health conditions. He said the strike team assessed the facility and determined it is “taking appropriate steps to contain the outbreak.”   Cecil County Health Officer Laura Levy spoke this weekend to the continued lack of testing resources.   “Unfortunately, the testing kit availability remains limited, and so we have to be strategic about our use of testing kits,” Levy said.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Baltimore City Council is asking Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young to issue an executive order requiring everyone in the city to wear masks or face coverings while out in public amid the coronavirus pandemic.  At their second virtual meeting, council members agreed that many employees and customers of essential businesses continue to be at risk of contracting COVID-19 even with the strict measures in place.   “We are putting the lives of those citizens, the lives of those individuals who work in our supermarkets, who are doing the work so we can have some sense of normalcy, at risk,” Council President Brandon Scott said.   In addition to requiring everyone to wear masks, the city council also wants to see all essential businesses institute social distancing practices within their establishments.

When asked for her thoughts on the proposal, Baltimore resident Melissa Alston said it could only help slow the virus’s spread.   “They’re hot, they’re uncomfortable but so is the hospital,” she said.

The chief judge of Maryland's appeals court is ordering lower courts to identify juvenile offenders who could be released amid the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The chief judge of Maryland’s appeals court is ordering lower courts to identify juvenile offenders who could be released amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In a six-page order filed Monday, Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera ordered judges in circuit courts to weigh a number of factors in cases involving juveniles, including the juvenile’s risk for contracting COVID-19, whether releasing a juvenile poses a threat to their safety or the safety of the community and whether supervised release could allow the juvenile to be released safely.   Judges should avoid placing juvenile offenders in jail unless necessary and should look for alternative placements, according to the order. In addition, hearings should be held every 14 days to evaluate if detention is necessary.   Barbera cited the presence of the virus in juvenile facilities as one of the reasons for the updated guidance.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Tells Trump Administration Governors Need $500B In Budget Relief Due To COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
According to state comptroller Peter Franchot, Maryland is expected to see a $2.8 billion shortfall in the final quarter of this fiscal year.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Governor Larry Hogan told the Trump administration Monday that governors need more support to respond to COVID-19.  “Governors are on the front lines of the on-the-ground response, implementing aggressive measures that are beginning to successfully flatten the curve of the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 response is resulting in catastrophic damage to state economies, and fiscal assistance is critical now so that we can continue leading this fight,” he said.   Governors are urging Congress to “act immediately” and appropriate $500 billion specifically for states and territories to meet “budgetary shortfalls” due to the coronavirus pandemic.   “Without sufficient federal relief, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to essential services, which will in turn devastate the economic recovery and our efforts to get people back to work.” He said.

On Monday, Hogan took part in a conference call with Vice President Mike Pence, who President Trump has tapped to the be county’s point person for the coronavirus.   In an appearance on CNN Monday afternoon, Hogan also urged caution to avoid re-opening businesses too quickly.   “Nobody wants to hurt the economy and put people out of work, but mainly we are talking about saving lives,“ the governor said. “The difference between tens of thousands of people dying or bringing that down so we don’t overload the healthcare system, that has got to be our first priority.“   Hogan said governors — not the president — will make the decision on when states will lift stay-at-home orders.   According to state comptroller Peter Franchot, Maryland is expected to see a $2.8 billion shortfall in the final quarter of this fiscal year.   In Baltimore city, officials say they will lose $103 million in revenue during fiscal year 2021 which starts on July 1. As a part of a plan to recoup the money, the city is mulling over several options, including furloughing or laying off many first responders.

How Can Restaurants Recover From Coronavirus?
.W
Jason Bowell, assistant general manager of New York's venerable Beatrice Inn and restaurant industry veteran, sees staff retention as key to a strong comeback.

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —  Dining out has been one of the many social and economic casualties of the coronavirus contagion known as COVID-19. City and state governments all over the country have closed restaurant dining rooms, which were never really set up with social distancing in mind anyway. Only delivery and takeout orders are allowed for the foreseeable future.  Many restaurants have shifted to the new, hopefully short-lived reality. Many more have closed entirely. Whether they’re gone for now or gone for good remains to be seen. But for the time being most restaurant staffers find themselves unemployed, and people who might dine out under normal circumstances find themselves ordering in, if they can even find a place to take their order.   The restaurant industry is suffering, like most of the economy. But there will come a day when people will eat out again. And while the landscape will be drastically different, the experience may be strikingly familiar. Once the health crisis subsides, what will it take for restaurants to open their doors?   Jason Bowell is the assistant general manager at the Beatrice Inn, a traditional New York chophouse that prides itself on its innovative yet timeless meat dishes. Bowell has been managing restaurants for about a decade and worked in the restaurant business for the better part of three decades.   “The restaurants that are going to have not as much trouble getting back on their feet are going to be restaurants that are involved with larger chains,” says Bowell. “Restaurants that are able to pivot well enough to create a good enough online delivery business — delivery and takeout business — are at least going to weather the storm a little bit. And people that are savvy enough to understand how to work their way through getting relief from the government. There are loans being offered, especially for restaurants that are keeping people on staff as paid.”   A successful pivot, even if only to tread water in the short-term, is far from assured for most establishments. There are many factors at play.   “Places with high overhead, like large places that would normally really focus in on getting a lot of guests in and turning those guests over, they’ll be struggling pretty bad,” Bowell points out. “If your business model is based on having large groups of people in your place… your costs per square foot is going to be really hard to cover by doing delivery.”   Those costs could be anything from fixed costs like rent on the space to variable costs like electricity and other utilities. Variable costs, of course, drop with decreased usage. Restaurants sharply reduced their labor costs when governments closed dining rooms and eliminated it entirely if they opted for hibernation. After all, as Bowell points out, “the most important difference between a restaurant that’s going to succeed and one that’s not going to succeed is whether or not you can cover your current costs.”   While reducing or eliminating labor costs may bide time in the short-term, those tactics will also make re-opening that much harder when that time finally comes. “I don’t see the point of not employing people, being in business if you can. If you’re not, not only are you going to have a really hard time not completely folding while the restaurants are closed, but also getting yourself back up to speed when you’re actually allowed to start taking people again.”   Having a staff ready to go when the economy opens its doors again could be the difference between a strong comeback and a dismal end. “It’s about staff retention,” Bowell bluntly puts it. “If I retain my staff, I could probably be open in four or five days. And that’s just to make sure that we’re getting all of our product in and that we’re prepping everything and all the things we need to have ready to go for service are ready to go.”   Not retaining staff means using time for hiring and training that might otherwise be spent serving, and making money from, the public. Another potential hurdle is restocking restaurant kitchens with ingredients.   “You’re going to have a lot of people ordering a lot of stuff really quickly,” says Bowell. “And that’s going to cause issues getting product from point A to point B if you’re having huge, massive orders come across your board. Keep in mind, you make those orders for all that food, it’s all perishable. So it’s all about timing. Restaurants are going to have to wait until they’re stocked up, until they’re prepped and then take a day to open. It might be staggered when those restaurants are opening.”   The few restaurants that can stay open, retain staff and ramp up quickly, can expect banner days as all the pent-up demand fills the marketplace. Diners should expect a far different landscape, however, with fewer dining-out options. According to Bowell, “a lot of those places that shouldn’t have been open, that were on the cusp, are going to be closed. So all the restaurants that are still open are going to benefit from that for awhile.”   The in-house dining experience may largely return to what it was before the pandemic, and restaurant scenes everywhere will find some sort of post-coronavirus existence. But Bowell doesn’t see the world returning to the way it was. “I don’t think there’s ever a normal again after this, because this is really rewriting the way all restaurateurs think about their businesses. It’s going to be a different playing field. I think a lot of people learned a lot of lessons about how their businesses run during this thing. It’s going to change the way they run their businesses right now.”

Those with a keen eye will notice that the words are surrounded by what appear to be purple feathers, which would seem to indicate Jackson doesn’t plan on leaving the Ravens anytime soon.   The artist says this was just the start of a larger piece that Jackson wanted to have done, but they had to stop working for now due to the coronavirus pandemic forcing isolation and stay at home orders.

Judge Denies Injunction Against Bank Of America In Lawsuit Over Coronavirus Small Business Stimulus Program

A federal judge has denied a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against Bank of America in a class-action lawsuit accusing the bank of prioritizing its existing customers when doling out billions of federal dollars as part of a coronavirus stimulus package.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A federal judge has denied a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against Bank of America in a class-action lawsuit accusing the bank of prioritizing its existing customers when doling out billions of federal dollars as part of a coronavirus stimulus package.  A court heard arguments in the case last week. Several small businesses based in Baltimore sued Bank of America, claiming the bank’s plan to give existing customers priority when assigning funds through the Paycheck Protection Program was unfair.   The program includes nearly $350 billion in funding in the form of government-backed loans for small businesses to cover payroll and other expenses amid the pandemic.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Bank of America, meanwhile, had argued it was prioritizing existing customers so it could get the money into the hands of business owners faster.   READ MORE: Lawsuit Accuses Bank Of America Of Prioritizing Existing Customers When Doling Out Federal Coronavirus Relief Funds   In a 23-page opinion filed Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher said Congress is better positioned to make changes to the law than the court:   “The Court will not wade into the merits of this debate. Certainly, Plaintiffs’ experiences demonstrate a significant flaw, from their perspective and that of many other small businesses, in the implementation of the massive and complex PPP program. However, given the competing policy interests, the need to balance the desire to assist the widest swath of small businesses with the need to incentivize lender participation, and the overall fluidity of this epidemic, Congress is better positioned to remedy any defects in the CARES Act, and to pass the supplemental legislation it believes best aimed at ameliorating the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.”   Gallagher also wrote that Bank of America’s argument for prioritizing existing customers was “compelling.”     NEW: Judge Gallagher sides with Bank of America and denies the Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.

Baltimore Violence Continues Despite Governor’s Coronavirus ‘Stay At Home’ Order
.W
Thirteen people were killed in Baltimore since the governor issued a "stay at home" order.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The violence continues in Baltimore despite a “stay-at-home” order issued across the state of Maryland due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Gov. Larry Hogan issued the order on March 30 to slow the spread of COVID-19. The order went into effect at 8 p.m.   However, the “stay at home” order hasn’t stopped the violence in the city.   As of April 14, there have been 13 homicides as well as 24 non-fatal shootings in the city since the order went into effect. This week, in less than 24 hours, there were  four men injured in four separate shootings.   On March 18, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to put down their guns, so that hospital beds could be used to treat coronavirus patients instead of shooting victims.   “We cannot clog up our hospitals and their beds with people that are being shot senselessly because we’re going to need those beds for people infected with the coronavirus,” Young said at the time. “It could be your mother, your grandmother or one of your relatives. So take that into consideration.”   Baltimore Mayor Begs Residents To Stop Shooting Each Other So Hospital Beds Can Be Used For Coronavirus Patients   Despite his plea, the violence has continued and the homicide count has grown.   So far this year there have been 81 homicides and 156 non-fatal shootings. This time last year, there had been 77 homicides and 178 non-fatal shootings.

Police Departments Use Drones To Enforce Social Distancing
.W
Police in New Jersey, Georgia and Florida are deploying five drones to get the message out about practicing social distancing.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (CBS Local)  — Police in Savannah, Georgia, are deploying five drones to get the message out about practicing social distancing.  The drones fly a hundred feet in the air and cover a much larger area than any officer could on foot. Two of them enforce social distancing with pre-recorded messages.   “This is the Savannah Police Department, due to the current health emergency, members of the public are reminded to keep a safe distance of six feet from others,” the message says through a public address system.   Police say they are following Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines and aren’t flying the drones over crowds or in prohibited locations.     Police in Savannah, Georgia, are using drones with pre-recorded messages to enforce social distancing rules in the city.  https://t.co/PZ1EMusy4g   — CBS 17 (@WNCN)  April 14, 2020     “We do not use our drones for random patrol, they’re not flying all the time,” Savannah Police Sergeant Jason Pagliaro told  WSAV . “We use them in directed areas where the need is present.”   The department also confirmed that the drones will not be recording footage or taking pictures.   According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, Chatham County, in which Savannah is located, has 154 active COVID-19 cases and five fatalities.   Police departments in  Daytona Beach, Florida ,  Meriden, Connecticut , and  Elizabeth, New Jersey , are also deploying drones with pre-recorded warnings to emphasize social distancing and stay-at-home orders.     Regarding comments on drones, we are trying to save lives, not be big brother. If this plan saves 1 life, then its worth it. All its doing is spreading an automated notice about social distance. No recording or pictures are taken, just a tool of encouragement to follow the rules.  pic.twitter.com/KnptwsxBQ2   — Elizabeth NJ Police (@epdnj)  April 8, 2020     The tactic was first used in China,  CNN reported  in February. Britain, Spain and France have also used loudspeaker drones to remind residents about travel restrictions and other guidelines.

Despite African Americans making up a majority of the coronavirus cases in Maryland, the city's health commissioner said a widespread rumor is hurting efforts to educate city residents.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Despite African Americans making up a majority of the coronavirus cases in Maryland, the city’s health commissioner said a widespread rumor is hurting efforts to educate city residents.

Accountants Help Small Businesses Navigate Economic Challenges Posed By COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
As small businesses try to keep their companies afloat amid the coronavirus pandemic, many are turning to banks and accountants, keeping those in the financial industry busy.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  As small businesses try to keep their companies afloat amid the coronavirus pandemic, many are turning to banks and accountants, keeping those in the financial industry busy.  Typically around this time of year, accountants are frantically trying to make the April 15 tax filing deadline. Even though that deadline has been extended to July 15 this year, they’re still busy now, helping clients navigate the challenging economic crisis caused by COVID-19.   “We have a number of clients who are in the ‘essential’ business category who are still up and running, but their primary concern aside from the health and well being of their team (is) will they ultimately get paid?” Jeff Rosen, co-managing partner of accounting firm RS&F, said.   Accountants are trying to accommodate small business owners who are increasingly turning to them seeking guidance about loans and other options.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “The advice that they give and the advice that we seek from them is really critical to our being able to move forward, particularly now during this crisis,” said David Nevins, the president of Towson-based public relations firm Nevins and Associates.   Many small business owners across the country are racing to secure their portion of the $349 billion made available by the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created as part of the coronavirus stimulus package officially known as the CARES Act.   The money is available to qualifying small businesses to help them survive the pandemic, but it hasn’t been all smooth sailing.   READ MORE: Md. Judge Denies Injunction Against Bank Of America In Lawsuit Over Coronavirus Small Business Stimulus Program   “There were a lot of challenges in its rollout,” Rosen said. “We’ve been helping clients through it.”   On top of it all, RS&F is still dealing with tax returns.   “We’re still keeping our foot down on the pedal in terms of getting regular tax filings done,” Rosen said. “In the case where people are getting refunds, they want them back.”   Amid the uncertainty, accounting firms are a lifeline for many small business owners.   “Right now, we are in a collective partnership — in the case of our clients, we tell them you never would have called your banker or your landlord or other vendor — you would never call them your partners, but in this environment, they’re your partners,” Rosen said.

‘It’s Pretty Terrifying’ | Maryland Woman Shares Experience Battling Coronavirus

For the thousands of people who’ve tested positive for coronavirus, many have are getting better, but they are still fighting lingering effects.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  For the thousands of people who’ve tested positive for coronavirus, many have are getting better, but they are still fighting lingering effects.  On March 15, when Maryland only had 37 confirmed cases of coronavirus, Cara Ober started to feel a change.   “The first day I had a fever of a 102,” Ober said. “I called my doctor and said can I get tested and he said no.”   At the time, Ober only had one symptom and tests were scare, but the country was on the verge of an unexpected wave.   Since then, she’s one of almost 10,000 Marylanders who’ve tested positive, and she doesn’t know where she got it.   “There was one day when I felt a little bit better,” Ober said. “The thing that’s very weird about COVID-19 is that one day you think you are on the mend and the very next day you’re worse.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     She ended up in the hospital, doctors were blunt, her lungs looked bad.   When she finally made it out, her worries switched to her husband who was taking care of her, and any family members who came into contact with her.   It appears everyone is now in the clear.   “It’s pretty terrifying,” Ober added. “The fever is pretty intense. I usually don’t get any kind of fever, your body really hurts.”   Ober is back home, but she told WJZ she’s still on the phone with doctors because there are lingering chest issues.

7-Year-Old Maryland Boy Is Delivering Care Packages To The Elderly Shut In By Coronavirus
.W
At a time when senior citizens must stay in to avoid the coronavirus, the spirited boy in Gaithersburg, Maryland, decided to make them care packages.

(WJZ/CNN) —  Cavanaugh Bell is a 7-year-old on a mission: “To help other people and let them know that I got their back,” he told CNN.  At a time when senior citizens must stay in to avoid the coronavirus, the spirited boy in Gaithersburg, Maryland, decided to make them care packages.   “The packages include toilet paper, some flushable wipes, hygiene products and a bunch of food,” he said.   ‘She’s my best friend’   The idea came when Bell realized his 74-year-old grandmother is in a  high-risk age group for coronavirus.   “One day I was thinking about my grandma and I was like ‘Oh, mommy she shouldn’t be going out to the grocery store because it’s coronavirus season. She’s my best friend.’ ”   After helping his grandma, the boy with the big smile and bigger heart looked at his grandmother’s neighbors at her senior citizen home — and worried.   “He was so heartbroken that he didn’t have enough to give to everyone,” Llacey Simmons, Bell’s mom, told CNN.   So Bell used $600 he’d saved up to fund his first batch of care packages.   “I asked him how much money he wanted to use from his savings– $50 or $100? He’s like ‘let’s use all of it.’ ”   Bell assembled more than 100 care packages and hot meals to deliver.   “We got stacks … we got hygeine products, and we got toilet paper,” Bell said.   The community joins in   When news spread of the first-grader’s good deed, donations began to roll in. He has since started an online campaign to get through what he calls the “coronapocalypse.”   It’s become more of a community project that way. But only Bell and his mother make the deliveries.   “We aren’t allowed to gather in large groups,” the supportive mom shared.   And with an overflow of donations, Simmons and Bell have created a community care pantry in Gaithersburg.   “Hopefully we can help a thousand people. We plan to do this until we run out of donations or until the pandemic is over,” Simmons said,   “It makes me feel beautiful inside because I like giving back,” Bell said.   If you would like to contribute to Bell’s community care pantry, you can donate to his  GoFundMe account.  He has also set up a website with more information  here .   And every dollar counts.   “I’m only getting $10 in allowance every week, so I need your help to donate because I’m still taking donations,” he said.

Coronavirus Cases: Johns Hopkins Doctor Back Fighting COVID-19 After Recovering From Virus

A Baltimore pediatrician is back at work treating coronavirus patients after beating the virus herself.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A Baltimore pediatrician is back at work treating coronavirus patients after beating the virus herself.  Dr. Sapna Kudchadkar, a pediatrician and anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said she is fortunate to have her health   “It feels really really good to be back and make a difference,” Kudchadkar said.   She spoke to WJZ’s Rachael Cardin Tuesday, via Zoom, explaining her journey and why staying home is so important.     Dr. Kudchadkar says during her fight with the  #coronavirus  she had muscle aches and a slight fever but serious issues breathing as well as major fatigue on some days.  @wjz  her story tonight at 5&6!  pic.twitter.com/C0wOt4Rf0O   — Rachael Cardin (@RachaelCardin)  April 14, 2020     “What I tell all of these people, staying home being in quarantine; it may feel like you’re not doing much but that’s everything,” she said. Flattening the curve is the goal for all healthcare workers, she said.   On March 21, Dr. Kudchadkar found out a colleague tested positive for the coronavirus and she knew she had to quarantine for 14 days. At first, she just had muscle aches and did not think much of it, but soon after she developed a cough and fatigue.

She also remembers having loss of smell and taste.   The virus ran its course and Dr. Kudchadkar said the hardest part was being away from her family, and especially her children over that two-week period.

Now back at work and fully equipped with PPE and a decorative home-made mask, Dr. Kudchadkar said she can use her experience to help others struggling with the virus.   “I feel like it’s a little bit of solidarity, I understand what they went through. Obviously, they have much more severe disease than I did, but there’s now a sense of bonding with these patients,” said Dr. Kudchadkar.   One blessing for Kudchadkar is children are not as seriously affected by COVID 19, which is why she has been moved to treat positive patients who need all the help they can get right now.   “I can’t emphasize enough, by staying home you’re doing everything you can that helps us,” said Dr. Kudchadkar.

Anyone who violates this order could be fined up to $500, officials said, and businesses who violate the new policy could be shut down.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Starting Wednesday, all retail shoppers and employees in Anne Arundel County will be required to wear face coverings in stores.  “Our most effective tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is for each of us to act as though we are carriers of the virus, because we could be,” said County Executive Steuart Pittman. “Face coverings in retail businesses by both shoppers and staff will save lives. I fully support (county health officer) Dr. (Nilesh) Kalyanaraman’s decision to require this protection.”   The order does not apply to children under two years old or those who could not wear a mask without inhibiting their own health.   Face coverings may be made out of cloth and don’t have to be surgical-grade masks such as N95 masks, which officials said should be for health workers.   “Masks protect you and those around you,” Kalyanaraman, who signed the order Tuesday morning, said. “It’s an important way each of us can slow the spread of the virus.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The order also requires retail businesses allowed open as essential to limit customer capacity to 50 percent of the normal capacity, maintain six feet between customers at checkout lines, make aisles one-way whenever possible, clearly mark social distancing restrictions, discontinue all self-service food counters, install physical barriers between cashiers and customers and provide access to sanitary restrooms and soap or hand sanitizer for customers and workers.   Anyone who violates this order could be fined up to $500, officials said, and businesses who violate the new policy could be shut down.   Other local jurisdictions have implemented this policy or are looking into doing so,  including Baltimore City,  whose city council is asking Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young to issue an executive order requiring everyone in the city to wear masks or face coverings while out in public   Montgomery County and Prince George’s County made it mandatory  over the weekend.

Coronavirus Latest: Maryland Schools Narrow Down Plans For Distance Learning, No Decision Made On School Closures

Maryland school officials are asking local districts to finalize their plans for distance learning as they wait to make a decision about schools closing through the academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland school officials are asking local districts to finalize their plans for distance learning as they wait to make a decision about schools closing through the academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  They did not make any official decisions about schools closing on the teleconference Tuesday.   Maryland schools will receive $207 million from the U.S. Department of Education to help pay for expenses and programs during the pandemic.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus List: Top 20 Zip Code In Maryland Reporting COVID-19 Cases   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     State school superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon said 90% of the money will be used to pay for expenses schools have incurred since March 13, 2020, when schools closed in the state.   The state will work with local school systems to make sure funds are dispersed as needed.   “To ensure we have a level of consistency in the continuity of plans for each local school system” their plans must be submitted for approval,” she said. “That [plan] must include their distance learning platform, the technology they have available and how the students who don’t have access to the device or the internet” will learn.   The plans will also describe the roles and responsibilities of school administrators, instructional assistants, students, and parents.   “They have to include a sample teacher and student day, a plan of accountability is to be included and should identify how they will monitor and access student performance,” Salmon added.   They must also describe how their school system plans to address equity, including special education, English learners, homeless students, students with academic needs and gifted students. They must also determine how teachers and staff will continue professional development and what resources will be available to students and teachers.   The school district has laid out some overall guidance and plans on their website along with some tips on how to help students in rural or low-income communities access the internet.   For example, in Cecil County, they are buying TMobile hotspots and putting them on buses. They are then driving the buses into areas with limited coverage.   Some school systems are sending packages with postage paid so they can be returned to teachers, the state said. Others are allowing students to park outside the schools and use that as a hotspot.   Schools also reviewed how they will handle things like graduation credits, attendance and more and put that in an FAQ on the state  schools’ website.    Maryland   Also, schools will continue to provide meals to students in the interim. Salmon said hundreds of thousands of meals have been served to children so far.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Safe Streets Baltimore Working To Help Inform City Residents About Coronavirus Safety
.W
A Baltimore city group that normally works to quell violence around the city is now shifting their focus to educating those same neighbors about coronavirus.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A Baltimore city group that normally works to quell violence around the city is now shifting their focus to educating those same neighbors about coronavirus.  Safe Streets Baltimore , which was founded in 2007, spent Tuesday walking around the Park Heights neighborhood to educate residents about the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and staying home.  Park Heights is among the zip code 21215  with the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state.   Rashad Singletary is the Manager for Safe Streets Baltimore. They promote public health and safe distancing during these challenging times.   He walks up to WJZ with a mask on, and does an elbow bump with photojournalist, Eric Dolezar before he steps behind the microphone for an interview.   Singletary is still pushing his stop the violence message and sharing a new one to hopefully stop the spread of coronavirus.     GOOD NEWS:  @SafeStreetsBalt  is out in Park Heights walking to anybody they can find to promote public health, safe distancing and staying home. “This is the most rewarding job I’ve ever had.”  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/3DLStmR05Q   — Max McGee (@MaxMcGeeTV)  April 14, 2020     “We want to make sure while the pandemic is active in our community, that we have individuals who can come into our area that help diffuse any type of violence,” he says.   Before walking throughout the neighborhood, he glances at the people sitting too close to each other at the bus stop.   “We’re trying to stop THAT,” he says with a furrowed brow.   “We’re maintaining our social distancing to make sure we don’t get infected or we infect someone else in case somebody does have it. What we’re doing is canvassing the hot spots in our community, or our target area.”   As the group of five walks along Belvedere Avenue, they walk side by side knowing there’s much more work to be done, but it’s a challenge they’re willing to take on.   Jarma Henson is also in the group.   “We just try to go out and deal with different ways of dealing with violence and let them know you don’t always have to deal with situations with violence.”   Another team on the front lines when Baltimore needs it now more than ever.

Coronavirus Latest: Baltimore Has Seen Progress In Flattening Curve, But Mayor Says ‘This Is No Time To Let Up’

Baltimore's efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus appear to be working, but the city shouldn't get complacent, Mayor Bernard C. "Jack" Young stressed Tuesday.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore’s efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus appear to be working, but the city shouldn’t get complacent, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young stressed Tuesday.  During a press conference Tuesday afternoon at City Hall, Young said there has been a 51 percent increase in cases in the city since April 9. Twenty-nine people have died and 217 have been hospitalized.   Despite the increase, Young said the city has been working hard to keep the number of COVID-19 cases low.   “Baltimore, we have seen progress in flattening the curve, but this is no time to rest or let up,” he said. “Everyone needs to stay home unless you are going out for an essential reason. Every time you leave your house, you put yourself and everyone in your household at risk.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     City officials continue to stress the importance of social distancing efforts in slowing the spread of the virus.   Monday night, the city council urged Young to implement an executive order requiring everyone to wear masks in public. At the news conference, Young said city leaders are still discussing such a proposal but have not made any final decisions.   READ MORE: Coronavirus Response: Baltimore City Council Favors Requiring Everyone To Wear Masks In Public   The mayor added the measure will likely include language about face coverings in addition to masks since not everyone can afford to purchase masks.   Young expects the city to make a decision about the plan by the end of the week.   Several other jurisdictions, including  Anne Arundel ,  Montgomery  and Prince George’s counties, have put similar orders in place.   READ MORE: Coronavirus Latest: Anne Arundel County Requiring All Shoppers, Employees To Wear Face Masks To Prevent COVID-19 Spread   When it comes to whether people would follow the face covering rule, Young said it’s up to individuals to heed the warnings from officials.   “As much as we want people to abide by what we’re telling them … we can only tell people; there’s no ‘stick’ to make them do it,” he said.   Last Friday , the city opened a drive-through testing site at Pimlico Race Course. On the first day it was open, workers tested 96 people, city health commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said.   Testing was suspended on Monday due to severe weather, and 115 more people are scheduled to be tested on Tuesday, she added.   The site is still operating on an appointment-only model and patients must have a referral to make an appointment.   When it comes to opening future testing sites, Dzirasa said the city is using recently-released demographic and racial data to determine where the next sites should be, adding officials have scouted sites in both west and east Baltimore.

Coronavirus Response: Appeals Court Judge Orders Courts To Identify Offenders At High Risk Of COVID-19 For Possible Release

Maryland's top appeals court judge has issued an order encouraging lower courts to identify offenders who are at high risk for contracting coronavirus for possible release.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Maryland’s top appeals court judge has issued an order encouraging lower courts to identify offenders who are at high risk for contracting coronavirus for possible release.  In an order Tuesday , Judge Mary Ellen Barbera said lower courts should identify the high-risk offenders in order to protect the inmate population as a whole.   Before releasing an offender, the courts should consider whether that person is a threat to the community, whether the facility they’re being held at can address coronavirus-related medical issues and whether the person shows any symptoms of the virus, the order reads.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  There are now more than 9,000 coronavirus cases and 300 deaths in Maryland, according to new data released Tuesday morning.  The state health department reports at least 9,472 cases of COVID-19 in the state and 302 deaths. That’s an increase for 536 cases in just one day. It also marked the deadliest day for the state since the coronavirus pandemic began.

Coronavirus Outbreak Caused Explosion Of On-Demand Exercise Classes — And It May Stay That Way For Good
.W
As the coronavirus pandemic limits social contact with others, hundreds of gyms and studios have partnered with a Pikesville, Maryland-based company to get their workouts online.

PIKESVILLE, Md. (CBS Local)  — As the coronavirus pandemic limits social contact with others, gyms and exercise studios have been forced to close, leaving members looking for alternative ways to get in their regular workouts. Thankfully, social media and live video technology is allowing trainers to stay close to members from a distance and give individuals ideas for at-home workouts.  In Edina, Minnesota,  Barre3 studio  is offering classes in real time on Instagram Live. Now their $24 classes are free of charge to anyone in need. “It wouldn’t feel right to exclude these live classes from anyone and everyone who wants to join in on them,” co-owner Lucy Gardiner told CBS Minnesota.   Similarly, Chris Vlaun, co-founder of  V. Art of Wellness  based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, teaches a free, 10-minute, full-body workout on his Instagram page. If you do three rounds of it, you can extend your workouts to 30 minutes. “Ten minutes on Instagram is way to connect with people,” he told CBS Miami. “It’s a quick warm up and then intensified. It’s a full-body experience and there is no equipment necessary.”   At Local Motion  Fitness in Pittsburgh , owner Laura Fonzi has created an exercise  class  for kids everyday on her Facebook page,  Local Motion PGH . “As a mom of four, I know our kids need exercise for their mental health now that their schedules are disrupted,”  she told CBS PIttsburgh .   One company in particular is bringing a wide range of health clubs from around the country to its members, giving new meaning to the term “group fitness.” Hundreds of gyms and studios have partnered with Pikesville, Maryland-based  BurnAlong  to get their workouts online and give Americans the ability to work out in real-time along with trainers and gym rats near and far.   BurnAlong helps people stay healthy and engaged with their favorite instructor from home. The online fitness and wellbeing platform brings exercise, yoga, meditation, and other health-centric classes to digital devices, partnering with fitness clubs and trainers to allow members the opportunity to get their fix anywhere, anytime. Over the past month, more than 150 new gyms and studios have signed up with BurnAlong, Co-Chief Executive Daniel Freedman told CBS Local.   “It’s clear people are feeling both the stress of being stuck at home and the concern for jobs, economy, and their health — and are gravitating towards emotional health classes along with classes for their physical health, and taking classes live with others for social support,” he said.   Freedman says because of the restraints of social distancing, a record number of companies are signing up for their employees. “Employers and insurers are understanding that they have a responsibility to support employees during this difficult time by both delivering to them the physical and emotional health classes they need, and, importantly, their families need too,” he said.     Great way for family to start day – live class from  @MonteSanders  on  @BurnAlong  .  (1,000s of classes, 45+ categories, 100s of local instructors.) Keep healthy, keep positive, keep active – so impt during these times.  #fitness   #Health   #exercise   #Motivation   #coronavirus   #wellness   pic.twitter.com/Alyq0ZhpOr   — Daniel Freedman (@dfreed1)  March 20, 2020         The number of classes taken by BurnAlong members has grown seven-fold since March, and more than 25 percent of the classes taken fall into the specialty and emotional support categories.  The increase cuts across all age groups, ranging from 6 weeks — with parents in particular rushing to fill time in “Mommy and Me” classes — to those in their 90s. In fact, the oldest active member is 97 years old.   Freedman said members are especially spending more time tending to their mental health these days. The number of yoga and meditation classes taken has doubled since the beginning of the nationwide stay-at-home recommendations. “We are living in a time of lots of unknowns and that’s scary. Yoga, mindfulness, and meditation helps put those out of the mind and lets people relax,” he said.   For people who do prefer to exercise in a live group setting, BurnAlong includes a class where members can invite up to three friends, family members or co-workers to take group classes together in real time where they can see and hear each other.   “When we ask people what they love most about BurnAlong that’s keeping them so engaged, they say it’s the range of programming – classes for the whole family – and critically the social component, of being able to take classes live online in private sessions with friends, family members, co-workers you see,” said Freedman. “People are craving social support now more than ever.”   Looking ahead into what life will be like once the outbreak ends and life resumes for Americans, Freedman believes that health clubs will need to adapt to the fact that people will be more prone to working out from home. Whether it’s because we’ve simply grown used to this new normal, or because people will feel safer and healthier at home, the need on-demand fitness likely won’t fade. “Post-COVID, with fitness as with work, I think we will see more of a hybrid model. People will be more comfortable than before exercising from home, but will still crave in-person experiences,” he said. “So the key for brick and mortar is to make sure people can easily transition between online and in-person, similar to the sports and music industries.”   As for some other online exercise options:   Amy Segal is a Miami-based flywheel  fitness  trainer under her Instagram name  @Spinmoma  or #amyspin. These days Segal is burning calories and having loads fun off the bike from outside her home with as many  fitness  friends and fans as she can fit on her daily free Zoom  classes .   You can channel your inner prima ballerina with Miami City Ballet star Jennifer Lauren, who, along with two other dancers, is offering free ballet  classes  on MCB’s Instagram  @miamicityballet .  Classes  are offered on Saturdays, Mondays and Thursdays, and teachers are available for private lessons as well.   Dennis Dumas Jr., owner of  Omni Fight Club  in Livermore, California, is now live streaming his  fitness   classes . He says it’s a little bit gritty from his home garage, but he invites anyone to join in.Anyone looking to join just needs log on to  Omni Fight Club Livermore Facebook page  and  fitness  comes alive, from his garage to yours.   And finally, from the heart of the Big Apple in Manhattan, is Barry’s  Fitness  chief instructor  Keoni Hudoba , who is teaching a daily 30-minute, full-body workout on his Instagram live for free. If you miss his 9 a.m.  class , you can find it archived on his Instagram (IGTV) videos.  Thousands of followers sweat along with him daily.

Sharing Senior Photos On Social Media Enables Data Mining, Better Business Bureau Warns

A tribute to high school seniors who are missing the traditional send-offs due to coronavirus shelter-in-place orders has set off alarm bells from the Better Business Bureau.

(CBS Local)  — A tribute to high school seniors who are missing the traditional send-offs due to coronavirus shelter-in-place orders has set off alarm bells from the Better Business Bureau.  People who wanted to show support for this year’s class of graduates of all ages recently began  participating  in the #Classof2020 Facebook challenge, sharing photos of their senior year with their high school name and graduation year.   But the  BBB  says scammers can use that information to answer common online security questions.   “All it takes is an internet search to reveal more information about you, such as family members, your real name, birthdate or even where you live,” the BBB warned in  blog post  on Monday.     Better Business Bureau warns against sharing senior photos on social media  https://t.co/rFkziRIdSh   — CBS_42 (@CBS_42)  April 15, 2020     The BBB cautions everyone to be aware of what they are sharing on social media during this time of self-quarantine and isolation. Other recent viral personal list posts include all the cars you’ve owned (including makes/model years), favorite athletes, and top 10 favorite television shows.   “What most people forget is that some of these ‘favorite things’ are commonly used passwords or security questions,” the BBB said. “If your social media privacy settings aren’t high, you could be giving valuable information away for anyone to use.   The BBB urges consumers to follow these  tips  to stay safe on social media:     Resist the temptation to play along. While it’s fun to see other’s posts, if you are uncomfortable participating, it is best to not do it.   Review your security settings. Check your security settings on all social media platforms to see what you are sharing and with whom you are sharing.   Change security questions/settings. If you are nervous about something you shared possibly opening you up to fraud, review and change your security settings for banking and other websites.

CBS Sports And NFL Team Up To Re-Air Classic NFL On CBS Games, Including Ravens
.W
Leading into the NFL Draft, CBS Sports joins with the NFL to re-broadcast 15 recent NFL games including two Tom Brady-Peyton Manning matchups.

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —  The NFL Draft, scheduled for April 23-25, is barely more than a week away. And for the sports-deprived fan, it can’t come fast enough. The world remains in full-on lock-down mode thanks to coronavirus. Basketball and hockey are on seemingly permanent pause. Baseball never really started. Football fans can’t even follow the  XFL , which played half a season 19 years after its first and disappeared again like some sort of sports league cicada.  The three-day NFL Draft is probably the closest to live sports we’re going to get for awhile. Or maybe not…   CBS Sports, in partnership with the NFL, has updated its schedule to broadcast 15 of this century’s classic NFL games leading into next week’s Draft. Among them are Super Bowls, Championships and regular season games, featuring some of the game’s greats and bright young stars. See Tom Brady take on Peyton Manning and Patrick Mahomes face down Lamar Jackson.   The re-airings are scheduled to start Thursday, April 16 on CBS Sports Network with the 2019 Week 3 matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes got the better of Jackson that wet afternoon, as the Ravens eked out a 33-28 win. The re-broadcasts will continue through the weekend when Manning leads his Indianapolis Colts past Brady’s New England Patriots in the 2006 AFC Championship and into Super Bowl XLI and then does it again with the Denver Broncos in the 2015 AFC Championship for a trip to Super Bowl 50. The classic games conclude the following Wednesday night with the Chiefs’ Championship win over the Tennessee Titans earlier this year.   The CBS and CBS Sports Network re-broadcasts aim to increase awareness for COVID-19 relief efforts. The week-long lineup will also help promote the NFL’s “Draft-A-Thon” — a three-day virtual fundraiser coinciding with the NFL Draft to support charities helping to battle the spread of COVID-19. Those charities include  American Red Cross ,  CDC Foundation ‘s All of Us: Combat Coronavirus Campaign and  Feeding America ‘s COVID-19 Response Fund.   The full schedule of classic NFL re-broadcasts on CBS and CBS Sports Network is below:   Thursday, April 16 – NFL’s Next Generation of Young Stars Shine Bright     2019 Week 3 (Sept. 22, 2019): Baltimore Ravens vs. Kansas City Chiefs (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   2019 Week 4 (Sept. 29, 2019): Cleveland Browns vs. Baltimore Ravens (10:00-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Friday, April 17 – Iconic Game Forever Remembered     2009 AFC Championship (Jan. 24, 2010): New York Jets vs. Indianapolis Colts (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   2001 AFC Divisional Playoff (Jan. 19, 2002): Oakland Raiders vs. New England Patriots (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Saturday, April 18 – Mahomes and Chiefs Come Back; Tebow and Broncos Win Shocker     2018 AFC Championship (Jan. 20, 2019): New England Patriots vs. Kansas City Chiefs (1:00-3:00 pm ET) (CBS)   2019 AFC Divisional Playoff (Jan. 12, 2020): Houston Texans vs. Kansas City Chiefs (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   2011 AFC Wild Card (Jan. 8, 2012): Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Denver Broncos (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Sunday, April 19 – AFC Championship Game: Brady-Manning II & IV     2006 AFC Championship (Jan. 21, 2007): New England Patriots vs. Indianapolis Colts (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   2015 AFC Championship (Jan. 24, 2016): Denver Broncos vs. New England Patriots (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Monday, April 20 – Tom Brady on His Way to Super Bowl XXXVIII and Becoming the G.O.A.T.     2003 AFC Championship (Jan. 18, 2004): Indianapolis Colts vs. New England Patriots (8:00-10:00 PM, ET) (CBS Sports Network)   Super Bowl XXXVIII (Feb. 1, 2004 in Houston): Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Tuesday, April 21 – Two for Tuesday Highlights Peyton Manning’s Super Bowl Wins     Super Bowl XLI (Feb. 4, 2007 in Miami): Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears: (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   Super Bowl 50 (Feb. 7, 2016 in Santa Clara, Calif.): Carolina Panthers vs. Denver Broncos (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)     Wednesday, April 22 – Changing of the Guard as Mahomes Learns from Losing and Wins     2018 AFC Championship (Jan. 20, 2019): New England Patriots vs. Kansas City Chiefs (8:00-10:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)   2019 AFC Championship (Jan. 19, 2020): Tennessee Titans vs. Kansas City Chiefs (10:00 PM-12:00 pm ET) (CBS Sports Network)

‘I’m Going In’: Mom Wears Buzz Lightyear Toy Helmet To Shop At Grocery Store

A North Carolina mom who didn't have a mask decided to get creative before venturing out for an essential errand during coronavirus shelter-in-place orders.

STALLINGS, N.C. (CBS Local)  — A North Carolina mom who didn’t have a mask decided to get creative before venturing out for an essential errand during coronavirus shelter-in-place orders.  Kelly Hogan Painter said her husband told her that she shouldn’t go to the store to buy her family food without a mask. But with no mask in the house, she grabbed the next best thing — a Buzz Lightyear toy helmet, complete with sounds and a button that closes the plastic face guard.   Painter videotaped herself as headed into a Stallings grocery store…and beyond!     “So when your husband bets you…. Well first he tells you that you can’t go to the store without a mask, and then you tell him that it was recommended and not necessary, and then he tells you you can’t go get food for your kids because we have no mask in the house…. So you supply the mask,” says Painter, pushing the button to lower the helmet’s face mask. “I’m going in.”   At least one person  reportedly  approached Painter, asking if they could take a picture of her.   Painter shared the video April 4 on Facebook.   “If y’all see me on the news tonight PLEASE don’t tell my mama. She would be so embarrassed,” she joked in the post. “Y’all stay safe!”

What Some Employees, Shoppers Are Saying About Executive Order Requiring Face Coverings In All Maryland Businesses
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Wednesday that will require all Marylanders to wear face coverings while in stores and on public transportation to limit the spread of COVID-19.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Wednesday that will require all Marylanders to wear face coverings while in stores and on public transportation to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The order will go into effect on Saturday at 7 a.m., the governor said.   In Anne Arundel County, an order requiring employees and shoppers to wear face coverings while in stores went into effect Wednesday.   Xama Patel works at Pops Grocery and Deli in Glen Burnie.   “We just told them, ‘Hey, please come back with your mask on.’ As of right now, we haven’t had any problems with anyone,” Patel said.   The store is run by her father, and Patel said she worries about his health.   “Knowing that they could catch the virus and something could go wrong, it’s very scary,” Patel said. “So when they came up with the regulations and rules, we just want to follow it.”   Nilesh Kalyanaraman, Health Officer for Anne Arundel County said, the executive order is important to limit the spread of COVID-19.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “The reason we are doing this is really to make sure those businesses can safely serve those customers, that’s the foremost goal.” Kalyanaraman said. “If someone is caught without a mask, they will be approached with a conversation first. It’s more about what is the right thing to do then we want to fine people or penalize people, that’s not the spirit of this. The spirit is to keep people safe.”   Shopper Robert Smith said he will do whatever it takes to keep his family safe.   “I’m with whatever will keep us healthy, especially like my parents,” Smith said. “I’m wondering when this will all be over. I never thought I would be seeing a time like this it. It seems like the whole world came to a stop.”   Dr. Chirag Chaudhari, with the Baltimore Washington Medical Center, said just covering your nose and mouth is not enough.   ”The front of the mask theoretically is where it’s dirty. You want to make sure you grab it from the straps when you’re putting it on or taking it off and immediately afterwards do a thorough hand-wash to keep yourself clean.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Dr. Anthony Fauci On Baseball Returning This Summer: ‘There’s A Way Of Doing That’
.W
The coronavirus pandemic has forced all sports into indefinite hiatus, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious diseases expert, sees a path back.

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —  Quarantine may be the best opportunity people will ever have to catch up on all those television shows they’ve missed. However, it’s the worst time to be a sports fan. With coronavirus and the subsequent social distancing, all in-season sports have gone on hiatus. All out-of-season sports — namely football — have gone remote for all off-season activities.  MLB is exploring options for a properly distanced baseball, for which teams, umpires and relevant staff would isolate themselves, perhaps in Arizona, for a shortened, fan-free regular season. The NFL is still planning for a 16-game regular season in the fall. But is there a way to be safe and still play ball?   Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the country’s top infectious disease expert, believes there is. When asked by Snapchat’s Peter Hamby about the chances of baseball resuming this summer and college football and the pro football following in August, Fauci seemed open to the possibility.   “There’s a way of doing that,” Fauci said. “Nobody comes to the stadium. Put [players and coaches] in big hotels, wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled. But have them tested like every week and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.”   Fauci has more pressing matters to attend to, with the country in the throes of the worst pandemic its seen in generations. However he did admit to missing baseball.   “I mean, people say, well you can’t play without spectators. Well, I think you’ll probably get enough buy-in from people who are dying to see a baseball game. Particularly me,” Dr. Fauci said. “I’m living in Washington, we have the world-champion Washington Nationals, you know? I want to see them play again.”   MLB’s reported plan, still in the formulation process, would both keep out fans and protect the health of all involved. Arizona’s governor Doug Ducey would  support hosting games . As Ducey said, “I just want everyone to know that Arizona, at the right time, is very open-minded to hosting whatever Major League Baseball would like from the state, at the time that it would be appropriate for public health if Arizona were in a position to reopen.”

The grants will help small businesses and manufacturers off-set costs as they modify their equipment, buy raw materials and pay their employees to provide PPE.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Some local businesses are receiving grants from a newly created fund by the city to produce personal protective equipment, or PPE, as demand rises amid the coronavirus pandemic.  The Personal Protective Equipment Manufacturing Fund is possible in partnership with the city and the Baltimore Development Corporation.   The list of businesses as well as what they produce are as follows:     •  SewLab USA  (face masks)   •  Quality Mask Supply  (face masks)   •  Custom 3D Stuff  (face shields)   •  Maryland Thermoform  (face shields)   •  Wills Printing Co.

(hand sanitizer)   •  Louthan Distilling  (hand sanitizer)   •  Different Regard  (gowns/hazmat suits)   •  Citywide Youth Development  (gowns/hazmat suits)     “First responders and healthcare workers are risking their health every day, and it’s never been more important to ensure they have the necessary equipment to protect themselves,” said Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young.  “This small infusion of capital will enable these businesses to scale up production of crucial Personal Protective Equipment to help keep essential workers safer.”   The grants will help small businesses and manufacturers off-set costs as they modify their equipment, buy raw materials and pay their employees to provide PPE.

Gov. Larry Hogan began talking about a plan to slowly reopen Maryland as the state reels from the coronavirus pandemic, but he urged caution.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan began talking about a plan to slowly reopen Maryland as the state reels from the coronavirus pandemic, but he urged caution.  Gov. Hogan said at a press conference Wednesday:   “The worst possible thing we could do is to take action too quickly and then have that spike so we look like New York—and we have thousands of people die and hundreds of thousands of people sick and we overload our hospital system because then it’s very hard to get that genie back in the bottle. It is too soon to say we’re going to start opening everything. We’re not going to flip a light switch. But it’s not too soon to start laying out what that would look like and maybe start considering when the first steps might take place.”     Hogan: We are seeing signs of cautious optimism. Gov says they are developing “roadmap to recovery”  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/mQ6zZlX52c   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  April 15, 2020     Hogan said a successful recovery will need expanded testing, more personal protective equipment, available surge hospital beds and better tracking of those who have tested positive.     Hogan says recent hospitalization rates are showing signs of stabilizing  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/CwV4l5ZNq0   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  April 15, 2020     Gov. Hogan announced that over the last several weeks, state officials have been consulting with doctors and public health experts serving on the Coronavirus Response Team to develop a roadmap for the reopening of Maryland and the state economy.   “Fortunately, because of the early and aggressive actions and because of the extraordinary sacrifices of Marylanders, we are now in a position to move from containment and mitigation to planning the gradual rollout of our recovery phase. There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now and there is clearly a light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us. Right now while our numbers are still climbing and we are still heading up that curve, not down, it is absolutely critical for Marylanders to stay home, to continue avoiding crowds and gatherings, and to aggressively practice social distancing.”   Gov. Hogan laid out four building blocks for a recovery plan:     Expanding testing capacity   Increasing hospital surge capacity   Ramping up supply of PPE   Building a robust contact tracing operation     The number of state workers handling Maryland’s contact tracing operation will quadruple—from 250 to 1,000. Those health investigators look into anyone exposed to a COVID-19 patient.   “We will need to ramp up considerably to reach every single COVID-positive patient in the state, and that is the goal to suppress this virus,” said Maryland’s Deputy Health Secretary Fran Phillips.       For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Latest: Muslim Health Care Worker Tasered By L.A. Mart Guard For Not Removing Face Covering, CAIR Says

CAIR is asking the Howard County Police to investigate the circumstances that led to a store security guard at L.A. Mart to Taser a man who wore a face covering while shopping for groceries earlier this month.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  CAIR is asking the Howard County Police to investigate the circumstances that led to a store security guard at L.A. Mart to Taser a man who wore a face covering while shopping for groceries earlier this month.  According to The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the man of Tunisian heritage is a healthcare worker who worked with COVID-19 positive patients.   When he entered the store on April 4, a security guard approached him and asked him to remove his face covering. The shopper removed the face covering to show the guard who he was, a regular customer that’s known to the store, then replaced the mask. He also asked the guard to move back so they could follow social distancing guidelines, CAIR says.

The shopper declined saying he had the right to protect himself and other shoppers and proceeding to continue to get groceries.   When the man got to the checkout counter to pay for his items, the security guard again allegedly confronted him and Tasered him as the man stepped away to leave.   When the shopper fell down in shock and pain, the guard allegedly pinned him down and restrained him and then escorted him to an enclosed office space.   Police were called as well as the paramedics and the man was evaluated and cleared for release.   “This individual is a hero providing an essential service during this pandemic, yet he was disrespected, attacked and humiliated as if he were a criminal. This ordeal has traumatized him and has had a profound effect on his wife and children,” said CAIR’s Director of Maryland Outreach Zainab Chaudry. “His experience underscores why too many people of color are uncomfortable or reluctant to wear personal protective gear like face masks in public for fear of being profiled and attacked. We urge law enforcement to promptly investigate the circumstances of this incident, restore some measure of dignity, and help deliver justice for him and his family.”   “This incident is carved in my mind,” the shopper said in a statement provided by CAIR. “[I am] still waking up in the middle of the night with nightmares screaming and crying. My family noticed the change in my behavior also. My daughter and my son are still crying and my daughter was crying in my arms yesterday saying, ‘I want my Dad back’. All I want from this horrifying incident is justice for me and my family. All I want is that after me nobody and no human being should go through what I went through.”   CAIR notes that there have been other incidents where people have been harassed while wearing a face mask in public.   “Our client was violently attacked for simply trying to protect himself and the public from the coronavirus,” said Attorney David Muncy of Plaxen and Adler Law Firm, who is providing legal representation. “The actions of the L.A. Mart guard were reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. We will fight to obtain justice for him and his family and look forward to holding this company responsible for the harm they have caused.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Latest: 4 Recently-Admitted Jesuit Priests At Baltimore County Nursing Home Test Positive For COVID-19
.W
Four recently-admitted residents at a Baltimore County nursing home have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Tuesday.

TIMONIUM, Md. (WJZ) —  Four recently-admitted residents at a Baltimore County nursing home have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Tuesday.  All four people were admitted to Stella Maris in Timonium, a spokesperson for the facility said. They were all admitted “directly into a dedicated COVID-19 unit, which is separate from the rest of the building and has a dedicated staff of healthcare professionals,” the facility said in a statement.   The spokesperson did not provide further updates citing a policy to not discuss specific patients, but WJZ has learned all four are Jesuit priests who were evacuated from an infirmary in the Philadelphia area.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Rebecca Cook said her mother is a 93-year-old resident at Stella Maris and was shocked to hear the news.   “It’s unbelievable,” Cook said. “I don’t understand why they would do something like that.”   Cook said she got a letter from the facility. The letter said, over the weekend, the priests were treated as persons under investigation. They tested positive for coronavirus and were admitted to a designated COVID-19 unit.   In a statement to WJZ, the nursing home said they’re taking precautionary steps to stop the spread of the virus, like screening staff members upon entry, not allowing any visitors or non essential personal and cancelling all group activities within the facility.   Cook, however, said since there hadn’t been any positive cases on campus, she questions why the nursing facility brought them here in the first place.   “It’s one thing if they were in state, but these people are coming from Philadelphia, so they have places in Philadelphia,” Cook said. “They have hospitals, they have places set up to take people like this.”   John Schweitzer told WJZ his parents are in an independent living hall at Stella Maris. He said he’s upset by the decision the facility made.   “I already can’t see my parents,” he said. “They are 93. Now, they brought the disease to this building, and I don’t think it’s fair.”   The facility does have what’s called a Certificate of Need from Governor Larry Hogan’s office. It designates the facility to create an 18 bed unit for coronavirus patients – that includes residents that become sick or patients who were released from the hospital and need extra care.   Stella Maris said in a letter to family members that “the decision to accept the priest was not made lightly and is in keeping with our Mission to care for the sick and the elderly.”   One employee at Stella Maris, who did not want to be identified, said he’s comfortable with going to work.   “I think we are doing a great job,” the employee said. “We have really been trying to cut down on the people coming into the facility, which is good, and everybody who comes in has their temperature checked.”   Nursing homes have been hit especially hard in Maryland and elsewhere; 24 residents of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy have died and dozens more residents and staff members have tested positive.   There are confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 90 or more nursing home and long-term care facilities in the state, health officials said.   The significant spread of the virus within enclosed communities led Gov. Larry Hogan  to announce the creation of “strike teams”  to bolster facilities’ abilities to respond to the pandemic.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Signs Executive Order Requiring Face Coverings In All Maryland Businesses, Public Transit To Limit COVID-19 Spread
.W
The order will go into effect on Saturday at 7 a.m., the governor said.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan has signed an executive order that will require all Marylanders to wear face coverings while in stores and on public transportation to limit the spread of COVID-19, and gave an update on strike teams at Maryland facilities and PPE equipment in a press conference on Wednesday.  The order will go into effect on Saturday at 7 a.m., the governor said. All essential business workers must also require their staff to wear face coverings and put into place appropriate social distancing measures in order to keep the customers and their own employees safe.   This includes when people are dealing with Uber, Lyft drivers or delivery workers, all of whom must wear a face covering when near a customer.     Uber and Lyft drivers need to wear face coverings if customers are in the car. Delivery people need to wear face coverings when interacting with customers.   — Mike Ricci (@riccimike)  April 15, 2020     This comes just minutes after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young announced he signed an executive order advising Baltimore residents to wear face coverings out in public.   Other jurisdictions across the state have already made face masks mandatory, including Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County.   The governor said that according to early projections from Johns Hopkins, without the state taking the drastic actions they have already, the pandemic would infect nearly 360,000 in the state and potentially kill 12,000 Marylanders by June 1.   He said that at this point, the state’s hospitalization rates have started to show signs of stabilizing and they expect their testing capability to continue to ramp up, saying that they are on track to more than triple their current capacity to up to 10,000 tests a day.   “The state has recently secured an additional 40,000 tests, including 30,000 that will be utilized that will utilize the state’s new Abbott m 2000 testing machines,” He said.   These state tests will complement the testing that is happening in clinical facilities and private commercial labs across the state.   Maryland has also entered into a separate agreement with Abbott Labs to acquire a “substantial number” of antibody tests.   The governor said they are also ramping up their supply of PPE, headed by a multi-agency task force, and that they have received one million face shields and 1,000 ICU beds, and in the next week expect deliveries of 4.5 million additional N95 masks, 280 oxygen concentrators and 52 additional ICU ventilators.   In a move that was the first in the nation, there are now strike teams at 16 nursing homes and 15 group homes for medically fragile children.   And, in signs of what he’s calling cautious optimism, he said they are developing a roadmap for the reopening of the state- but clarified that wouldn’t necessarily be happening any time soon.   “Because if the recovery is not in a thoughtful and responsible way, it would not only cost lives, but it would deepen the economic crisis and actually prolong the problems and slow our economy,” Gov. Hogan said.   “There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now. And there is clearly a light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us right now while our numbers are still climbing. And while we’re still heading up that curve. Instead of down. It is absolutely critical for Marylanders to stay at home to continue avoiding crowds and gatherings, and to aggressively practice, social distancing.” He added.

Coronavirus Latest: 170 COVID-19 Cases Reported At FutureCare Lochearn In NW Baltimore
.W
There are 170 confirmed cases of coronavirus at the FutureCare senior care facility in Lochearn, which attributes to the 223 COVID-19 cases reported in the 21215 zip code.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  There are 170 confirmed cases of coronavirus at the FutureCare senior care facility in Lochearn, which attributes to the 223 COVID-19 cases reported in the 21215 zip code.  The 21215 zip code has the highest number of cases in Maryland.   Baltimore Mayor Jack Young said of the cases at the facility in the 4800 block of Seton Drive, 129 are residents and 41 are staff members.   “We were very concerned about that,” Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott said.   Scott added that he wants patients inside to know they’re working to keep them safe.   “We have to communicate with the population to make sure they know we’re keeping them informed and healthy and safe and alive,” Scott said. “Everybody has to be communicated with consistently, especially the most vulnerable.”   Coronavirus Latest: More Than 10K COVID-19 Cases Reported In Maryland, 349 Deaths On Record   FutureCare proactively implemented a process known as ‘widespread surveillance testing’ at that Lochearn site, which monitors the intensity and spread of the disease in a community with high transmission.     ZIP CODES WITH HIGHEST CASE COUNTS (1-5):   21215, Arlington, Baltimore/Baltimore City (223) 20904, Silver Spring, Montgomery (164) 20706, Lanham, Prince George's (162) 20906, Silver Spring, Montgomery (153) 20902, Silver Spring, Montgomery (147)   — Kata D. Hall (@katadhall)  April 15, 2020     “Many of the people who have tested positive are not symptomatic, but this proactive testing allows the medical staff to monitor, and also isolate positive patients,” the city said in a statement.   “The Baltimore City Health Department is aware of the confirmed COVID-19 cases at the FutureCare – Lochearn location, and is working diligently with FutureCare management,” Young said. “I have spoken with Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa, and will continue to monitor the situation at this facility.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus List: Top 20 Zip Code In Maryland Reporting COVID-19 Cases   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We will continue to provide additional support as needed to help FutureCare support its patients and staff,” Dr. Dzirasa said.   The Baltimore City Health Department is working closely with the Maryland Department of Health, LifeBridge Health, and Johns Hopkins to address the positive cases at the facility.   The following actions have taken place to slow the spread:     In conjunction with the Baltimore City Health Department, the Maryland Department of Health dispatched one of the State’s Strike Teams for Nursing Homes to the facility. The team is composed of members of the National Guard, representatives of local and state health departments, and EMS clinicians, as well as doctors and nurses from local hospital systems.   Baltimore City Health Department distributed personal protective equipment (PPE) from the Strategic National Stockpile and from the Maryland Department of Health’s PPE cache.   The State worked with the Baltimore City Health Department to conduct a site assessment, and helped coordinate efforts with LifeBridge Health and Johns Hopkins.   LifeBridge Health worked with FutureCare to test all of the residents and staff on site, and provided PPE.   LifeBridge sent a medical survey team to provide recommendations to FutureCare management and to assist in establishing medical protocols.     “Our Lochearn facility cares for an elderly population with underlying conditions in the highest COVID-19 impacted zip code in the city, 21215. Therefore, we sought to be the first company to proactively implement a process known as ‘widespread surveillance testing’,” FutureCare Spokeswoman Holly O’Shea said. “This testing monitors the intensity and spread of the disease in a community with high transmission, like zip code 21215.”   “Given this location is also a large facility, with 200 beds, we felt strongly that it was important to know who was carrying the virus, even if they didn’t present specific COVID-19 symptoms, to mitigate its spread and protect our staff and residents,” O’Shea continued. “In fact, most of our positives tested over the weekend presented no symptoms of any kind. This type of surveillance testing is unprecedented and can save lives.”   “FutureCare’s highest priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our staff and residents, and we will continue to work diligently with the state and local health departments, our LifeBridge health partners, and our Johns Hopkins infectious disease consultant, to protect our staff and residents,” she continued.”FutureCare has employed infection control procedures, and was an early adapter of visitation restriction, universal masking, and have implemented all of Governor Hogan’s orders.”   According to officials, all residents who tested negative for COVID-19 are being moved out of the facility.

Coronavirus Resources: How To Make Your Own Face Mask
.W
Not sure how to wear or clean the masks? We answer those questions under the mask-making instructions.

(CNN) —  There’s one thing you should know before diving into the  conversation around masks : The public should not purchase N95 respirators. Health care workers need those when they’re  treating coronavirus patients .  You should also note:     Face covering  is  recommended but not mandatory       Homemade masks are  not  a substitute for social distancing and staying in     Still, if you want to make a mask, here are step-by-step instructions — based on guidance from the  Vanderbilt University Medical Center  and  Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin .   Not sure how to wear or clean the masks? We answer those questions under the mask-making instructions.   Materials you’ll need      2 pieces of tight-weave cotton fabric, 9 x 6 inches (per mask)   4 strips of fabric, 2 x 16 inches (per mask)   Ruler   Sewing machine OR needle and thread   Pencil or marker   Scissors   A handful of sewing pins   Iron     Make your mask   1. Cut your fabric into two 9 x 6-inch rectangles. Place them on top of each other.   2. On the top of the 9-inch side, pin or mark a 2-inch opening in the center of the top edge of the 9-inch side, between the 3.5- and 5.5-inch points, along the top edge. Then, sew the edges on either side of where you pinned or marked the opening. You’ll need that 2-inch opening to turn the mask right side out.   3. Sew the other three sides of the mask shut, too.   4. Turn the mask right side out through the 2-inch opening you left on the top. Then, press the mask with an iron to get rid of wrinkles.   5. Line your ruler up vertically along the 6-inch side of the mask. Starting at the 1.5-inch line, pin where you’ll sew your pleats down the side. These pleats help the mask stretch.   Pin again at the 2-, 3-, 3.5-, 4.5- and 5-inch lines.   6. Bring the pin at the 1.5-inch line down to the 2-inch line, and voila, you’ve made a pleat! Repeat with the 3-inch to the 3.5-inch and the 4.5-inch to the 5-inch line. Pin your new pleats, and repeat on the other side.   7. Sew the sides of your mask up so the pleats are laid flat.   Make mask ties   1. Cut four strips of fabric, 2 inches wide by 16 inches long.   2. Fold them in half lengthwise.   3. Turn them under 1/4-inch on the long side.   4. Iron them in place, then stitch the long side shut.   5. Pin each tie to a corner of the mask.   6. Sew around the perimeter of the mask once more so the ties are attached — and now you’ve completed your mask.     Mask FAQs   How do I wear it?    Masks are only effective if you wear them properly. The  World Health Organization  has the how-to:     Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water before touching or putting on the mask.   Make sure your entire nose and mouth are covered when you put it on.   Avoid touching the mask while you’re out — this can contaminate it.   Do not take the mask off while you’re in public.   To take it off once you return, untie it from the back — don’t touch the front of it.   You should immediately wash the mask after returning so it doesn’t contaminate your belongings.   Wash your hands immediately after you’ve taken it off, and again after you’ve washed the mask.     Are masks even effective?    Homemade mask  studies have shown that they’re significantly less effective than surgical masks  — and they’re certainly no replacement for the essential N95 respirators health care workers must wear to treat patients.   “Homemade masks are partially effective,” said Dr. Koushik Kasanagottu, an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Maryland.   They offer a physical barrier from viral particles, he said, but they don’t have the filters that N95 respirators do.   But they’re better than nothing, especially for people who only go out in public to make a quick trip to the grocery store or pharmacy, said Anna Davies and Raina MacIntyre, public health researchers and authors of two separate studies on the effectiveness of cloth mask.   It’s important to note, though, that masks cannot replace social distancing measures. Maintaining at least six feet of distance from others and staying home as much as possible is still the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.   How do you clean them?    You should launder the masks before and after each use to clean off any germs you might have picked up in public. Hand wash the masks or put them in a mesh wash bag in the washing machine so they don’t fall apart, and use a high heat setting.   What if my craft store is closed or out of supplies?    Crafters on Etsy  aren’t sold out of face masks yet. It’s difficult to discern how effective these masks are since you didn’t craft them yourself, but you can compare them to our mask tutorial before you buy — does it cover your nose and mouth? Are there pleats? Will it tightly seal around your face?   You likely don’t need to buy more than a few masks — physicians recommend that  only one member of each household runs errands in public .   It may take longer than usual to ship the masks, so be aware of this when you buy.   And be sure to wash the masks before you wear them.   If you can’t access masks at all, then  keep washing your hands , maintaining distance from others and following other social distancing measures. Staying home is the best defense against coronavirus, after all.   The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

As Demand For Local Produce Grows, Howard County Launches App For Residents To Find More Fresh Food Options

Many local farms have seen an increased demand for their products during the coronavirus pandemic.

GLENELG, Md. (WJZ) —  Many local farms have seen an increased demand for their products during the coronavirus pandemic.  As people grow wary of making frequent trips to the grocery store and struggle to find stocked shelves, many are turning to farms for local, fresh and safe food products.   “We’ve been trying for years to get people to try to buy local and I believe the pandemic has actually helped us make people realize that buying local is better,” said Jamie Brown, Owner and Operator of TLV Tree Farm.   TLV Tree Farm in Howard County  says right now, business is up. So much so, they’re gearing up to provide more meats, eggs and vegetables to meet the rising demand from the community.   “We didn’t have the supply when the demand hit, which we had no idea that the demand was going to hit as early as it did, but we will catch up,” said Brown.   To make it easier for residents to find more options of fresh local farm products, Howard County launched an  interactive online map called “HoCo Farms Connect”  on Tuesday.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This pandemic just not only was a challenge, but it created an opportunity for us to really help people understand to shop local,” said Calvin Ball, Howard County Executive.   Through the database, shoppers can search for the type of products they’re looking for such produce, dairy or meats. From there, the database connects them with the available farms.   County officials hope this will encourage more people to continue supporting the farm-to-table culture.   “Every dollar that people spend shopping locally, about 67 cents goes back into our local community,” said Ball.

Maryland Food Bank Hires 30 Temporary Workers To Help Pack Food For Families In Need During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
The Maryland Food Bank has recently hired 30 temporary full-time employees to help pack "back up boxes" amid the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Maryland Food Bank has recently hired 30 temporary full-time employees to help pack “back up boxes” amid the coronavirus pandemic.  It’s a job that’s typically done by volunteers however due to the uncertainty of the volunteer network and the increase demand the food bank decided to bring on the additional employees.   The new team is cranking out boxes at record pace, up to 2,000 a day, all while earning an essential paycheck.   “Our ability to provide them with some financial support by providing a job, obviously keeps them from having to present themselves at a food bank perhaps,” Rick Condon, the VP of Operations at the Maryland Food Bank, said.   Beth Sopel worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years before being laid off.   “It was very jarring for me,” Sopel said. “I went from working all the time to now working at all.”   Sopel is now one of the employees packing up these boxes of food.

A complete box is $50 and it provides enough food to feed a family of four for up to a week.  You can also donate money to cover individual items in the box .

Nebraska Outdoor Outlet Mall Plans To Reopen Before State’s Coronavirus Cases Peak
.W
Despite a steady increase in coronavirus cases in Nebraska, owners of a major outdoor outlet mall near Omaha is planning to become one of the first malls across the country to fully re-open.

GRETNA, Neb. (CBS Local)  — Despite a steady increase in coronavirus cases in Nebraska, owners of a major outdoor outlet mall near Omaha are planning to become one of the first malls across the country to fully re-open.  In a flier distributed to retailers on Tuesday,  Nebraska Crossing Outlets  in Gretna said the April 24 “soft opening” is an unveiling of newly remodeled restaurants and outdoor spaces.   Nebraska Crossing said it would gradually transition to a formal grand re-opening in May, according to the owner.   The flier says the outdoor shopping center has thorough cleaning practices in place, including taking employees’ temperatures and having them wear protective masks and gloves.     Owner of Nebraska Crossing Outlets plans to reopen mall this month amid pandemic:  https://t.co/m89v2rEIc2   pic.twitter.com/CmBAcklZiL   — Omaha World-Herald (@OWHnews)  April 14, 2020     “We’re looking at the great opportunity to set some best practices and help our retailers open their portfolios across the country,” owner Rod Yates told the  Omaha World-Herald .   But the  Nebraska Hospital Association , which represents 93 hospitals, said the move “poses serious risks to the health of all Nebraskans.”   “Quite simply, it’s irresponsible for a nonessential retailer to open its doors to the public in the middle of a pandemic,” NHA President Laura J. Redoutey said Tuesday in a  statement .   Nebraska is one of seven states in the U.S. to have no official stay-at-home order, urging citizens to practice social distancing guidelines without making them mandatory.     On Tuesday, Nebraska Crossing announced plans to reopen later this month. Today, Douglas County Health Director Dr. Adi Pour said she's disappointed with the outlet mall's plans to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic.  https://t.co/8CSXrhL4Mn   — KMTV 3 News Now (@3NewsNowOmaha)  April 15, 2020     As of Wednesday, the state has  documented  more than 950 coronavirus cases and 21 COVID-19 related deaths. The state’s peak is expected around  May 2 , eight days after the outlet mall is supposed to reopen.   Governor Pete Ricketts, who has issued several measures that forced many businesses to close, said on Tuesday the mall and other stores are free to open as long as they follow social-distancing orders.   “If companies are looking to be able to get prepared for some point down the road when those restrictions are loosened, that’s OK, but anybody who’s operating still needs to continue to follow all the guidelines,” he said.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A mobile farmers market is now delivering fresh produce and basic necessities to the doors of those most vulnerable to COVID-19, free of charge.  The Civic Works’ Mobile Farmers Market is traditionally used to sell fresh, locally grown produce at low prices in areas where healthy food is limited, but COVID-19 has made them temporarily change their mission.   “We knew we had to do something really quickly,” said Gwen Kokes, the Civic Works’ Food & Farm Program director. “A lot of older adults are really reliant on us.”   They decided to deliver produce, toilet paper, hand sanitizer and even prepared meals to their door, free of charge.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “They can’t come outside their building and purchase food from us like normal,” said Kokes. “So we’re going to them, we’re making the food free so there’s nothing they can touch. They don’t have to touch cash, they don’t have to touch their snap benefits card.”   They anticipate giving out over 3,000 pounds of food a week during this crisis.   “We knew soon enough to plant more into the ground, and we just took money from our credit line and planted way more than what we’re used to,” explained Kokes.

Emergency Study Hopes To Find Answers For Coronavirus Patients Struggling To Survive
.W
With no known cure to COVID-19, doctors across the country are participating in an emergency study that could help patients struggling to survive.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  With no known cure to COVID-19, doctors across the country are participating in an emergency study that could help patients struggling to survive.  Inside Saint Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, doctors say four COVID-19 patients are hanging onto life.   “I’m an ICU doctor, so all my patients are critically ill,” Dr. Pablo Garcia said. “All have varying degrees of organ failure.”   ER’s across the country are swamped, overflowing with desperately ill coronavirus patients.   But doctors think people who have already beaten the virus are walking around with life saving antibodies in their plasma.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The Mayo Clinic and hospitals across the country want those survivors to donate now.   Saint Agnes is part of this emergency clinical trial.   “The idea of this experimental therapy is that, if we can get plasma from someone who has been sick with COVID-19 but has recovered, that plasma carries antibodies to the virus,” Garcia said, “We can transfuse those antibodies to someone who is still fighting the virus and potentially help their immune system.”   Baltimore City has at least two institutions partnering with the Mayo Clinic, including Johns Hopkins University.   The Red Cross will also be on the frontlines of this emergency study, collecting plasma from survivors.   Kevin Greenaugh said the study is a no brainer and that he’ll donate if he qualifies.   “I just think that from a spiritual perspective, from a society perspective, that if I have the antibody in my body that can help other people, this is something that I should do,” Greenaugh said.   It’s a possible fix patients and their doctors across the country hope will work.   “We don’t know yet, but it certainly has potential to be a game-changer,” Garcia said.

This action will not only protect correctional officers, first responders, and inmates, but also our state at large.”   Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services table of positive COVID-19 cases by facility   The AFSCME Union represents many state workers and said on a conference call that there are “glaring holes in the actions at every single faculty.”   Jessup Correctional officer Oluwadamilola Olaniyan recounted how he assisted a fellow officer who became ill and collapsed—then tested positive for COVID-19.   “Nobody called the people that were in close proximity. I was concerned that I was exposed, and I’m taking it to my family,“ Olaniyan said from quarantine. “We are not being protected the way we should be protected.”   WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren spoke to another officer in Jessup who asked to remain anonymous. That officer agreed with AFSCME’s assessment that the prisons are “ticking time bombs” but said they were able to get some equipment including face shields, which they have to reuse.   “A ticking time bomb I’d say that’s definitely pretty accurate. It’s just like you’re waiting for something to happen,“ the officer said. “The tensions are very high right now in the prisons. Everybody’s on edge.“     ‘We are seeing the ticking time bomb before our eyes’ Maryland employee union AFSCME calls for more protective equipment, emergency pay, cites dangers at correctional facilities  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/pf581QHloe   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  April 16, 2020         The AFSCME union has called for emergency pay increases to be reinstated, more protective equipment and consistent policies and health checks in each facility.

As concern for inmates and correctional officers grows, the chief judge of Maryland is ordering lower courts to identify juvenile offenders who could be released amid the pandemic, as well as identify offenders in general who are at risk for contracting the coronavirus for possible release.   In an order Tuesday , Judge Mary Ellen Barbera said lower courts should identify the high-risk offenders in order to protect the inmate population as a whole.   Before releasing an offender, the courts should consider whether that person is a threat to the community, whether the facility they’re being held at can address coronavirus-related medical issues and whether the person shows any symptoms of the virus, the order reads.   READ MORE: Coronavirus Latest: Judge Orders Courts To Identify Juvenile Offenders Who Could Be Released Amid COVID-19 Pandemic   In addition, the order also directs lower courts to set hearings for matters like child support contempt, minor probation violations and failure to appear in court within the next business day.   Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby advocated for offenders to be released, while Gov. Larry Hogan has said it’s not a priority of his.

COVID-19 And Pregnancy: What Moms-To-Be Need To Know
.W
With the coronavirus pandemic continuing in the United States, here's what expecting mothers need to know about how the disease can affect them and their appointments.

How will this affect me and my baby?   Is it still safe to go to the doctor’s office for appointments?   Should I be doing more to keep me and my baby healthy?   Amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, these are the kinds of questions you’re probably asking yourself if you’re pregnant.   There is still much for medical experts to learn about how COVID-19 could cause problems during pregnancy, whether it can be passed to the fetus, and how it can affect the health of babies after birth. But there is concern for women with high-risk pregnancies, including women who have diabetes, chronic hypertension or lung problems.   Pregnant women in general experience changes in their bodies that can increase risk for infection, and with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections (such as influenza), they may have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   “Pregnant women have increased needs for good pulmonary function. Therefore, any pregnant woman who has significant lung problems would be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection. This would include severe asthma, HIV, chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and immunocompromise states,” says  Pedro P. Arrabal, M.D. , director of maternal-fetal medicine at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore. “Our recommendations are extrapolations from women having been infected with influenza. However, much information is still unknown about the effects of this virus in pregnancy, and pregnant women should not be lulled into a false sense of complacency about this infection.”   At the first sign of infection, “such as difficulty breathing, fever, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, chest pressure, nausea and vomiting,” and dehydration, you need to be medically evaluated, Arrabal says. “There may be a higher risk of preterm labor and you should be evaluated ASAP. If there is a clinical need for radiologic studies such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan, they can safely be performed during pregnancy and they should not be delayed,” he adds.    Is it still safe (or necessary) to go to appointments?   Do you have to conduct all your pregnancy appointments at the doctor’s office during the COVID-19 pandemic? Well, if your pregnancy isn’t considered high-risk, and depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy, telemedicine visits may be an option for you. Sinai, for instance, recently implemented telemedicine visits via phone calls for checkups and, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, is prepared to conduct phone visits during the early weeks of pregnancy after the all-important initial in-person pregnancy visit.   “Coincidentally, we had recently instituted telemedicine for diabetes education and genetic counseling. This has worked out very well,” Arrabal says.   Many patients, however, require ultrasounds and an evaluation of their vital signs, particularly those at risk for hypertension. “Many of the ultrasound procedures and fetal testing that we do in pregnancy have significant time limitations and need to be performed at specific times during the pregnancy,” Arrabal says.   Also, if you are at 24 weeks gestational age and beyond, you will need to be seen in person. “It is important to have regular blood pressure checks and visits with a physician as you get closer to your delivery date,” says  Elizabeth Zadzielski, M.D. , chief of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Sinai.   Zadzielski stresses that an in-person visit is necessary if you just recently found out you’re pregnant.   “It is extremely important to have that first ultrasound to determine how far along you are. Important blood work and tests, such as the first trimester screen, still need to be done as well,” Zadzielski says.   In addition, if you’ve been experiencing problems with bleeding or decreased fetal movement, or if there are concerns about preterm labor, you will need to be seen in a doctor’s office or OB triage unit. “Patients whose fetuses are at risk for compromise and stillbirth need to be seen on a regular basis for fetal testing,” Arrabal says.   He adds: “Delivery still needs to occur in the hospital or birthing center setting, and not at home.”   Take precaution   What should you do if you’re pregnant to protect you and your baby amid the COVID-19 outbreak? Essentially the same things as the general public: good hand hygiene (use soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer), social distancing, plenty of rest and nutritious meals.   “Try to get outside and into some fresh air,” Zadzielski says. “As compelling as the news may be, try to limit exposure to the media blitz that can provoke anxiety.”   Visit lifebridgehealth.org or call 410-601-WELL to learn more about our services at LifeBridge Health and scheduling an appointment.

Sanitizer Or Soap: Is One Better Than The Other?
.W
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, there are benefits to both hand washing and hand sanitizer.

Soap and hand sanitizer are disappearing quickly from store shelves amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic—sanitizer being the rarer find.   But is one more effective than the other?  Alexander Chen, M.D., FACP , of the  Division of Infectious Diseases  at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, explains the importance of both:    Which should you buy?   If you’re having trouble finding hand sanitizer and all you have is soap, it’s okay. You’re not stuck with the inferior option.   Both soap and alcohol-based sanitizer are effective for eliminating coronaviruses. “Both methods should disrupt the coating of the virus, while soap also helps remove the virus mechanically,” Chen says.   If you are lucky enough to find a bottle of hand sanitizer, check the label and make sure it has at least 60 percent alcohol content. Sanitizer comes in handy when you’re out and about and a sink isn’t nearby, though you shouldn’t use it if your hands are dirty or greasy.   Antibacterial soap is a good choice, but really “either type of soap will be fine,” Chen says. If your hands become dry from frequent hand-washing, use whichever hand lotion you are accustomed to. “I don’t have any preference, but some people may have sensitive skin and can look for products that are hypoallergenic,” Chen says.   Another good thing about that elusive hand sanitizer: most have a moisturizer included.   What about washing your face?   One of the main things you are urged to do to protect yourself from the coronavirus is avoid touching your face (mainly your eyes, nose and mouth). But what if you need to wash your face? Or apply makeup and other facial products? Or floss?   It’s still OK to do the necessary things involving your face—but after you clean your hands thoroughly.   “You should perform hand hygiene before touching your face, including eating and drinking,” Chen says. “Since many of us touch our face without realizing it, try to keep track of where your hands are.”   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (especially after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing). When you use sanitizer, cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.   “If you are caring for or with anyone who might be sick, perform hand hygiene after you touch anything. In addition, if you are in a high-traffic area, you can use hand sanitizer any time you touch anything that might not be clean,” Chen says.   Try to avoid touching as many surfaces as possible when you’re in public. “I like to keep my hands in my pockets when I’m out, that way I minimize what I touch,” Chen says.

JARRETSVILLE, Md. (WJZ) —  It’s an annual trek for many Maryland families, engaged couples and expecting parents every fall for Instagram-worth photos with beautiful sunflowers. The event known as “Sunflowers in Jarrettsville” will not open this year due to the coronavirus.

It's no secret that Maryland businesses, particularly small businesses, have been hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  It’s no secret that Maryland businesses, particularly small businesses, have been hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Like many small businesses, the Art of Balance Wellness Spa in Baltimore has had to shut down the majority of its in-person appointments, now relying on virtual health and counseling sessions with their clients.   “When we talk to other small businesses, they know exactly what we’re going through and we know what they’re going through,” Dr. Aderonke Omotade, of the Art of Balance Wellness Spa in Baltimore, said.   Co-owners — Dr.’s Omotade and Nia Banks — just received their paperwork after applying for their paycheck protection plan loan, known as PPP.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     It’s a program that provides forgivable loans for businesses to keep employees on the payroll.   But if you haven’t already applied, bad news. The program has run out of money, at least for now.   “I think a lot of us have been hearing that many mom-and-pop shops have had difficulty accessing these funds, they don’t have connections to these big banks, so we want to make sure as we replenish the fund, we want to make sure the fund gets to all the small businesses that need it,” Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen said.   The Small Business Administration said Thursday it wouldn’t be accepting any more applications. So far, it has approved more than 1.6 million PPP loan applications, totaling $339 billion from more than 4,900 lenders.   The shortage is what prompted Van hollen — and others — to write a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking Congress to immediately replenish funds.   He said it’s essential to provide this economic lifeline for Maryland businesses.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

COVID-19 Patients Recovering Quickly After Getting Experimental Drug Remdesivir
.W
Coronavirus patients who are getting an experimental drug called remdesivir have been recovering quickly, with most going home in days, STAT News reported Thursday after it obtained a video of a conversation about the trial.

(CNN) —  Coronavirus patients who are getting an experimental drug called remdesivir have been recovering quickly, with most going home in days, STAT News reported Thursday after it obtained a video of a conversation about the trial.  The patients taking part in a clinical trial of the drug have all had severe respiratory symptoms and fever, but were able to leave the hospital after less than a week of treatment,  STAT quoted the doctor  leading the trial as saying.   “The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish,”  Dr. Kathleen Mullane , an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago who is leading the clinical trial, said in the video.   Mullane did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.   The University of Chicago said Mullane’s comments constituted partial information.   “Partial data from an ongoing clinical trial is by definition incomplete and should never be used to draw conclusions about the safety or efficacy of a potential treatment that is under investigation,” it said in a statement.   “In this case, information from an internal forum for research colleagues concerning work in progress was released without authorization. Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”   There is no approved therapy for the Covid-19, which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in some patients. But the National Institutes of Health  is organizing trials  of several drugs and other treatments, among them remdesivir.   The drug, made by Gilead Sciences, was tested against Ebola with little success, but multiple studies in animals showed the drug could both prevent and treat coronaviruses related to Covid-19, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).   Back in February, the World Health Organization said remdesivir showed potential against Covid-19.   STAT said it obtained and viewed a copy of the video discussion Mullane had last week with colleagues about the trial.   “Most of our patients are severe and most of them are leaving at six days, so that tells us duration of therapy doesn’t have to be 10 days,” she was quoted as saying.   However, the trial does not include what’s known as a control group, so it will be difficult to say whether the drug is truly helping patients recover better. With a control arm, some patients do not receive the drug being tested so that doctors can determine whether it’s the drug that is really affecting their condition.   Trials of the drug are ongoing at dozens of other clinical centers, as well. Gilead is sponsoring tests of the drug in 2,400 patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in 152 trial sites around the world. It’s also testing the drug in 1,600 patients with moderate symptoms at 169 hospitals and clinics around the world.   Gilead said it expected results from the trial by the end of the month.   “We understand the urgent need for a COVID-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir,” the company said in a statement to CNN. But it said a few stories about patients are just that — stories.   “The totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial. Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19,” Gilead said.

According to the data, 37 percent of residents are staying home, making Maryland the sixth-highest jurisdiction in the country based on percentages of residents staying home.   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   The data shows the percentage of Marylanders who stayed at home began to increase around mid-March, around the time Gov.

Washington, D.C. topped the list with 54 percent of residents staying home, followed by New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Michigan. Those four states are among the hardest-hit areas in the country.   “What we at the University of Maryland are studying in terms of the balance between privacy protection and fighting this pandemic is that we advocate for an opt-in approach,” Zhang said.

‘I Think It Could Be A Game Changer’ | Frederick Company Develops Technology To Disinfect N95 Masks
.W
A company in Frederick is developing new technology that disinfects and decontaminates face masks.

FREDERICK, Md. (WJZ) —  A company in Frederick is developing new technology that disinfects and decontaminates face masks.  Doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients have no choice but to reuse their N95 masks during this pandemic, putting them at risk of getting the virus themselves.   So, InPro Technologies President Eric Couch and his team — including his brother and dad — decided to do something about it.   “The fact that they can’t have the necessary (personal protective equipment) to do their jobs is unacceptable,” Couch said.   Over the last week and a half, they’ve been designing and building a machine that disinfects the masks in about a minute or less using the power of UV technology.   “It could be running batches through a conveyorized system like ours exposed to UV energy that can inactivate the coronavirus,” Couch said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The machine could process about 10,000 masks a day and could be sent to hospitals around the country, but they’re still waiting on approval from the FDA. Couch hopes that approval could come in the next few weeks   He said he’s only aware of two other types of machines that have been developed to disinfect masks and believes his could make a big difference in this pandemic.   “I think it could be a game-changer,“ he said.

Coronavirus Latest: Maryland Schools Will Remain Closed Through May 15

Maryland schools will remain closed through May 15.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland schools will remain closed through May 15. Officials said they would continue to evaluate the moving situation before making an ultimate decision about schools closing.  “After extensive consultation with the State Board of Education and leading public health experts in the state. I am extending the closure of schools, through May 15,” State Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon said Friday.   Salmon addressed Maryland parents, students and teachers during Gov. Larry Hogan’s press conference.   CORONAVIRUS LATEST:     Gov. Hogan To Unveil Maryland Strong Roadmap To Recovery Plan Next Week   Baltimore City Schools Officials Look To Address Digital Divide As Learning Continues Online Due To COVID-19 Pandemic   No Decision Yet About Maryland Schools Closing Through June   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland     “With regards to the remainder of the school year in the summer, we will use this time to examine every option and continue to develop a long term plan for recovery,” Salmon added.   DC officials closed the district schools early on May 29  and moved to online learning through the remainder of the year.   Maryland schools have been closed since March 13 and Salmon previously announced schools would remain closed until April 24.   “In a very short timeframe school systems have continued to increase their digital presence and capabilities to provide learning opportunities to all students all school systems must submit these continuity of learning plans to the Maryland State Department of Education for review,” Salmon said.   Salmon had previously made that announcement  during a school board meeting earlier this week. The plans must include their distance learning platform, the technology they have available and how the students who don’t have access to the device or the internet will learn.   The plans will also describe the roles and responsibilities of school administrators, instructional assistants, students, and parents. They must also describe how their school system plans to address equity, including special education, English learners, homeless students, students with academic needs and gifted students. They must also determine how teachers and staff will continue professional development and what resources will be available to students and teachers.   “We are helping school systems, obtain these resources such as additional devices platforms for learning and expanded broadband capabilities that they need to carry out their plans in equitable and meaningful ways,” Salmon said. “We are hopeful that the additional $207 million in funding from the federal CARES ACT, 90% of which will go directly to local school systems, will help address gaps and the availability of these resources.”   Any lost instructional time may end up being made up over the summer.   “State and local school officials are preparing for a number of scenarios, depending on when our educators and students would be able to reenter school buildings,” she added.   Salmon said the uncertainty has created anxiety across the school communities, especially for high school seniors.   “We want seniors and their families to have an opportunity to recognize their wonderful accomplishments from their time in high school and receive their diplomas,” she added. “I will let you know that local superintendents have been working on a number of creative alternatives to ensure our high school seniors receive the recognition they deserve.”   Baltimore County elementary school teacher and Maryland State Education Association (MSEA) President Cheryl Bost released the following statement:   “This is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators, and state. Educators will continue to do our best for our students as together we navigate the challenges of crisis distance learning. We know that this type of learning is no substitute for in-person learning, and we will need to be thoughtful and serious about how we help students recover from this crisis. Recent weeks have magnified existing inequities—whether of technology access, food security, or otherwise—that our students face every day and that challenge their ability to succeed in school. We must come together to address these issues over the short- and long-term. Everyone’s safety is paramount, but we remain hopeful that educators and students will be able to spend time together again at their schools before this school year is over.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

‘Reopen Maryland’ Protest Planned In Annapolis Saturday

A group of Marylanders plan to protest in Annapolis Saturday to reopen the state after Gov. Larry Hogan put the state under "stay at home" order on March 30 due to the coronavirus.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  A group of Marylanders plan to protest in Annapolis Saturday to reopen the state after Gov. Larry Hogan put the state under “stay at home” order on March 30 due to the coronavirus.  The group, known as Reopen Maryland, plans to protest downtown around noon. They want the governor to reopen Maryland by May 1.   “We are the strongest country on the planet and have put a man on the moon, there is no compelling reason why we can’t protect the sick and vulnerable and get our economy back to work,” a Facebook event says.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The group says more than 13,000 Marylanders want the state to “return to normalcy.” They say thousands have signed a petition to reopen the state.   “Besides being a loss of jobs and vital tax revenue, a shuttered business is a shattered dream. We can preserve those dreams AND protect our citizens,” said Spokesperson Caryn Abbott, of Pokomoke City, in a statement.   In a press conference earlier this week, Gov. Hogan said he was starting to make plans on the state’s recovery post-coronavirus, however, he said the state;s COVID-19 numbers continue to rise and ordered people to start wearing masks while shopping and using public transit starting Saturday morning at 7 a.m.   Hogan attended a 3 p.m. call with  President Donald Trump Thursday , where Trump outlined procedures for reopening states.     President Trump, in a call with governors Thursday, described frustrations other world leaders have shown about COVID-19 and appeared to blame China: "This could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped, and it should have stopped." CBS News obtained the audio  pic.twitter.com/Dl8PqOLAtf   — CBS News (@CBSNews)  April 17, 2020     The President said governors will have the say in how fast to recover.   Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer says protests can lead to extension of stay-at-home orders   “The shutdown is a broadly destructive solution to a problem that could be solved with far more targeted approaches,” said Spokesperson Kelly Ulrich, of Glen Burnie. “Meanwhile, our most vulnerable citizens – children with special education needs, small business owners, people with mental health conditions, and Marylanders who live paycheck to paycheck are suffering in unimaginable ways.”   The group would need to get a permit through the city of Annapolis to protest.

Foods To Boost Your Mood, Now That You Really Need It
.W
Consuming healthy mood-boosting foods can deliver important brain nutrients while positively impacting your well-being.

(CNN) —  It’s all too easy to reach for comfort foods when feeling stressed or anxious.  Consuming that extra scoop of ice cream or another handful of chips or cookies, however, can cause feelings of guilt — and even more stress — along with fatigue and irritability from sugar highs and lows.   Yet the opposite is also true: Consuming healthy mood-boosting foods can deliver important brain nutrients while positively impacting your well-being.   Below are some nutritious and delicious foods that can improve your frame of mind while helping you avoid the #quarantine15 and other related health issues.   Healthy, mood-boosting comfort foods   We know that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish — particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — play an important role in brain development. But these fats may also play a role in our mental health, too. In one meta-analysis involving 26 studies and over 150,000 participants, researchers found that consuming high amounts of fatty fish may help  protect us from depression .   Another study examining the mechanisms by which omega-3s work concluded that while many factors may contribute to a rise in depression, “dietary recommendations suggesting proper intake of  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  … can result in substantial benefits for the general population.”   “Those who consume ample amounts of the omega-3 fat DHA are less prone to depression, aggressiveness and hostility,” according to registered dietitian Elizabeth Somer, author of “Food and Mood” and medical advisory board member for Persona Nutrition.   The healthy fat “helps form healthy membranes that easily transport nutrients into brain cells, lowers inflammation and raises serotonin levels,” Somer added. Serotonin is one of the key neurotransmitters influencing our mood, so incorporating plenty of DHA in your diet can help you maintain a balanced outlook.   Somer recommends aiming for at least two servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel or sardines, or looking for foods fortified with the omega-3 DHA. For a tasty way to enjoy omega-3 fats, check out my simple salmon recipe below.   Green veggies: spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts   These green veggies are a source of folate, a B vitamin that’s essential for the body’s production of serotonin, according to Somer.   In one meta-analysis, researchers found that  individuals with depression consume less folate  and have lower blood levels of the vitamin compared to those without depression.   In addition to increasing the risk for depression, poor intake of folate is also linked to fatigue and poor memory.   Somer recommends consuming at least 400 micrograms of folate per day, an amount found in 1 ½ cups of sautéed spinach. Beans, peas, lentils, avocado and strawberries are other good sources of folate.   Probiotics: yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi   You may have heard a lot about probiotics and their role in keeping our digestive tract healthy, but recent research suggests that probiotics may also play a role in keeping up our spirits. One study found that  probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts  associated with sad moods, and it suggested that probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for depression.   Probiotics can help  alleviate depressive symptoms , according to another recent review involving 10 studies. There is a need, however, for more research to determine the ideal duration of treatment, dosage and strain of probiotics to achieve better mental health.   One of the easiest ways to enjoy a daily dose of probotics is to consume a cup of low-fat yogurt with fresh fruit or a smoothie with yogurt as a snack.   Whole grains: oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread   Whole grains are rich in B vitamins that are important for energy and optimal brain health. Thanks to their fiber content, whole grains also help to keep blood sugar from spiking and crashing, which can help you avoid mood swings.   “If you’re eating bread, reach for the whole wheat over the white, since it also stabilizes blood sugar levels,” Somer said. “Refined grains found in white bread can send you on a blood sugar roller coaster, leaving you jittery, grumpy and hungry.”   Carbohydrates including whole grains also boost levels of serotonin, the “feel-good brain chemical,” according to Somer. Adding some protein, like chicken, legumes, fish or nut butter with whole grains can help, too, as protein triggers the release of norepinephrine, a brain chemical that provides an energy and mood lift.   A whole grain bagel with peanut butter, for example, can make for a nutritious mini-meal. Somer also likes whole grain crackers or bread sticks with low-fat cheese.   Vitamin D: Egg yolks, fatty fish; fortified milks   We’ve talked about vitamin D and its relation to bone health and immunity, but research has also revealed a connection between vitamin D and mental health. In one recent meta-analysis involving over 30,000 people, those with  low vitamin D levels  were more likely to be depressed.   Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with  low moods  and poor cognitive performance in older adults.   Our bodies synthesize vitamin D from the sun’s ultraviolet light, so most of us can meet at least some of our D needs during sunnier months. Certain factors including darker skin and air pollution, however, can reduce the ability of the sun to produce vitamin D in human skin, according to Dr. Michael Holick, an expert on Vitamin D research from Boston University.   So in the wintertime, it’s especially important to seek out vitamin D-rich foods, like fatty fish, eggs and fortified foods and beverages, or vitamin D supplements.   Yes, dark chocolate (in moderation)   This sweet treat can definitely give us a mood boost. Chocolate contains caffeine and  theobromine, a compound that may affect mood . The popular indulgence may also boost serotonin levels.   What’s more, dark chocolate also contains  healthful flav a nols  that have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and improve cognition.   To keep weight in check, limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily, or about 150 calories.   Coffee and tea   Coffee and tea are sources of caffeine, which can give us a lift.   “When we consume caffeine, it has positive effects on mood and alertness, and people like these beneficial effects,” said Mary M. Sweeney, an instructor who researches caffeine’s effects on individuals in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.   One  meta-analysis  revealed that consuming coffee (and tea) may help protect against depression.   Just keep in mind that people vary in their tolerance to caffeine. “Many people consume caffeine without negative consequences, but for some individuals, either regularly consuming too much caffeine or consuming too much at once can cause distress,” Sweeney said.   Green tea has less caffeine than coffee, is a rich source of the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG, and also contains the amino acid theanine, which may help  reduce stress  and  promote calm feelings .

Coronavirus Testing Needs To Go Up By 350K Per Day For US To Reopen, Researchers Say
.W
If the United States wants the economy to open back up -- and stay that way -- coronavirus testing must go up to at least 500,000 per day, Harvard researchers said.

(CNN) —  If the United States wants the economy to open back up — and stay that way — coronavirus testing must go up to at least 500,000 per day, Harvard researchers said.  Testing nationwide is currently at 150,000 per day, they said, adding that “If we can’t be doing at least 500,000 tests a day by May 1, it is hard to see any way we can remain open.”   The US has reported more than 735,000 coronavirus cases and 39,090 deaths, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University . Though some officials have warned against it, several states are looking to reopen as soon as possible.   The research on the testing shortfall was done by Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Thomas Tsai, researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Benjamin Jacobson, research assistant at the Harvard Global Health Institute.   And the number of positive tests much also be much lower, the researchers said. In the US, 20% of those tested for coronavirus get positive results. The World Health Organization has said that to reopen, that number should be between 3% to 12%.   In a three-part guideline released last week, the White House said states can enter the first phase toward reopening once they see a continued decrease over two weeks. Experts have long said one of the major determining factors behind governors’ decisions to reopen their economies should be testing.   Testing is crucial to determine who’s infected and a risk to others.   Contamination delayed tests   The US is currently lacking the testing capacity critical to reopening, and the roll out of tests was stalled from the start of the national outbreak.   That delay stemmed from contamination in manufacturing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coronavirus test, multiple health officials told CNN. Part of that contamination came from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. It said the test was made in a CDC laboratory instead of one of its manufacturing facilities, which is not consistent with its protocol.   “Routine quality control measures aim to identify these types of issues. Those measures were not sufficient in this circumstance, and CDC implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing this issue moving forward,” CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said.   States easing restrictions   Some states are already taking steps to begin reopening, though the changes are gradual and limited mostly to outdoor activities.   In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to announce Monday that he lifted restrictions on beach access and retail stores, according to a report from The Post and Courier newspaper in Charleston. In Florida, residents flocked to Jacksonville beaches after officials announced a soft opening Friday night allowing for recreational activities for several hours each day.   But Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said the openings do not mean the area is done flattening the curve but provide a responsible way to exercise outdoors.   Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Friday easing some measures next week — ordering state parks to reopen by Monday but directing residents to wear face coverings, keep a distance and stay in groups of five people or less. The state has more than 18,000 reported infections.   Abbott said the process of reopening the state will happen gradually and will be guided by medical experts.   In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz signed an order allowing many outdoor activities — including golfing, boating, hunting and biking — to resume Saturday morning, as long as residents follow social distancing guidelines, avoid crowded spaces and stay close to home.   “The only way this is going to work even with something like golf or shooting ranges or trails, is if we follow those, washing our hands, stay home (guidelines). If you’re sick, cough into your sleeve, wear a mask.” Walz said Friday.   Protests over orders   Meanwhile, some residents are taking to the streets demanding an end to stay-at-home orders over concerns of the economic impact.   Hundreds gathered in front of the Texas State Capitol in Austin Saturday for a “You Can’t Close America” rally. While, in New Hampshire, a crowd formed outside the State House, urging Gov. Chris Sununu to lift emergency orders.   In Indianapolis, protesters gathered outside the home of Gov. Eric Holcomb to protest his stay-at-home order, which has been extended until May 1. People in cars paraded through Annapolis, Maryland, honking their horns and holding signs asking Gov. Larry Hogan to lift restrictions.   More are planned for the coming days, including in Wisconsin, Kansas and Missouri.   Ben Dorr, who organized the group Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine, told CNN affiliate WFRV he fears economic destruction.   “Hundreds of thousands of workers are out of work. Hundreds and thousands of small family businesses are being destroyed right now under this quarantine, under this lockdown,” Dorr told the news station.

Those With High Blood Pressure Are At Greater Risk For COVID-19, Here’s What To Know To Protect Yourself
.W
The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from February 12 to March 28 showed that 9% of Covid-19 patients in the United States also self-reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

(CNN) —  As the novel coronavirus sweeps the globe, people with high blood pressure are among those who are at heightened risk for more severe complications should they contract Covid-19.  “If you get an extraordinary viral disease that will damage your lungs, you need a heart that can work with how your body responds to the virus,” said Dr. Maria Carolina Delgado-Lelievre, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.   But for those with hypertension, “Covid will cause a systemic reaction in the body in a patient that already has risk” because of poor heart health, she said. That means the virus can attack multiple organ systems.   The CDC’s  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report  from February 12 to March 28 showed that 9% of Covid-19 patients in the United States also self-reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.   High blood pressure is the most common type of heart disease and affects almost half of all American adults,  according to the CDC . That’s about 108 million Americans living with the condition.   And because hypertension is more common as people grow older, that means many of the same people with high blood pressure already overlap with the elderly population s  known to be at higher risk for contracting Covid-19.   Recognize the warning signs and know how to take your blood pressure   At a basic anatomic level, hypertension happens when there’s an abnormality in blood vessels that can impair the way oxygen is transferred to the cells.   Having a low blood oxygen level is common among those hospitalized with Covid-19, according to a study of patients in Wuhan, China published in  the Lancet  in January.   “High blood pressure is not [just] a number. The number is a guide, it’s a symbol,” Delgado-Lelievre said. “It’s telling us your vessels all over the body are not working as they should.”   High blood pressure  may not come  with noticeable symptoms, so the best way to identify it is to simply do a blood pressure reading.   To do that, first make sure you have a blood pressure cuff. Today’s technology is accurate enough that using a digital wrist cuff can get a good blood pressure reading, Delgado-Lelievre said.   Next, rest in a sturdy chair for at least five minutes, making sure to sit with your back straight. Keep your forearms supported on a flat surface such as a table, and keep the blood pressure cuff placed directly above where your elbow bends.   As you’re monitoring blood pressure over time, make sure to take the readings at the same time every day.   Any blood pressure reading of 120 over 80 is considered elevated, Delgado-Lelievre said.   Moving up from that point, the first level of hypertension is defined as 130 or higher for systolic (the top number) and 80 or higher for diastolic (the lower number), according to the American Heart Association.   Maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep taking your medicine   During the pandemic, the best way those with hypertension can manage their own risk is to follow the same guidelines as everyone else: maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and refrain from touching one’s face.   More specific to high blood pressure, it’s important to try to relax as much as possible, as stress commonly drives up readings.   With so much of society upended by social distancing and the threat of more infections, relaxing is obviously easier said than done. But do as well as you can to try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.   Although hypertension is a genetic disease, it has external drivers such as lifestyle, diet and exercise.   Delgado-Lelievre said she often tells patients that if they come up with an unusually high blood pressure reading they should try relaxation exercises, or lie down and listen to music. Then they should take their blood pressure again, and they will likely see a drop.   “Some people already know they have hypertension and know they need to monitor their blood pressure two or three times a week,” she added.   And despite some recent rumors to the contrary, doctors  still recommend  taking medications your doctor may have prescribed for blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the American Heart Association says.   “Do not stop your medications unless your doctor tells you to,” Delgado-Lelievre said.   The African American community is at higher risk   It’s not just adults over 60; African Americans are also at a higher risk for hypertension,  according to  a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “CBS Sunday Morning” that he has high blood pressure, noting “I have heart disease, and I and many black Americans are at higher risk for Covid,” he said.   CNN political commentator Van Jones  echoed Adams .   “All the doctors are saying: people who have high blood pressure and hypertension are very at risk to dying when they get this virus,” Jones said. “Nobody is saying that to the black community loudly enough.”   For groups more likely to have co-morbid conditions or other risk factors, including African Americans and the elderly, Jones had blunt advice.   “What that means is if your grandmother has high blood pressure or diabetes, grab her and pull her into the house and do not let her out for two months,” he said.   “Those with hypertension have to be very cautious about maintaining the quarantine,” Delgado-Lelievre added.

Gov. Hogan Says President Trump’s Claim That States Have Enough COVID-19 Tests To Reopen Is ‘Not Accurate’
.W
During an appearance on CNN's State of the Union show Sunday morning, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump's claim that states have enough COVID-19 tests to reopen is "not accurate."

ANNAPOLIS, MD. (WJZ) —  During an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union show Sunday morning, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump’s claim that states have enough COVID-19 tests to reopen is “not accurate.”  During a White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference Saturday afternoon, President Trump said that COVID-19 testing capabilities and capacities are “fully sufficient” to begin opening up the country.   Gov. Hogan said he believes the Trump Administration is trying to ramp up testing, but that governors across the country still don’t have sufficient capabilities.   “To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” Hogan said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests. Not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America, and from all across the world.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Gov. Hogan said that Maryland has increased its COVID-19 testing by 5,000 percent over the past month, but that it’s “nowhere near where it needs to be.”     President Trump’s claim that states have enough tests to reopen “is just absolutely false,” says Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. “It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done. That’s just not being straightforward.”  #CNNSOTU   pic.twitter.com/0K48hRAgzI   — State of the Union (@CNNSotu)  April 19, 2020     “There are things like shortages on swabs that we don’t have anywhere in America, yet you can’t do the tests without, reagents which is a part of the test,” Hogan said. “I think they’ve made some strides at the federal level, I think states are all working hard on their own to find their own testing, Lab capacity has been increasing, but it’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done. That’s just not being straightforward.”   A new testing facility in Baltimore County administered just 30 tests on Thursday because that was all they could get.   “I would have loved to have this up much sooner, but we just didn’t have the tests available,” said Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr.   This is the second day of a decline in Maryland’s reported number of cases. There are 12,830 confirmed cases and 486 confirmed deaths as of Sunday morning, an increase of 522 from Saturday.   The governor signed an executive order Sunday  expediting the release of hundreds of men and women from state correctional institutions  and over the weekend his mandate  requiring masks or face coverings  inside retail stores or while riding public transit went into effect.   “The wearing of masks is also something that we may all have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.   Cloth masks, homemade masks and bandannas all meet the governor’s requirements. Anyone who knowingly violates the governor’s order could receive a year in jail or a $5,000 fine, or both.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Signs Executive Order To Expedite Release Of Hundreds Of Inmates In Md. Correctional Institutions
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Saturday to expedite the release of hundreds of inmates in Maryland correctional institutions in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Saturday to expedite the release of hundreds of inmates in Maryland correctional institutions in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The executive order expedites the release of inmates in Maryland correctional institutions who were already eligible to be released within the next four months, and the processing of inmates eligible for home detention.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Hogan’s executive order, said, in part:   “In order to reduce the threat to health, welfare, and safety caused by rapid transmission of COVID-19 between residents and staff in congregative correctional custody, and enable social distancing and other mitigation efforts, certain inmates must be removed from these facilities. “   The executive order also said that, “It is in public interest to prevent inmates’ exposure to the novel coronavirus by expeditiously moving them to alternative places of confinement, such as in supervised community placement or their homes.”   On April 16, 2020, there were 136 confirmed cases of the coronavirus within the Maryland correctional system, and one death was reported.   Members of Maryland’s federal Congressional delegation wrote a letter to Gove. Larry Hogan Thursday urging him to take “aggressive actions” to stop the fast spread of COVID-19 through the state’s prison system.   “We are concerned that an outbreak of COVID-19 within Maryland’s correctional system would endanger the health of all—surrounding communities, correctional staff, first responders and inmates,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge you to strongly consider the recommendations of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh that you exercise your commutation power by working with the Maryland Parole Commission to identify and accelerate the release of inmates who pose little risk to public safety but whose continued incarceration would increase the risk of an outbreak amongst the state’s prison population. This action will not only protect correctional officers, first responders, and inmates, but also our state at large.”   Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who pushed for the supervised release of some non-violent inmates at correctional facilities across the state, said released the following statement:   “This is a victory for public health, public safety, and common sense. We applaud the Governor for taking these important steps and are pleased to see him incorporate many of the recommendations we made in a proposal we sent around a month ago. We stand ready to work with his office on implementing his plan, and will continue to develop our own policies. These actions will prevent more deaths among incarcerated people, correctional staff, and Marylanders as a whole.”   There are now more than 12,800 coronavirus cases and nearly 500 deaths in Maryland, according to new data released Sunday morning.

A beloved mother, grandmother and local nurse died last week of COVID 19 after fighting it for weeks.

COLUMBIA, Md. (WJZ) —  A beloved mother, grandmother and local nurse died last week of COVID 19 after fighting it for weeks.   Liam St. John tells WJZ his mother Evelyn Caro was born to help others.   “My mom made the business of ‘caring’ her life’s work and I can’t think of a better way to honor than to share her story,” St. John said.   Caro was a nurse for 19 years. She called her son around March 26 saying she had a fever. Her symptoms began to worsen.   “We were throwing the supplies up her balcony so she could get to them and one of them was a device to measure how much oxygen was getting to her hands,” he said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     St. John said in no time at all, his mother’s symptoms were severe and she had to call 911.   “My last words to my mom were ‘Don’t worry, I’m on my way,'” as she was being loaded into an ambulance.   After a few days at Howard General, Caro was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital.   “She lost function to her right lung, she had an infection raging, fever spiking — they were doing everything they could,” said St. John, who was able to visit her one last time.   “On Saturday, April 11, my mom passed away in the ICU at Johns Hopkins,” St. John said.   Her grandchildren were not able to say goodbye.   St. John said his mom raised three boys on her own, she was known as abuela to her grandchildren and she fought the coronavirus until the end.   As St. John reflected on his mother’s legacy, as a nurse himself, he pleaded with the public to stay home.   “I really need the public to understand the cost of selfish actions, maybe you don’t get sick, but maybe you give it to somebody else,” he said, as he expressed that many people are not allowed to visit their dying family members in hospitals around the country.   “Please don’t give up on this fight too early,” he said.   St. Johns works at Mercy Hospital and said he’s hoping hospitals can somehow start getting virtual messages to patients.   He said when they wake up, he hopes they see messages of love and hope from family, friends, church groups, local heroes, anyone who can share a positive moment instead of being surrounded by machines.

Maryland Republican Party Chairman Calls For Peter Franchot’s Chief Of Staff Len Foxwell To Resign Over Facebook Post
.W
The chairman of the Maryland Republican Party is calling for the chief of staff of the state's comptroller to be fired over controversial comments he made on social media.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  The chairman of the Maryland Republican Party is calling for the chief of staff of the state’s comptroller to be fired over controversial comments he made on social media.  Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot’s chief of staff Len Foxwell Saturday responded to criticism of the controversial Facebook post in which he wrote that members of a right-wing group opposed to stay-at-home orders and other coronavirus-related restrictions should be put in a warehouse “and then let Darwin work his magic.”   Foxwell, who joined Franchot’s office in 2007,  according to his biography  with the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum where he’s a board member, shared a link to an article on Monday about a group called “The Patriot Movement” calling on people to defy coronavirus-related orders.  In the post , he wrote:   “Let’s lure them into a big, big warehouse (we’ll call it something real classy to suit their refined sensibilities, like “America MAGA Platinum Palace”) with the promise of all the unfiltered Camels they can smoke, all the Salisbury steak and banana moonpies they can eat, washed down by all the Old Crow and Icehouse they can drink.   “Plus, autographs from Scott Baio and pics with Tawny Kitean, posing all sexy and everything on a sportscar, just like in that old Whitesnake video! Get them in, bar the door and then let Darwin work his magic.”   As of Monday, Foxwell submitted his resignation from the board of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.   The post drew backlash online, with multiple commenters calling for Foxwell to be fired.   Maryland Republican Party chairman Dirk Haire also called on Franchot to fire Foxwell.   “I hope you agree with me that Mr. Foxwell’s statements suggesting the genocide of President Trump’s supporters are extraordinarily inappropriate and representative of a base and destructive mindset. A review of Mr. Foxwell’s Facebook page shows many similar posts by Mr. Foxwell,” Haire wrote.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     On Saturday, Foxwell wrote that his comments were made “in a typical spirit of sarcasm and jest” and were not directed at supporters of President Donald Trump but rather at the leaders and members of the group:   “Again, this had nothing to do with rank-and-file Trump supporters – notwithstanding my deep, searing distaste for the President’s politics and his catastrophic mismanagement of this crisis. Nor, obviously, did I ever express hope that someone would die. Any suggestions to the contrary are simply, absolutely false. By now, it’s fairly obvious that, like so many other social media brush fires that revolve around this President, a handful of provocateurs twisted unrelated content to suit their narrative of victimization and government persecution.”     Saturday night, Franchot said he stands behind Foxwell:   “It has never been my policy to comment on social media content posted by members of my staff, so long as it is done on their own time. I won’t start now. Suffice to say, however, that I remain 100 percent supportive of Len Foxwell and the exceptional work he continues to do for me and for the people of Maryland. He is an exceptional public servant, a dear family friend, and I look forward to his continued service as my Chief of Staff for years to come.”     Foxwell’s latest post came just hours after protesters filled the streets of Annapolis, calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to remove some restrictions the state put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Coronavirus Response: Doctors Connect With Patients Through Video Calls

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  While hospitals are trying to limit the exposure of COVID-19 to patients and staff, doctors are still trying to connect with patients through video calls.  As the coronavirus continues to overwhelm the state’s medical system, doctors have shifted to telemedicine delivering health care remotely in an effort to keep patients and staff safe.   In an effort to limit in-person contact, Dr. George Ruiz, a cardiologist at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital is conducting routine checkups with patients virtually.   He said the changes could expand the use of telemedicine even after the pandemic ends.   “I think that now what we can expect probably over the next year, I think you’ll see a major expansion in terms of how we can interface with patients remotely,” Ruiz said.

We will get through this together – with every branch of government working as a team until we can safely return.”   The presiding officers said they will continue to evaluate the need and time for a future special session.   “This decision to not meet in May was not taken lightly,” Senate President Bill Ferguson said. “This is a matter of balancing the safety of staff, legislators and the public, while ensuring that Legislators can continue their daily focus on serving their constituents and public in battling this virus, and preparing for the Recovery effort.”   Senate and House committees will continue to meet as needed.

Coronavirus Latest: Marylanders Turn To Insurance Marketplace For Coverage Amid Pandemic

Marylanders have until June 15 to apply for insurance online when the enrollment period ends. At this point, officials said, there is no excuse to not be insured.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  In January, James MacMillian didn’t have health insurance.  “I was getting by okay without health care,” he said.   Then, COVID-19 happened.   “My employer doesn’t offer health care and I can’t afford health care without any assistance,” MacMillian said.   Many are left to turn to the state’s marketplace for insurance.   “The urgency is there! We’re getting a lot of calls, a lot of people are filling out applications online, people are enrolling,” said Paris Barnes, a community liaison with Health Access Maryland.   Maryland reopened its enrollment period in March.   “It just felt like the right decision to reopen up the exchange,” said Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.

Here’s How Marylanders Can Get Help   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Barnes is a community liaison helping people sign up.   “We really urge people just to apply,” Barnes said.   But many people like MacMillian feared they still couldn’t afford it.   “Normally I have three jobs and that allows me to pay for my rent, my car, my car insurance, my divorce, my child custody, and for my bills I barely have anything left over every month,” he said.   “They assume that the price will be expensive given their loss of income or maybe no income right now,” Barnes said.   The exchange said that 62 percent of applications qualified for Medicaid.   “Don’t think the fact that you don’t have any income right now to pay for it or enough to pay for it don’t let that stop you,” Eberle said.   It allows people like James to now be insured.   “It’s a huge weight off my shoulders,” MacMillian said.   “The window is open all we’re asking you to do is apply and let us help you,” Barnes said.   Marylanders have until June 15 to apply for insurance online when the enrollment period ends. At this point, officials said, there is no excuse to not be insured.   Anyone who needs to enroll can do so on the “Enroll MHC” free mobile app or can get assistance by calling 1-855-642-8572.   The state reminds citizens this is for private health insurance, those who are eligible for Medicaid are able to apply year-round.

Trump: Hogan ‘Didn’t Understand Too Much About What Was Going On’ In Terms Of Coronavirus Testing Capacity In Md.
.W
President Donald Trump took aim at Maryland Governor Larry Hogan Monday, saying during his daily coronavirus update the governor "didn't understand too much" about the state's testing capacity for the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  President Donald Trump took aim at Maryland Governor Larry Hogan Monday, saying during his daily coronavirus update the governor “didn’t understand too much” about the state’s testing capacity for the coronavirus.  The president made the comments at the beginning of his news conference Monday evening. Vice President Mike Pence held a call earlier in the day with the governors of each state about the country’s “unified efforts to defeat the virus,” Trump said, describing the call as “very positive.”     He then went on to say officials gave each governor a list of labs in their state that can handle additional testing, adding that some governors, including Hogan, didn’t understand it.   “Some of the governors, like as an example the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list, he didn’t understand too much about what was going on so now I think he’ll be able to do that, it’s pretty simple,” Trump said. “They have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out. We’ll work with him and we’ll work with all the governors.”     More from White House briefing: If we have enough tests for everyone to go to phase one, why is the governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea?

Patients With Serious Medical Needs Afraid To Seek Treatment Due To Risk Of Contracting Coronavirus, Doctor Says
.W
Despite the anxiety patients may face, doctors say it's important those with serious medical conditions get the help they need before it's too late.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  While the coronavirus has been the top priority for medical personnel lately, many patients with serious medical needs still need to be seen at hospitals.  Despite the anxiety patients may face, doctors say it’s important those with serious medical conditions get the help they need before it’s too late.   Dr. Neil Roy at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore said the fear of contracting COVID-19 is pushing some people away.   “It’s actually a little bit concerning that people are having heart attacks or blood clots for their lungs and they don’t want to come to the hospital because they are worried about getting coronavirus when really they should be coming for those things,” he said.   Since the virus began spreading in Maryland, Roy said Sinai has seen a decrease in patients with non-coronavirus symptoms. That could mean patients with chest pains, broken bones or even a stroke are holding back on getting the medical help they need.

At Sinai, tents are set up to separate COVID-19 patients from those who aren’t showing any symptoms.   In hospitals nationwide, patients are screened upon arrival and given protective gear like masks to decrease potential exposure.   Doctors are shifting to using telemedicine to treat minor medical needs and to refill prescriptions.   READ MORE: Doctors Connect With Patients Through Video Calls   “You need to take your medicine every day, and it was also good to know I could get my prescriptions and not having to be subjected to other sick people,” patient Carmela Cipriano said.   Minor or serious, Roy said the message is clear: anyone having serious pain or dealing with a serious medical issue should not hesitate to get help.   “It is concerning in that a lot of patients who are waiting too long are coming in much sicker now,” he said.

Coronavirus Updates: Walk-Up COVID-19 Testing Site Will Open Monday In Annapolis
.W
A walk-up COVID-19 testing site will open next week in Annapolis, but will only accept patients with appointments.

ANNAPOLIS (WJZ) —  A walk-up COVID-19 testing site will open next week in Annapolis, but will only accept patients with appointments.  It will open up on Monday, April 20.   “One of the keys to moving our City beyond this pandemic is testing and I have been pushing for more testing from day one,” said Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley. “We appreciate the County giving us the tools to bring testing into communities so that we can focus resources on the places that need it the most.”   The testing site will have a limited number of tests on Monday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Parole Health Center, at 1950 Drew St in Annapolis.   READ MORE: A testing site opened this week at the Timonium Fairgrounds. Find out how you can get tested there.   Patients who require COVID-19 testing must be symptomatic and have an appointment.   You can schedule a test by calling the Anne Arundel County Department of Health COVID-19 Health Line at 410-222-7256. Department of Health staff will screen callers and schedule appointments over the phone.   The county reminds residents that testing will be available to those who meet the Anne Arundel County Department of Health’s testing criteria.   Insured patients will be asked to provide insurance information, but if you don’t have insurance you can be tested without charge.   “Having COVID-19 testing available in the City is a critical piece of our strategy to help  Annapolis  move beyond this pandemic,” said OEM Director Kevin Simmons.   Multiple Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program locations have been converted into drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites,  including locations in Columbia, White Oak , Glen Burnie, Waldorf and Bel Air, and  Pimlico Race Track’s parking lot  has been converted into a testing site as well.

Maryland Acquires 500K COVID-19 Tests From South Korean Lab, Gov. Hogan Wants To Test Up To 20,000 A Day
.W
Maryland received half a million test kits from South Korea, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday, saying his wife First Lady Yumi Hogan helped to close a deal with a laboratory there.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland received half a million test kits from South Korea, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday, saying his wife First Lady Yumi Hogan helped to close a deal with a laboratory there.  Hogan said he and the First Lady received the test kits Saturday morning at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. A Korean Air Boeing 777 arrived without passengers but instead with 500,000 test kits, giving Maryland the capability of increasing testing.   It was the first-ever direct flight from Seoul to Maryland.   The testing kits came from LabGenomics as a part of Operation Enduring Friendship.   Hogan recalled meeting with the South Korean president earlier this year.   “He was so proud of my wife, and he said that they considered me… a son-in-law to the Korean people, and I considered it quite an honor for him to say that that night. But I had no idea how much that would truly come to mean these two very long months later,” Hogan said.   The federal government has also purchased tests from South Korea, but this is the first sale brokered to an individual state. The tests will cost Maryland $9 million.   “$9 million to try to keep hundreds of millions of people safe and to protect thousands of lives and to get our economy back on track seems like a pretty worthwhile investment,” the governor said.     On Saturday, First Lady Yumi Hogan and I stood on the tarmac at  @BWI_Airport  to welcome the first ever Korean Air passenger plane, carrying a very important payload of LabGun  #COVID19  test kits which will give MD the capability of performing half a million coronavirus tests.  pic.twitter.com/Elf0ADIRnJ   — Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan)  April 20, 2020     The New York Times  first reported  that tests arrived after Hogan and his wife, “a Korean immigrant who speaks fluent Korean” helped secure the final deal. They started speaking to South Korea about acquiring the tests on March 28, Hogan said.   “The state of Maryland owes an incredible debt of gratitude to the people of South Korea,” the governor said. “As Maryland begins its reopening and recovery, Marylanders should feel confident knowing that we have done everything in our power and gone to every length and used every tool at our disposal to defeat this deadly virus.”   The governor credited the First Lady with helping secure the deal.   “She truly is a champion of this operation,” he said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     So far, about  71,000 coronavirus tests  have been administered in the state. Hogan said these tests will be used “right away.”   “This half a million tests is more than the four of the top five states in America have done so far in the entire COVID-19 crisis, so it’s a huge, huge step in the right direction,” Hogan said.   But the governor said they continue to search for more ways to ramp up the state’s testing capabilities.   “We’ve ramped up our labs, we’re continuing to ramp up the lab capability,” he added. “10,000 was a very aggressive goal — they’re gonna get mad at me for saying this — but I think I’m going to try to blow through that and do maybe a 200% of what their aggressive goal was and try to get up to 20,000 tests a day.”   He also made mention of comments from President Donald Trump that states should take their own initiative when it comes to finding testing supplies and other equipment.   “The (Trump) Administration made it clear over and over again that they want the states to take the lead, and we have to go out and do it ourselves, and so that’s exactly what we did,” he said.   Hogan said while expanded testing will be key to reopening Maryland, he does not want to open parts of the state piecemeal.   “Certain areas don’t have as bad of an infection rate. It may be because they haven’t done enough testing. What we don’t want is to have the neighbor next door come over if you open everything, then they’re going to be flooded with more infected folks,” he said.   Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said he salutes Gov. Hogan for his “continued strong and steady leadership, and to our extraordinary First Lady, Yumi Hogan, for her intervention and involvement in securing these much-needed and life-saving test kits.”   “The widespread use of testing conducted by the South Korean government has been cited as a chief catalyst for the sharp decline of infections in that country. ” He said in part. “Given the absence of a strong federal coordinated response, states have had to fill the void of national leadership. Fortunately here in Maryland, we have a governor who is relentless in fighting for the resources that we need to combat this pandemic effectively and to protect our citizens.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Maryland High School Athletes Lose Vital Time During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
nan

BEAR, Del.  (Capital News Service) —  This spring was supposed to be Jade Greene’s time to get noticed.   A shortstop leadoff hitter for Bishop McNamara High School since her freshman year, Greene has been waiting for her junior season to gauge the interest of college recruiters.   “I was banking on that because I really need coaches to come see me,” said Greene. “This is the year where I was like, ‘I’m going to get all these coaches to come see me and maybe I can commit this year.’ But it didn’t happen because we had no games for them to watch.”   A National Collegiate Athletic Association 2018 ruling prevented college coaches from contacting high school athletes until Sept. 1 of their junior year for softball and lacrosse. Now, with a suspended season and college applications due before the start of next season, Greene is just one example of the predicament the pandemic has caused for high school juniors hoping to take their games to the next level.   “Now, of course, a lot of that comes down to what happens this summer,” said Bishop McNamara assistant softball coach Paul O’Brien. “If she’s able to play in the summer, she’ll recover just fine. That’s a huge question mark right now.”   The timetable of returning to normalcy during this pandemic is certainly the biggest question, as college spring sports coaches typically have more time to recruit during the summer and fall, when they’re also in the offseason.   “Add on to that the (NCAA) extending the eligibility of current collegiate athletes, the junior class might be in a huge pinch as programs may not be able to financially do a ton of recruiting for that class,” O’Brien said. “So, you have five classes getting scholarship money in one form for the foreseeable future.”   While the NCAA  did allow schools to provide eligibility relief for spring sport athletes , they did so at the discretion of the schools.   For example, member Ivy League institutions have traditionally ruled against allowing graduate students to play an extra year. Schools such as Princeton, Yale and Harvard have also begun to close a loophole that would have allowed student athletes to retain their extra year of eligibility if they withdraw from this semester’s classes.   Aside from recruiting concerns, Greene said, this was likely the last opportunity for Bishop McNamara, in Forestville, Maryland, to contend for the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference state title. After coming a run short in last year’s semifinals, Greene said a large senior graduating class will likely leave the squad decimated next season.   Greene’s teammate, senior pitcher Bailey Wilcox, was only 14 strikeouts away from setting the school record — a milestone O’Brien said she would’ve completed in two games if given the opportunity.   “It really hits you there,” O’Brien said. “What these folks have been working on for the last four years is affected in a way that can’t be fixed. It’s a shame.”   The Bishop McNamara softball team is just one example of athletes all around the state missing out on chances to get recruited and achieve senior milestones.   Aaron and Andrew Ray, twins on the Loyola Blakefield high school track and field team in Towson, Maryland, were also banking on boosting their recruiting profiles. In a time-based sport that allows coaches to track down runners nationwide, Andrew said he was disappointed to not get the opportunity to improve his times before talking to college coaches.   Without another opportunity to lower his times in the 300-meter hurdles race, exclusively an outdoor event, Andrew will have to go through the college application process with his current marks.   “It’s pretty hard,” Andrew said. “I was pretty excited for this season because I feel like I was bringing everything together.”   Unlike his brother, Aaron has started talking to college coaches from schools such as Lehigh, Dartmouth and Washington and Lee. Still, with a preference of going to a larger state school such as Maryland or Penn State, the potential loss of the full spring season has forced him to become more flexible.   “It pretty much means I’ll be more open to walking-on in college if needed, especially with track and field and the way that college applications work,” Aaron said. “I might go to a college I might not have considered for track and field.”   From a coach’s perspective, Georgetown Preparatory High School, baseball coach Chris Rodriguez told Capital News Service his message to his uncommitted juniors was to stay positive and take this time to be assertive, to introduce themselves to college coaches and keep them updated on what they’re doing during the quarantine to get noticed.   “I don’t think we can do a whole lot right now other than try to be aggressive and stay in sight in some shape and form (with college coaches) that we already had connections with and try to make some new ones,” Rodriguez said. “(College coaches are) not playing either, so they’re probably in front of their computers as much as we are.”   Rodriguez, whose son Ryan is a sophomore on the varsity team, said he’s nervous about the prospect of athletes not getting a chance to compete in the summer or fall when college coaches are more focused on recruiting. Still, his message to his team has been taking this time as an opportunity to get ahead.   “You just have to find a different way to engage,” said Rodriguez, who’s also the dean of students at the Bethesda, Maryland, school. “We’re all in it together and we only have so many options, and I think it’s going to be this way for a few more months. (We’ve got to) deal with it, and get better.”   Greene has taken this time under quarantine to be proactive in contacting colleges, including an innovative way to show coaches her skills while remaining in isolation at home.   For other athletes around the state who’ve already been through the recruiting process, the potential loss of a full spring season means a missed last opportunity to leave a legacy their senior seasons.   Ryan Calvert, a senior pitcher and heavy hitter for La Plata High School in Charles County, Maryland, baseball, was touted as a potential Major League Baseball draft selection following his spring season. In light of potential financial ramifications of the postponement of the season, the MLB is discussing shortening this summer’s draft from 40 rounds to as few as five.   “It would’ve been nice to be drafted this year, but I really want to go to college and play baseball there and get my education,” Calvert said. “I’m preparing for both so I don’t want to leave any options out.”   Fortunately for Calvert, if high school sports aren’t resumed this spring, he’ll end his high school career as a state champion after leading his team to the 2A title on the mound against Middletown, in Frederick County, Maryland, last May.   “It was fun watching him grow. He’s always been big for his age but wasn’t always very athletic. To watch his athleticism catch up to his baseball IQ and ability has been a lot of fun to watch,” said La Plata head coach John Childers, who’s coached Calvert the last six years. “And to not be able to cap it off, fortunately, he got to win a state championship on the mound last year, but it’s hard for him to not to get that chance to do it again.”   Other high school athletes weren’t so fortunate to get that chance — at all.   Such was the case with Gilman High School senior Dylan Walters, who said he’s been dreaming of the chance to play No. 1 singles on the tennis team. After making varsity as a freshman, Walters has progressed up the depth chart to earn the spot his senior season.   Walters was nearly the No. 1 singles player for Gilman, in Baltimore, his junior season, but classmate Nick Boucher overcame him in the final match during tryouts. This spring, however, Walters said head coach Steve Krulevitz sat him down and said how proud he was of his hard work to secure the top spot for a team that has won the last six state titles.   “It’s a real honor to play No. 1 singles for Gilman, and I didn’t get to do that,” said Walters, who will play at Brandeis University next year. “It’s honestly devastating.”   At Baltimore’s Boys Latin High School senior lacrosse attackman Brendan Grimes hoped to get another year of crucial development before heading to play for nearby Johns Hopkins University after missing his junior season from a back injury.   “I felt that great feeling a lot coming into senior year,” Grimes said. “Unfortunately, that was taken away. For next season, to complete a full season would be great for me to get that confidence under my belt again.”   Grimes said he worked hard last year in physical therapy and did constant back and core exercises to get back into shape, something that helped him land a spot on the USA Under-19 national team roster. Now, he’s hoping to use the same patience to continue to work on his game so he’s ready for the next level.   For Ella Mannix, a senior lacrosse midfielder for Boonsboro High School headed to play at Salisbury next year, hoped-for milestones like reaching her 100th goal and making another run to the 1A championship seem all but gone with the current status of the pandemic. She said she’s been working since her freshman year to be nominated for the Player of the Year awarded by her local Hagerstown, Maryland, paper, The Herald-Mail.   Boonsboro lost in the state championship Mannix’s sophomore year before losing to the same side, Patterson Mill, in the semifinals in 2019. Mannix said she was hoping for a chance to lead her team to another postseason run.   “We had workout plans set and wanted to stay in shape so we can come back the same place we were when we got off these two weeks, but when they said the schools are being closed another four weeks it just kind of went downhill honestly,” Mannix said before it was announced schools would be closed until at least May 15. “It’s just really sad for all of us because it’s the whole season we’re missing out on that we had a lot of high hopes for.”   For high school coaches like Rodriguez and Gonzaga College High School assistant athletics director and head men’s lacrosse coach Casey O’Neil, they said it’s now about trying to maintain a positive mentality and keep in touch through weekly meetings.   Rodriguez said his assistant coaches at Georgetown Prep started a weekly baseball trivia night on Zoom, with the seniors dividing the squads into eight teams to compete. He said it’s a fun way to stay connected.   O’Neil’s Gonzaga, in Washington, D.C., has also kept in touch with weekly Zoom chats and through a workout program that each player sends out to the team, organized by jersey number.   When Gonzaga lacrosse learned their season was suspended, they were getting ready for  practice, planning to review a scout report the day before a game against rivals Georgetown Prep. After the news, O’Neil gave the seniors three options: go home right away, play an intrasquad basketball tournament, or scrimmage with teams made up of Gonzaga players from Maryland and Virginia.   The seniors chose the latter two options, taking every last minute to stay at the school with their team before leaving for a future of uncertainty.   “The guys used up all that time,” O’Neil said. “Once we played that game I had an emotional talk with them about the unknown and that they’re cared about if they need anything. They didn’t want to leave the field. They wanted to hang out and be together.”

Gov. Larry Hogan Sends President Trump Letter To Coordinate State Use Of Federal Labs For COVID-19 Testing
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan wrote to President Trump on Tuesday to accept Trump's offer to allow the state of Maryland to utilize federal labs for COVID-19 testing and request guidance on how to move forward with "this important federal-state collaboration,"

ANNAPOLIS (WJZ) — In the back and forth between Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and President Donald Trump, the governor has made his next move in working to get more testing in the state of Maryland.   Gov. Larry Hogan wrote to President Trump on Tuesday to accept Trump’s offer to allow the state of Maryland to utilize federal labs for COVID-19 testing and request guidance on how to move forward with “this important federal-state collaboration,”    “Maryland is fortunate to have a plethora of federal installations with the potential to play a critical role in increasing our testing capacity, including Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Detrick, Fort Meade, the National Institutes of Health, and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,” writes Governor Hogan. “These federal labs can be key to our utilizing the 500,000 tests we recently acquired from South Korea and our comprehensive recovery plan to get Marylanders back to work as safely and quickly as possible. ”     We are ready and eager to move forward on the White House's offer to utilize federal labs for  #COVIDー19   testing.   Gov. Hogan has asked Pres. Trump for guidance on how we can work with his team to get this done.  https://t.co/Y2SbfiImEl   — Mike Ricci (@riccimike)  April 21, 2020     This comes after the governor’s announcement that the state had received half a million COVID-19 tests from a lab in South Korea, a move done in part with the help of First Lady Yumi Hogan, who is Korean-born and the first Korean-American first lady in the U.S.   “These federal labs can be key to our utilizing the 500,000 tests we recently acquired from South Korea and our comprehensive recovery plan to get Marylanders back to work as safely and quickly as possible,” writes Governor Hogan. “I was grateful to hear of your generous offer to allow the State of Maryland to access these federal labs for our testing. I am writing today to personally thank you and the Vice President and to request guidance on how we can immediately proceed on this important federal-state collaboration.”   He notes in the letter that the leaders of Maryland, Virginia and Washington, DC wrote to the president directly on March 15 asking for a federally-supported testing site in the region.   He also added Vice President Pence’s voicing on a call with U.S. governors on Monday that Maryland is “fortunate to have a plethora of federal installations with the potential to play a critical role in increasing our testing capacity,”   This includes Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Detrick, Fort Meade, the National Institutes of Health and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.    Gov. Larry Hogan went on a number of morning talk shows Tuesday  to defend his decision to  buy 500,000 coronavirus test kits for Maryland  after  President Donald Trump called him out  for not knowing his state’s testing capability during a press conference Monday.   Trump singled out Hogan for purchasing the tests from South Korea for $9 million and not understanding the state’s testing capabilities.   CORONAVIRUS LATEST:   Gov.

‘I Prayed About It’: Restaurant Owner Sells Her Car To Cover Employees During Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
A restaurant owner who had to shut her doors and layoff most of her staff when the coronavirus pandemic hit Georgia has sold her car so she can pay her employees.

SMYRNA, Ga. (CBS Local)  — A restaurant owner who had to shut her doors and layoff most of her staff when the coronavirus pandemic hit Georgia has sold her car so she can pay her employees.  Vittles Restaurant  is a fixture in Smyrna, serving good old southern food for more than three decades. Charity Salyers, who purchased the restaurant last year, she says things were just picking up until the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to temporarily close.   “A lot of our clients are elderly, they come every day, sometimes twice a day, and they depend on us,” she told  WAGA .   Her loyal customers urged Salyers to do curbside pick up. But even so, business fell off sharply.   “I’ve had to cut my staff back from 10 to 12 people per day to 2 people plus me,” she said.     When a restaurant owner was faced with closing down, she decided to trade in her ride to keep her doors open and continue to pay her employees.  #CobbCounty   #Smyrna   #Business   #Food   https://t.co/9HL60Mcm2H   — MDJ Online (@mdjonline)  April 21, 2020     Salyers says while she didn’t have the money to pay her employees, she couldn’t let them go hungry.   “I was kind of stuck against a wall so I prayed about it and then went and sold my car,” Salyers said. “It was a Mustang GT 5.0, a very nice candy apple red.”   The money Salyers got from selling her 2016 Mustang will be enough to help pay the bills and pay her workers for a couple of months, she told  Cobb Business Journal . Now Salyers says she’s just hoping things get back to business as usual soon.   “I just pray that something happens soon and we can reopen society,” she said.   In addition to keeping her restaurant afloat, Salyers is also raising funds to help healthcare workers, children and the elderly who live in the area.

‘It Looks Like A Ghost Town’: Baltimore’s Penn Station Quiet Amid Massive Drop In Amtrak Ridership Due To Pandemic

Nationwide, Amtrak ridership is down 95 percent. Baltimore's Penn Station has also seen a major drop in traffic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Air travel isn’t the only form of transportation seeing major drops in ridership amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Nationwide, Amtrak ridership is down 95 percent. Baltimore’s Penn Station has also seen a major drop in traffic.   “It looks like a ghost town to me,” said Mary Delina Jones, who boarded a train Tuesday to Charlotte, North Carolina.

Hice is considered an essential employee so he continues to make the trek into DC each day.   “Some people are able to work from home,” he said,” but my job — I’m hands-on, so I need to be there.”   Thanks to the pandemic, the nation’s eighth-busiest train station looks nothing like it. More than a dozen MARC trains out of Penn Station are suspended until further notice due to the pandemic.   “It’s just going to be shocking because I never imagined it could be so empty,” Jones said.   The remaining passengers are now required to wear masks. Amtrak employees systemwide are also now wearing masks.   Hice said he’s not scared to travel now but he will be once trains start to get crowded again.   “If we’re not ready to go back, as far as the circumstances, of course I’m going to be afraid because we’re back to the norm –back to all the people, back to the crowds,” he said.

UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (WJZ) —  A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland Tuesday accuses the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections of failing to take appropriate action to slow the spread of the coronavirus at the county’s jail.  Eight detainees, some of whom have medical conditions like asthma or bronchitis, are suing the department’s director, Mary Lou McDonough, saying there is an “uncontrolled outbreak” of COVID-19 in the Prince George’s County Jail and officials have “failed to take appropriate action in response.”   The group is asking a court to order the corrections department to increase cleaning in the jail; provide detainees individual supplies of soap, paper towels and cleaning supplies; provide personal protective equipment for inmates and jail staff and provide adequate medical and mental health care to prisoners.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Allowing Salons, Barbers To Stay Open For Essential Workers Only
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan is now allowing the state's barber shops and salons to stay open to service essential personnel only during the coronavirus pandemic.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan is now allowing the state’s barbershops and salons to stay open to service essential personnel only during the coronavirus pandemic.  Last week, some licensed beauty professionals called on the governor to let them stay open, with safety precautions in place.   The guidance on the order now says that while barbershops and salons are required to generally stay closed, they can provide services to essential personnel under certain conditions.   The barber/salon may only provide services to customers on an appointment basis, and walk-ins are not allowed. They also can only have one customer in the establishment at a time.   They also can only service employees who are required by their employer to have certain “grooming standards,” and the customer must have written documentation of the employer’s standards. This could include a letter from the employer or a copy of the employer’s policy establishing the standards.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Closings & Cancellations In Baltimore, Across Maryland   What Is A Coronavirus?   The Symptoms Of Coronavirus And What You Should Do If You Feel Sick   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland     The new guidance also requires the customer and barber/salon staff to wear face coverings unless it would be impossible for the services to be performed with a face covering on.   Then, after each customer, the staff must clean and disinfect the area where they performed services in accordance with CDC and the Maryland Department of Health guidelines.   READ MORE: What does “essential” mean in Maryland under Gov. Hogan’s stay-at-home executive order?    The barber/salon must also get phone contact information from each customer. If any staff test positive for COVID-19, they must tell all customers promptly who was serviced at their establishment in the 14-day period before the date the establishment staff gets test results.   So will this help barbers/salons across the state?   Barber Steven Rowell, the owner of Hairway to Steven in Towson, said it’s a baby step in the right direction, but not nearly enough.   “It’s better than nothing at all,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be able to cover my BG&E and telephone.”   Neha Gupta is the owner of NEHA threading salon and spa in Pikesville. She said with the restrictions there won’t be enough work to bring back her 17 employees.   “It is only a one-on-one basis and the business will be slow,” Gupta said. “(Employees) are actually making more money staying at home through unemployment.”   It’s a similar story at Sam’s Barbershop and Styling in Lutherville.   Current owner Mark McBain said if he brings back his 12 employees, even for a couple of hours a week, they’ll lose their unemployment benefits.   Instead, McBain decided to man the shop on his own, giving haircuts to essential employees free of charge.   “I just felt like I needed to do something,” McBain said.

Baltimore Mayor Jack Young announced Tuesday that the city is opening another testing site in the city at the Rawlings Conservatory.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore Mayor Jack Young announced Tuesday that the city is opening another testing site in the city at the Rawlings Conservatory.  The Druid Hill testing site off Beachwood Drive will also be a walk-up testing site, but a doctor’s note will still be required to get tested as well as an appointment through the state’s CRISP system.   This is the second community testing site in the city, and the mayor said a third one is on the way.   The city has seen a 21 percent increase in cases since Friday, Young said.   The press conference was interrupted by a  group of protesters that shouted at officials and honked car horns .   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     These community sites, allow residents to receive access to COVID-19 closer to home, and will alleviate strain on our hospital systems and clinics that are also operating testing sites,” said Dr. Letita Dzirasa, the city’s health commissioner. “We look forward to announcing additional testing sites in the days and weeks to come. Residents are encouraged to call their physician who can make an appointment.”   Residents without a primary care provider can contact 211 for a coronavirus symptom assessment or to speak with a medical professional.   Officials also mentioned the expansion of the city’s food distribution to provide a total of 2.5 million meals, 70,000 grocery boxes and up to 12,000 household grocery supplements over the next two months.   WJZ also heard from Henry Raymond, the city’s chief financial officer, on Tuesday. He said there is a current year-end shortfall of about $42 million. The pandemic has resulted in a significant economic downturn for many businesses, and he said he doesn’t expect to recover this funding in the short term.   “What we don’t want to do is use the city’s budget stabilization reserve, commonly known as the rainy-day fund, to fund these activities that can and should be funded through other federal sources,” Raymond said.   But the city has applied for funding through the federal CARES Act, which should be distributed this week.   Raymond also said the city is trying to avoid layoffs and they’re now talking to the local unions about how exactly they can do that.

10 Baltimore City Council Members Call On Orioles To Pay Concessions Workers For Missed Games During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
Baltimore City Council members are calling on the Orioles to support the 700 Delaware North concessions workers at Camden Yards who have been laid off without pay while the MLB season is delayed during the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore City Council members are calling on the Orioles to support the 700 Delaware North concessions workers at Camden Yards who have been laid off without pay while the MLB season is delayed during the coronavirus pandemic.  “These are hard times for all of us. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat not only to our health, but also to our economic well-being,” said Councilwoman Shannon Sneed. “We all have to be in this together and this means checking on Baltimore City residents and even providing extended pay and other resources to the workers of many of our great businesses in Baltimore City. Once this is over, Baltimore will be stronger and better than we have ever predicted.”   Council members John Bullock, Kristerfer Burnett, Mary Pat Clarke, Zeke Cohen, Ryan Dorsey, Bill Henry, Danielle McCray, Sharon Green Middleton, and Leon Pinkett III joined Sneed in writing to Peter Angelos, owner and chairman of the Orioles. The letter reads:     “We write as City Council members because our city and our country are in a moment of crisis. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not only put the health and safety of our entire city at risk, but also put thousands of Baltimore residents out of work. This includes the 700 concessions workers at Camden Yards.   Mr. Angelos, you have always been a friend to working people and organized labor. Through your law firm you represented working people to ensure that their medical issues were paid for. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike you refused to blame players and refused to field replacement players.   In 2015, when our city was in another moment of crisis, the Orioles did the right thing and paid these workers for games missed as a result of the widespread protests following the funeral for Freddie Gray. We call on the Orioles to once again be a leader in our city today and again pay workers while the MLB season is delayed.   We applaud the Orioles and the MLB for making the difficult decision to delay the start of the season. We also applaud the Orioles for publicly committing to make $1 million available for Camden Yards workers. We would like to make sure, however, that food and beverage concessions workers employed by Delaware North are included in this and paid for missed games.   We are all die-hard Orioles fans and love the team in good times and in bad. Now, we need the Orioles to support concessions workers at Camden Yards who are incredibly vulnerable to sudden loss of income. If Delaware North will not step up for their employees, Baltimore residents, than we hope that you will. We hope the Orioles will support these workers by continuing to pay Delaware North so that it can pay employees and provide continued health insurance benefits for missed games to help these workers survive in this difficult time.”     For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Response: Lawmakers Want Trump To Order GM To Reopen White Marsh Plant To Make Ventilators
.W
Maryland's Democratic lawmakers in Washington are calling on President Donald Trump to order General Motors to reopen its plant in White Marsh to produce ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  Maryland’s Democratic lawmakers in Washington are calling on President Donald Trump to order General Motors to reopen its plant in White Marsh to produce ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In a letter to the president Tuesday, Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin and Reps. Dutch Ruppersberger, Jamie Raskin, David Trone, John Sarbanes, Anthony Brown and Steny Hoyer all urged Trump to use the Defense Production Act to force GM to reopen the plant.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The letter reads in part:   “On April 8, GM received a contract to build 30,000 ventilators under the Defense Production Act. It is unfortunate that the Defense Production Act was not invoked months ago so that these ventilators could be rolling off the line now, since COVID-19 has been a public health emergency since the end of January. Maryland now has over 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of April 20. As numbers continue to rise across the state and region, reopening the White Marsh plant will put high-skilled workers back to work and ensure that ventilators will be available and easily accessible in an area with multiple hotspots.”   READ MORE: Baltimore GM Plant To Close On May 3   The lawmakers also sent a letter to GM Chairwoman Mary Barra asking her to reopen the plant, which closed nearly a year ago.

Study Finds No Benefit, Higher Death Rate In Patients Taking Hydroxychloroquine For COVID-19
.W
Coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine, a treatment touted by President Trump, were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take the drug, according to a study of hundreds of patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centers.

(CNN) —  Coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine, a treatment touted by President Trump, were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation and had higher deaths rates compared to those who did not take the drug, according to a study of hundreds of patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centers.  The study, which reviewed veterans’ medical charts, was posted Tuesday on  medrxiv.org , a pre-print server, meaning it was not peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia.   In the study of 368 patients, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate.   “An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs,” wrote the authors, who work at the Columbia VA Health Care System in South Carolina, the University of South Carolina and the University of Virginia.   Researchers also looked at whether taking hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, had an effect on whether a patient needed to go on a ventilator.   “In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,” the authors wrote.   There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19, although research is underway on many drugs.   Hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades to treat patients with diseases such as malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Trump has touted the drug as a “game-changer” for COVID-19 and said hydroxychloroquine shows “tremendous promise.”   Physicians have warned that while Trump is enthusiastic about the drug, it still needs to be studied to see if it works and if it’s safe.   In  another recent study , researchers in France examined medical records for 181 COVID-19 patients who had pneumonia and required supplemental oxygen. About half had taken hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital, and the other half had not.   It found there was no statistically significant difference in the death rates of the two groups, or their chances of being admitted to the intensive care unit. However, it found eight patients who took the drug developed  abnormal heart rhythms  and had to stop taking it. This research also has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.

FDA Authorizes New Coronavirus Test With At Home Sample Collection
.W
The Food and Drug Administration issued an authorization for LabCorp to test self-collected samples using their Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kit.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday the authorization of a new diagnostic test for COVID-19 that has an at-home sample collection option.  The test kit, produced by LabCorp, includes a specific Q-tip type cotton swab that allows patients to collect their own sample. The FDA’s ruling, which is a re-issuing of the emergency use authorization for LabCorp’s test, will continue to permit testing of these self-collected samples.   “Throughout this pandemic we have been facilitating test development to ensure patients access to accurate diagnostics, which includes supporting the development of reliable and accurate at-home sample collection options,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D in a statement. “The FDA’s around-the-clock work since this outbreak began has resulted in the authorization of more than 50 diagnostic tests and engagement with over 350 test developers. Specifically, for tests that include home sample collection, we worked with LabCorp to ensure the data demonstrated from at-home patient sample collection is as safe and accurate as sample collection at a doctor’s office, hospital or other testing site. With this action, there is now a convenient and reliable option for patient sample collection from the comfort and safety of their home.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The authorization by the FDA is only for this specific test and is not a “general authorization for at-home collection of patient samples using other collection swabs, media, or tests, or for tests fully conducted at home.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Calls President Trump ‘Confused’ While Defending Decision To Buy 500K Test Kits From South Korea
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan went on a number of morning talk shows Tuesday to defend his decision to buy 500,000 coronavirus test kits for Maryland after President Donald Trump called him out for not knowing his state's testing capability during a press conference Monday.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan went on a number of morning talk shows Tuesday to defend his decision to  buy 500,000 coronavirus test kits for Maryland  after  President Donald Trump called him out  for not knowing his state’s testing capability during a press conference Monday.  Trump singled out Hogan for purchasing the tests from South Korea for $9 million and not understanding the state’s testing capabilities.   “Some of the governors, like as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list, he didn’t understand too much about what was going on,” Trump said. “The governor of Maryland could have told Mike Pence because that’s a lot of money. No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea, I think he needed to get a little knowledge who would have been helpful.”   Trump also added he felt Hogan acquiring the tests was unnecessary.   “No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a better knowledge, that would have been helpful,” the president told reporters at his Monday night briefing.   President Trump appeared to confuse having access to those tests with the ability to process them. He repeatedly said Maryland had enough resources to process tests at federal labs in Maryland, which Hogan said the state was not allowed to use.   “We now have the tests. They have the labs, and that should be a great solution,“ the governor told MSNBC.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Hogan said he’s not sure why the president lashed out at him, saying that the governors had a great call Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and that he thanked Pence and the president’s coronavirus task force for their help. He said on that call they told the governors about federal labs in each state.     “We were very familiar with all of the labs in our state already but the list they provided us was all federal labs, which I pointed out, and which we hadn’t had any access to,” Hogan said on “The View.” “But our discussion really was about test it wasn’t about lab so the president seemed to be a little confused yesterday in his press conference I have no idea what set him off.”   Hogan said the president asked all the governors to get our own tests.   “He said we needed to be leading and we needed to be stepping up and the governors needed to go get their own testing. That’s what we’ve done,” he added. “The president was not on that call, and I was somewhat, you know, taken aback by his, his sort of fighting attacks on me yesterday I have no idea what that was about.”   CORONAVIRUS LATEST:   Gov. Larry Hogan, ‘The View’ Host Whoopi Goldberg Share A Laugh About Maryland Police Department’s Viral Post On Man Checking Mail Without Pants   On “Fox & Friends,” Hogan reiterated that he was just following the president’s previous directives about reaching out and finding your own ways to test.   “I’m really not sure what he was upset about,” Hogan said, adding that on Monday the governors got a commitment that states can use federal labs, they previously didn’t have access, to for coronavirus testing.   “We already knew where the state labs were in our state but the list that they gave us was mostly federal labs, which we’ve been attempting to use for more than a month now,” Hogan said on Fox News. “So, we got a commitment yesterday from the Vice President and from the President that we can now use federal labs, which is terrific.”   On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Hogan was asked “Would there be have been an easier way to get testing to your state is the president right about that? Are you missing some knowledge, and if there was an easier way what would it be?”     “Well if there was an easier way we certainly would have taken it, you know, every governor in America has been fighting to get tests since the beginning of this crisis and it’s probably been the number one problem in America throughout this entire crisis,” Hogan said. “You know, the President said that the governors are on their own and they should really focus on getting their own tests and that’s exactly what we did. His message changed yesterday, I’m not sure why, but we were very pleased that we had such tremendous success this half a million tests that we secured is more than the top four out of the five states in America have done.”   Hogan said the president has since approved state use of Maryland’s federal labs and sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday afternoon thanking him for doing so.   As for when Hogan said Maryland will reopen, he said he’s listening to the experts’ guidance on that, which is when any state or region has seen a decrease in new cases for at least 14 days.   He also called out the president for encouraging protesters to reopen states including Maryland. Over the weekend, protesters flocked to Annapolis to protest the governor’s stay-at-home order and other executive actions related to the coronavirus.   READ MORE: Dozens Rally To ‘Re-Open Maryland’; No Arrests Made   “I think it’s unhelpful. It doesn’t make any sense, the mixed messages we are getting out of the president,” Hogan said on “The View.” “He basically was encouraging people to violate his own federal policy so I don’t think it was helpful.”   Maryland saw a decrease in number for two consecutive days over the weekend, but then numbers increased Monday.   As of Tuesday morning, there are more than 14,000 cases of COVID-19 in the state and nearly 600 deaths.   At his Tuesday press briefing , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Hogan was resourceful in getting tests from South Korea, but he should not have had to get that assistance from another country.     NY Gov Cuomo praises MD Gov. Larry Hogan for "thinking outside the box" when buying coronavirus test kits from South Korea but pushes the federal government to figure out international supply issues rather than have 50 states fending for themselves  https://t.co/UXPuQyaR0P   pic.twitter.com/dy9Vm42HeZ   — CBS News (@CBSNews)  April 21, 2020     For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A group of protesters shouted and honked their car horns while Baltimore Mayor Jack Young and local officials tried to address residents on the latest on the city’s coronavirus response.  A man wearing a mask stood in front of a sign that said “homeless can’t stay home” and asked for the mayor’s help to address the coronavirus epidemic among the city’s homeless population.     City press conference interrupted by protesters asking for permanent housing for the City’s homeless community & that it ensure social distancing practices against  #Covid19 .  “We desperately need your help,” one protester says.  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/Yv9H0MuznX   — Rachel Menitoff (@RachelMenitoff)  April 21, 2020         “I do not want to die this way,” the man said, urging the city to look at how dangerous it is to house the homeless in shelters and to find them more permanent housing.   “These people in shelters and encampments are dying,” said Mark Council with Housing Our Neighbors.     Demonstrators say the "Homeless can't stay home" and need the City to move all homeless residents out of shelters and into permanent housing.

When the protestor finished, the mayor began to speak again, but then was cut off by honking car horns.   The mayor continued to speak over the car horns. The demonstrators said they honked 32 times to represent the 32 homeless individuals who have died in Washington, D.C., and New York.   When asked after the press conference, how the city is working to protect the homeless from the virus, the mayor asked if reporters had seen the previous plan released on March 25.   “The city has relocated about 160 homeless individuals who were, who were 62 and over, who were not impacted by COVID,” a city official said. “So they’ve been relocated into hotel settings to help isolate them and protect them from the spread of the virus. The city also created another shelter environment and moved 155 homeless individuals out of existing shelters into a much larger facility to allow for more social distancing in that facility as well as the remaining shelters.”   RELATED STORIES:     Baltimore To Screen Shelter Residents For COVID-19, Opening Isolation Sites For Homeless Quarantining   Vulnerable Baltimore Homeless Residents To Be Moved To Motels   Baltimore’s Homeless Population Moving To Motels For Proper Social Distancing   Men’s Homeless Shelter In Baltimore Relocated Due To Coronavirus Pandemic     “The city also opened an isolation location, which was a motel starting on March 20.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) — It is Earth Day 2020! 50th Earth Day.   Due to lack of flights, and cars, the air has never been this clean. Over the I-95 corridor, the air is 30 percent to 40 percent cleaner than before the COVID world. “CBS This Morning” ran a report about LA having some of the cleanest air in the country now, when previously it was horrible.   It is pretty clear that when you remove man’s fingerprint from the planet, the Earth is better off. And these are lessons that need to be carried forward in the post-COVID world, to some extent anyway.   Today is crystal clear, and on the chilly-breezy side. But the sun is shining, spring is blooming and Earth Day 2020 is a beautiful one.

Club Source: Orioles Paying Baseball Op-Employees Through At Least May 31; Third-Party Concessions Workers Not Getting Paid

The Baltimore Orioles will commit to paying baseball operations employees through at least May 31, a club source tells WJZ.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Baltimore Orioles will commit to paying baseball operations employees through at least May 31, a club source tells WJZ.  Earlier Tuesday, ten Baltimore City Council members  called on the team to pay these workers  for missed games during the coronavirus pandemic.   “These are hard times for all of us. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat not only to our health, but also to our economic well-being,” Councilwoman Shannon Sneed said. “We all have to be in this together and this means checking on Baltimore City residents and even providing extended pay and other resources to the workers of many of our great businesses in Baltimore City. Once this is over, Baltimore will be stronger and better than we have ever predicted.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The MLB postponed its season after concerns over the coronavirus continued to grow in March.   Last month, all 30 baseball teams pledged $1 million each to support their workers. That plan, though, doesn’t include the hundreds of concessions workers who are not getting paid.   One of those workers, Kareem Boy, has been in love with Orioles fan for five-and-a-half seasons. Now, he and more than 700 of his coworkers are missing out on their paychecks.   “Whether the team is doing bad or great, we have to be there with a smile on our face,” he said, “and that’s what we do: we take pride in that and we thought they would take pride in us.”   Instead, Delaware North, the company that runs concessions at Camden Yards, had made Boy feel like he’s unappreciated, he said.   In a statement, Delaware North said:   “We understand the hardship this unprecedented situation has caused our dedicated part-time employees in Baltimore and around the country. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that the impact of the crisis on the hospitality industry will be deeper and longer-lasting than anticipated. It has left nearly all of Delaware North’s businesses temporarily closed and is causing significant financial losses. We have been forced to place more than two-thirds of our full-time employees on temporary leave, and thousands of part-time employees cannot be scheduled for work as a result of the shuttered operations.   “We greatly appreciate all of our employees and hope they remain healthy and safe as we look forward to resuming operations and welcoming them back at the appropriate time.”   Boy said he now hopes the Orioles will step up to the plate to help him and his co-workers.   “Times are really hard right now and we just need them to help us out,” he said.

Doctors Try To Untangle Why They’re Seeing ‘Unprecedented’ Blood Clotting Among COVID-19 Patients
.W
Doctors say it's hard to know exactly what's behind what they're seeing with Covid-19 patients in the ICU.

(CNN) —  Dr. Kathryn Hibbert’s Covid-19 patient in the intensive care unit was not doing well. As his blood pressure plummeted, she tried to insert an intravenous line into an artery in his wrist.  A blood clot clogged the tubing.   Frustrated, Hibbert tried again with a new needle. A blood clot clogged up that line as well.   It took three tries to insert the IV.   “You just watch it clot right in front of you,” said Hibbert, director of the medical intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s rare to have that happen once, and extremely rare to have that happen twice.”   Hibbert and other doctors are finding that some patients infected with the novel coronavirus have a propensity towards developing blood clots, which can be life-threatening if the clot travels to the heart or lungs.   “The number of clotting problems I’m seeing in the ICU, all related to Covid-19, is unprecedented,” Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, a hematologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, wrote in an email to CNN. “Blood clotting problems appear to be widespread in severe Covid.”   Laurence and his colleagues looked at autopsies on two patients and found blood clots in the lungs and just beneath the surface of the skin, according to  a study  published last week. They also found blood clots beneath the skin’s surface on three living patients.   In the Netherlands, a study found “remarkably high” rates of clotting among Covid patients in the ICU.   An international consortium of experts from more than 30 hospitals gathered to consider the issue. Their conclusion: It’s unclear exactly why, but coronavirus patients may be predisposed to having clots.   “This is one of the most talked about questions in Covid right now,” said Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of the division of critical care medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.   At Montefiore, they’ve started to put all Covid-19 patients on low doses of blood thinners to prevent clots, Gong said.   Not all hospitals have taken that step — but they’re still concerned.   “It’s out of the norm, and we’re wondering, are blot clots one of the reasons why these patients are dying,” said Dr. Todd Rice, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.   ‘Alarming’ rates of blood clots   Being in the intensive care unit, sick and lying still, can be a perfect storm for blood clots for any patient.   “Even before Covid, we’re on high alert for suspicion of clots in the ICU because they’re at high risk,” Gong said.   Even so, doctors have a hunch that Covid patients might be clotting even more than other ICU patients.   The Dutch study of 184 patients in the ICU with Covid-19-related pneumonia found that more than 20% were having clotting issues.  A study  of 81 similarly ill patients in Wuhan, China, found a 25% incidence of clots.   Dr. Behnood Bikdeli, who helped coordinate the international coalition of physicians looking into the clotting issue, called those numbers “alarming.”   Bikdeli, a cardiovascular medicine fellow at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said there are three major reasons why Covid-19 patients might have an especially high risk of clotting.   One is that vast majority of patients who become severely ill with coronavirus have underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. These patients — whether they have coronavirus or not – have a higher tendency to clot than healthy patients.   Second, one way coronavirus can kill patients is through a “cytokine storm,” where the body’s own immune response turns on itself. Patients experiencing that storm, because of coronavirus, influenza, or any other reason are at a higher risk for clotting.   The third reason is that there could be something about the novel coronavirus itself that’s causing clots.   Doctors say it’s hard to know exactly what’s behind what they’re seeing with Covid-19 patients in the ICU.   “My gut tells me there are probably a subset of Covid patients who have really abnormal clotting behavior, that this is happening more frequently than we would expect it to,” said Hibbert, an instructor at Harvard Medical School.   She quickly added, though, that doctors’ gut feelings are “notoriously misleading” and that studies need to be done to get to the bottom of exactly how common clotting is among coronavirus patients.   A tricky fix   Fixing these clotting issues can be tricky.   While a low dose of blood thinners to prevent clots is generally considered low risk, that might not be enough to prevent clots in some patients. Giving larger doses, however, could make a patient bleed excessively, which can be deadly.   That leaves doctors in a conundrum. Some patients might benefit from larger doses of blood thinners because they’re very sick with Covid-19, and their blood tests show they have elevated levels of  D-dimer , a substance that indicates they might have clotting issues.   Doctors at Harvard have proposed doing a large study on blood thinners for these patients, Hibbert said.   “There’s a crying need for these kinds of rapid trials,” Gong said.   Laurence, the hematologist at Weill Cornell, said since treating clotting can be so tricky, he wants to figure out what’s causing the clotting in the first place.   “We’re trying to shut off what’s causing it,” he said. “There’s overexuberant clotting going on with Covid patients, and we’re trying to keep ahead of it.”   While studies sort this out, doctors are being extra vigilant with their Covid-19 patients.   Hibbert described how a nurse recently had to constantly administer a blood thinner called heparin to a Covid-19 patient while the patient was undergoing kidney dialysis, because clots kept clogging up the tubing in the machine.   “We had the nurse at the bedside pushing heparin to keep the machine from clotting off. That’s very rare,” Hibbert said.   Hibbert said she awaits the day when a study will nail down how often Covid-19 patients are having clotting issues, and what to do about them.   “This is one of the many challenges in taking care of critically ill patients and trying to decide if what you’re seeing at the bedside is rare and happening by chance, or if it’s part of a larger pattern that could change your practice,” she said.

‘Everything’s Just Turned Upside Down, And I Don’t Like It,’ Says Dakota Kai, WWE NXT Superstar
.W
NXT is still going strong despite coronavirus limitations, but WWE and Dakota Kai have been forced to reexamine every aspect of performing.

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —  Dakota Kai is 8,000 miles from home, living in a foreign country, and having to fight with her best friend at work. Any semblance of the daily routine that she had grown accustomed to has been erased by the global disruption of a deadly pandemic.  Life as an  NXT  Superstar is almost always chaotic, but the current circumstances are taking it to next level insanity.   “Everything’s just turned upside down, and I don’t like it,” Kai said. “I want things to go back to how they were.”   Don’t we all?   Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, WWE and its talent have become the flag bearers for the “whatever it takes” and “the show must go on” mentalities. Pushing through has meant abandoning packed arenas and instead broadcasting on closed sets with only essential personnel allowed in the building.   It has also meant adhering to safety measures put in place to limit the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Talent and crew are required to wear masks at all times except for when they are performing on camera. Superstars must also be examined and cleared to wrestle by the medical staff each night. Anyone exhibiting symptoms of an illness will be sent home.   Despite the precautions, an alleged employee  anonymously levied a public complaint  against WWE with the Orange County, Florida Board of County Commissioners this week. The employee, known as “John,” claims it is impossible for talent and crew to maintain social distancing even with the sanitary precautions. The employee further stated that he feared he would be fired if he expressed his concerns with “higher-ups” and requested the county shut down production despite the company being deemed an essential business last week. The essential designation enables WWE to continue taping shows while a statewide stay-at-home order is in effect.   The wrestling giant responded by saying there was no truth to the allegations.   “These accusations aren’t true. Employees know they can confidentially go to Human Resources, not the public,” a statement from the company read. “Notwithstanding the appropriate protocol, no one would be fired if they were uncomfortable with their surroundings. We’ve made accommodations for individuals upon request.”   As for Kai? She feels confident that the steps being taken by WWE provide adequate protection.   The massive changes and empty stands are forcing Kai to completely rethink the way she performs. She is still playing to the audience, but it’s one watching at home. It’s all very strange to focus on something so invisible when you’re used to having the instant feedback of crowd reaction.   Normally fans will cheer if they like something and boo if they don’t. In most cases, wrestlers are good with either response. It’s silence that they dread because it means they’re not connecting with the crowd. But for more than a month, silence is all there has been. Every match is a guessing game and all Kai and others can do is hope they’re on the right track. The soonest any of them can get feedback now is by checking Twitter after a match.   Kai is currently in the midst of an in-ring feud with former bestie, Tegan Nox. Some fans believe with the chemistry they display their battles could potentially grow into a long-running classic akin to the Johnny Gargano-Tommaso Ciampa saga.   The two will write the next chapter in their feud on Wednesday night’s live  NXT  broadcast when Kai teams up with Raquel Gonzalez to face Nox and Shotzi Blackheart.   I had an opportunity to catch up with Kai as she prepares for the match to get her thoughts on the rivalry, their real-life friendship, and safety measures put in place by WWE and wrestling during a global pandemic.   >>READ:  Latest from the world of Pro Wrestling   This whole situation is incredibly weird. Your schedule must be really off from what it typically is.   It’s insane. From going to just shooting on a closed set, just the fact that we’re not in front of an audience anymore really makes you appreciate them so much more than before. It’s so difficult to do that. Yeah, it’s so strange, not traveling to do the live shows that we did anymore, or for now. Everything’s just turned upside down, and I don’t like it. I want things to go back to how they were. I never thought I’d say this, but I miss fans.   What is the biggest adjustment that you’ve had to make in terms of just being in the ring and still performing when you don’t have any of the fans there?   Focusing on the at-home audience more so than ever before. Obviously for TV, that’s already such a key thing to realize, that there’s just so many more people watching at home. But now that’s all we have. So, it’s very strange to just focus on that. It’s been quite a challenge, but we’re doing the best. I just really would like things to go back to they were, and I hope it’s not too far off.   NXT  TakeOver: Tampa didn’t get a chance to happen because of the pandemic. Would you be open to the idea of having a fan-less TakeOver, or is that something you feel like should be reserved for when you can get that packed arena again?   Honestly, it all depends on how much longer things will be the way that they are now. I’m not against it, obviously giving the fans at home forms of entertainment is key right now. I would obviously love, love, love for us to be able to do TakeOvers with the packed arenas again, but who knows how long this is going to be going on. I would not be against that idea at all, doing a crowd-less TakeOver at some point. … [It is] very feasible during this time, very doable what they did with two days of WrestleMania. I think it’s definitely achievable.   Talk a little bit about the chemistry that you and Tegan have. There are certain people that get put in the ring together and just work so well.    We started in WWE at the same time. We literally landed upon moving here at the airport at the same time, and she had the same rental car. So, I sort of knew her before I did Shimmer, and she did a Shimmer show, and that’s the only time I ever met her. I never worked her before or anything. So we were kind of still strangers to one another per moving here, but we became fast friends. It was crazy. We did everything together.   I think that the chemistry stems from a lot of trust. You have to have that in the ring, and we definitely have that. So yeah, I think if you have a connection with someone outside the ring, it just really does carry over to in the ring where you have to put your life basically in the other person’s hands a lot. So yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.   Being such close friends, were you disappointed then when the storylines shifted and you turned on her?   It was a little sad. I think that our tag team could’ve gone a lot further than it did because it just felt like we were able to work together as a tag team for such a short time before WarGames happened and then that storyline began.   But in saying that, being able to be with one of your best friends in the ring as opponents is one of the greatest things, because you’re able to tell this amazing story and really, really trust the other person. So, we were so into all of the stories, and we wanted to be able to put out some of the best wrestling we could. So yeah, it’s a double-edged sword.   Let’s talk a little bit about some of the safety measures that have been put in place. I believe Drew McIntyre told  TMZ  that he basically has a locker room to himself and maybe the talent has to wear masks. Are you feeling comfortable when you’re taping the shows?   I feel so comfortable taping all the shows that there have been a lot of measures being taken during this time. So yeah, all of us have to wear masks, besides from when we’re actually taping the matches, that’s definitely a need. Before we do anything, we have to check in with medical to make sure that we’re able to perform.   If anyone’s unable to, they get sent home. They can’t be involved or at the set at all. They film with only essential personnel. So, anyone that doesn’t need to be there isn’t, and they make sure that there’s only a certain number of people in the area where we film or the makeup area at any one time, so yeah.

That’s Not Yellow Paint, It’s Pollen In Waters Along Assateague Island

Spring has sprung in Maryland and even during a coronavirus quarantine pollen continues to be a problem for allergy sufferers.

ASSATEAGUE ISLAND, Md. (WJZ) —  Spring has sprung in Maryland and even during a coronavirus quarantine pollen continues to be a problem for allergy sufferers.   The officials at Assateague Island National Seashore posted a stunning photo on Facebook that captures what looks like yellow paint in the water and along the beach.   What’s surprising is all that yellow is actually pollen, pine pollen to be exact.   “What in the world happened here?!?!?! Did someone SERIOUSLY dump yellow latex paint in the Sinepuxent and it washed up on the bayside of Assateague Island?!?!? Of course not! All of the yellow you see in this picture is actually pine pollen!,” park officials posted.     Pine pollen is considered large and should be too heavy to travel through the air, officials said.   “However, to compensate to its large size, pine pollen has two air capsules that are attached to either side of the pollen grain itself; if you were to look at pine pollen under a microscope, it would look like a Mickey Mouse head with the ears being the capsules,” officials continued in the post. “The air capsules reduce the weight of the pollen grain and make it easier to travel though the air. When the pine pollen settles out of the air and onto the water, the same air capsules make the pollen grains buoyant, so they float on the water. As the wind blows toward shore, the grains are pushed into one another and creates what appears to be a latex paint like mass along the shoreline.”   That’s a lot of pollen!

University Of Maryland Professor Explains How Face Coverings Prevent Spread Of COVID-19

Whether they’re medical grade or homemade, face masks are the new norm.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Whether they’re medical grade or homemade, face masks are the new norm.  It’s been five days since Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order requiring Marylanders to wear face masks in grocery stores and on public transportation.   When you talk or cough tiny spit droplets escape your mouth.   These droplets can carry the virus, and a mask can contain them, or at the very least, reduce the distance they travel.   “Even if it’s not not very good at stopping the droplets, at least it will have some effect on slowing down the puff of air that would carry them,” Dr. Donald Milton, a Professor of Environmental Health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Even with face coverings it’s important to practice social distancing. It’s also important to make sure the room you’re in has good air circulation   “Then distance almost doesn’t even matter because what you’re putting into the air will just build up and begin to fill up the whole space,” Dr. Milton explained.   Dr. Milton added that  face masks, distance and ventilation will be essential for keeping people safe as we work to regain some form of normalcy.

Local Girl Scout Troop Giving Back To Front Line Workers Battling COVID-19 Pandemic

In the midst of a global pandemic, our heroes are often on the front lines of the battle: first responders, grocery store workers, mail carriers and many more.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  In the midst of a global pandemic, our heroes are often on the front lines of the battle: first responders, grocery store workers, mail carriers and many more.  But, for more than 100 years, there has been one group of young women on the front lines always finding a way to make a big impact. They’re our Girl Scouts.   “I love being a Girl Scout because I help the world become a better place,” Wren Morgan, Girl Scout of Troop 744, said.   As the coronavirus pandemic crumbles through cookie sales and field trips right in the middle of the busy season nationwide, Girl Scouts are still finding a way to provide sweet treats to those on the front lines of the pandemic.   “Girl Scouts are resilient,” Violet Apple, CEO of Girl Scouts of Central Maryland, said.   The girls are all about spreading positivity.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Troop 744 out of Elkridge, Maryland, is giving back to the community by showing appreciation for our first responders.   “When all this happened, all this crisis, we didn’t know where all those cookies were going to,” Morgan said. “So we decided we were going to give it to hospitals.”   Mercy Hospital was first on the list to receive dozens of Girl Scout cookies during the week of the shutdown.   “It makes me feel happy that they’re still helping people and they will be happy when they receive their cookies,” Morgan said.   In the next two weeks, Troop 744 plans to make another delivery to the Children’s National Hospital in D.C.   “This shows their character and their confidence that they can make a difference in any circumstance,” Apple said.   In the meantime, Girl Scout Troops will continue meeting virtually, and proving to the world that even the youngest minds can come together to lend a helping hand during these unprecedented times.   “I think our girls are just showing that this pandemic will not beat them,” Apple said.

Johns Hopkins University Considers Pay Cuts, Furloughs, Layoffs To Offset Losses Related To COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
Like many academic institutions Johns Hopkins University is looking to offset losses related to the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Like many academic institutions Johns Hopkins University is looking to offset losses related to the coronavirus pandemic.  “Ever since we decided to end our on-campus instruction for undergraduates, graduate, and professional students; to suspend the lion’s share of our lab-based research program; and to halt elective medical procedures, the university has suffered a dramatic and unprecedented contraction. More than 1,200 employees have been rendered idle because they are unable to perform their duties. Many more are working off-site but at significantly reduced levels of productivity,” a letter to the university community reads.   In a letter, university president Ronald J. Daniels expressed how they will help mitigate a projected loss of $100 million in fiscal year 2020 and $375 million in fiscal year 2021 if no actions are taken.   “The magnitude of the challenge we face is unlike any we have experienced in recent memory, but it is one that we can and will overcome. It will require difficult sacrifices from all members of our university community, including a one-year suspension of contributions to employees’ 403(b) retirement plans, a freeze on base salaries, restrictions on hiring, and a pause on most capital projects. Provost Sunil Kumar and I are reducing our salaries for the next fiscal year by 20 percent, and deans and university officers are cutting their pay by 10 percent. These and other actions are set forth in detail below,” Daniels stated.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The university did not reimburse students for tuition but did reimburse students for the remainder of the spring semester of housing, dining, and student service charges at a cost of $12 million.   “We also extended more than $5 million in unanticipated financial support to students and their families during this difficult period, including in the form of direct emergency grants for essential needs, continuity of wages for suspended on-campus employment, and relief from summer work requirements as a part of financial aid,” Daniels said. “We know we will see even greater demand for investment in student aid in the coming months, and it is essential that we continue to meet our promise to make a Hopkins education as accessible as possible.”   Here’s a list of some of the ways the university will recoup its losses:     In fiscal 2021, the university will enact a one-year suspension of employer contributions to 403(b) and 457(b) retirement accounts   In recognition of the sacrifices that will be required across the university, Provost Kumar and I will reduce our salaries by 20% in the next fiscal year, and our deans and university officers will reduce their salaries by 10%.   The university instituted a general prohibition and review of base salary increases effective April, and we will continue this hold for the next fiscal year (ending in June 2021).   Staff promotions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require the written approval of the dean or division director.   For staff positions —the university is restricting hiring through fiscal 2021.   For academic positions —the deans will review all approved or planned faculty searches with the provost (including those with donor support) to jointly determine which should continue and which should be paused.   The university has halted new capital projects over $100,000 through FY21, including information technology and equipment purchases, with exceptions granted for projects that address critical life safety or systems issues or meet an urgent strategic need.   Due in part to the response to COVID-19, recent reductions in non-personnel expenses are expected to continue into the next fiscal year.     Read the letter to the JHU community here.

LAUREL, MD. (WJZ) —  As the numbers come in and as Prince George’s County collects more data, County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said they are noticing men, in particular, are succumbing to the coronavirus, and that it may be due to men waiting too late to get treatment.  “We’re very concerned that men have been waiting. Dr. Carter tells me that we ought to really send home the message that if you’re having symptoms do not wait, because we were so distressed to learn that at least a couple of our residents died at home last week, because they waited to late to seek medical treatment,” the county executive said.

Study: Majority Of Americans Now Fearful Of Shopping Inside Grocery Stores

60 percent of American consumers are now "fearful" to shop at a grocery store due to the cornonavirus, according to a new report.

(CBS Local)  — 60 percent of American consumers are now “fearful” to shop at a grocery store due to the coronavirus, according to a new report.  C+R Research  recently surveyed more than 2,000 consumers to find out if Americans have changed their grocery shopping habits due to COVID-19.   It found 60 percent feel a sense of panic or anxiety when they shop. 45 percent disinfect the groceries they bring them home.   More than one-third of shoppers said more should be done to protect consumers from COVID-19 and half said grocery stores need to do more to properly protect their employees.     Survey: 60% of US shoppers “fearful” of shopping inside grocery stores:  https://t.co/ywa9En5TMe   pic.twitter.com/KW10rYG9VU   — The Spoon (@TheSpoonTech)  April 21, 2020     46 percent of grocery shoppers said the pandemic has led them to buy items in bulk, although 89 percent believe limits should be placed on items.   73 percent of the respondents are actually shopping less in person and when they do venture out, they tend to go more in the morning than the evening.   Before the pandemic, consumers took 2.3 weekly trips to the grocery store. Now, they average only one trip per week.   Not surprisingly, grocery home deliveries have more than tripled.   C+R’s survey  also found consumers are spending an average of $25 more on groceries per week during the pandemic. And nearly half of respondents said their use of restaurant, meal kit or grocery delivery services has increased.

‘I Felt Like I Was Sent Two Angels’: Facebook Group Pairs Up Medical Workers With RVs To Self-Isolate During Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Families of healthcare workers and first responders are getting help as hundreds of RV owners are lending their rigs to people on the frontlines of the cornonavirus pandemic so they can isolate but still be near loved ones.

HILLSBORO, Mo. (CBS Local)  — For Sarah Willie, a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a nursing home in Hillsboro, Missouri, coming home after a long day had become almost as stressful as work itself.  Willie lives with her fiancé and her ailing mother in nearby House Springs. Her mom suffers from underlying medical conditions that along with her age, make her highly susceptible to the novel coronavirus.   “She suffers from congestive heart failure and lung problems and she’s a severe diabetic so she has amputations and all those fun stuff,” she told CBS Local’s  Katie Johnston . “You know, I may be able to fight [COVID-19] off, but she won’t. She can’t,” Willie said.   To protect her mom, Willie considered leaving the house and staying somewhere else for the duration of the pandemic. Then she came across  RVs 4 MDs , a Facebook group that connects frontline health care workers and first responders with free mobile housing — typically recreational vehicles and campers — so they can stay close to home while still distancing from their families.   RVs 4 MDs was  launched  on March 24 by Emily Phillips, a mother of three from Celina, Texas. She had posted on Facebook asking if anybody had an RV that her family could rent so her husband, an ER doctor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, could  safely self-isolate  at their home.     "Anything just to ease their minds a little bit." A Facebook group is connecting health care workers needing to self-isolate with people willing to offer their campers.  https://t.co/VFa3Rpzwx2   — KDKA (@KDKA)  April 10, 2020     “Within five minutes of my post, somebody offered their RV and I couldn’t believe it,” she recalled. “Her name was Holly Haggard, and she offered it for free and I thought that was amazing. So my husband and I drove over there, got it and on the way home, somebody else said that they needed an RV. And so I said to Holly, ‘let’s make this a thing.'”   With a network of volunteers spanning across the nation, Phillips says RVs for MDs has made approximately 900 matches and counting. The group, which has grown to an astonishing 30,000 members, has also expanded internationally to operate in places like Dubai and Australia.   “It’s unbelievable,” she says. “I’ve never seen so many selfless people get together to help a mission, especially with all the anxiety and depression and people that have been having it come together to join forces with us to help this, I’ve never seen anything blow up like this. It’s been divine.”   When Willie posted her request, she was prepared to wait a week or two to hear back. But within 48 hours, she was matched with a spacious, luxury RV donated by Marty and Donna Bondurant, a local couple.   “Complete strangers, total strangers and I feel it was a godsend in a way. I felt like I was sent two angels,” she says. “They have gone over the top for me, over the top.”   Willie moved in just before Easter.   “I get to sleep in a nice, big king-sized bed. I get food to eat. I get a washer and dryer to wash my clothes and dry my clothes. I mean it’s luxury in a sense because it’s better looking than my house, honestly, it’s so nice.”   The only downside for Willie is that the RV is so big, she’s not able to park it in front of her home and thereby see her fiancé and mother on a regular basis. Instead, she’s staying about 20-30 minutes away on the Bondurants’ property.   Willie says she feels a bit lonely, but says she’s staying strong by keeping busy and maintain a regular schedule an regiment.   “If it wasn’t for Marty and Donna for saving her life by offering me a place to go…” she tearfully says. “It has impacted my life. This group really has changed my life for the better.”

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh joined 18 other attorneys general in urging 3M to do more to combat inflated prices of N95 respirators and other desperately needed personal protective equipment.  The coalition highlights that, while 3M has committed to maintaining prices for N95 respirators, distributors of 3M products and others in the marketplace have been charging unconscionable prices.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In the letter, the coalition said:   “It is crucial that hospitals, healthcare workers, and first responders have access to these masks and other PPE and that they are able to obtain them at reasonable prices so that they can care for patients with COVID-19 as well as others needing medical attention.”   The attorneys general ask 3M to take the following actions, in addition to the steps they have already taken, to work towards eliminating price gouging of PPE:     Continue to publish policies prohibiting price gouging by its distributors and cease doing business with those distributors who violate them.   Create a database of 3M’s inventory of N95 respirators for government officials and healthcare providers; and,   Make transparent how inventory is being distributed and how orders are being filed.     In addition to Maryland, the letter was signed by the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia.

.W
Gov. Larry Hogan said he will announced Maryland's Roadmap To Recovery plan on Friday. This plan will mark how Maryland will reopen after the coronavirus pandemic led to a stay at home order to slow the spread of the illness.

LAUREL, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan said he will announced Maryland’s Roadmap To Recovery plan on Friday. This plan will mark how Maryland will reopen after the coronavirus pandemic led to a stay at home order to slow the spread of the illness.  “On Friday, we will be introducing our Maryland strong roadmap to recovery,” Hogan said. “A safe, effective, and gradual plan which will allow us to reopen to rebuild and to recover just as soon as it is safe for us to do so.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This recovery plan, which has been developed over many weeks in consultation with our coronavirus response team of doctors and public health experts, has four essential building blocks that are needed to be solidly in place before we can be in position to begin lifting restrictions,” he continued.   Hogan said in order to reopen the state, there would need to be a larger testing capacity and on Monday he announced Maryland bought 500,000 coronavirus testing kits from a South Korean lab.   The first step in the four-step plan to reopen the state is to expand the state’s COVID-19 testing capacity, which was increased by that purchase.   Second, is to increase the hospital surge capacity, Hogan announced Wednesday that  Laurel hospital was reopened with 135 beds.    CORONAVIRUS LATEST:     Gov. Hogan Reopens Laurel Hospital To Treat COVID-19 Patients   Do Not Wait’ | Prince George’s County Executive Says Men Are Waiting Too Late To Seek Treatment For COVID-19     Third is to increase the supply of PPE or personal protective equipment to protect frontline health care workers and first responders. And fourth is to have a robust contract tracing operation.   “Our teams have been making significant progress, and each of these criteria,” Hogan said. “Maryland has successfully expanded our testing capability by over 5,000%. Over the past month, we’ve completed more than 76,000 tests to date.”   Use cutting edge robotics, University of Maryland Medical System built their capacity in order to handle the ability to handle 20,000 tests per day with a $2.5 million investment from the state.   As for being prepared for a hospital surge, in addition to reopening Laurel Hospital the 250-bed field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center is completely staffed and set up. The state will begin admitting patients who no longer require hospitalization, but need a place to complete their care and fully recover.   The state also opened the first beds at Adventist Fort Washington Medical Center in Prince George’s County and are adding additional beds, including ICU beds, there and at UM Prince George’s Hospital Center in Cheverly.   They are also expanding capacity with 22 response tents across the state, including at Doctors Community Hospital, in Lanham, Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Clinton, Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring and Washington Adventist Hospital in White Oak.   There also adding 100 additional beds at Jessup and at Hagerstown to address the needs of corrections and detention centers.   “We’re now on track to not only reach, but actually exceed our goal of 6,000 additional beds by reaching a surge capacity of more than 6,700 new beds in the coming weeks,” Hogan said.   As for the PPE, Hogan said a multi-agency task force is working “literally around the clock” focused on the issue.   Hogan said the group has acquired 5.9 million surgical masks, including 1 million masks from Korea, 2.3 million surgical gowns, one million N95 masks, 1.1 million face shields and additional 1,000 ICU beds.   Finally, the governor addressed the state’s plan for contact tracing.   The state already has 250 contact traced working with local and state health departments across the state. On Wednesday morning, Maryland contracted National Opinion Research Center or NORC, operated by the University of Chicago with offices in Bethesda to be able to trace 1,000 cases per day. A new website, COVID link, will help in monitoring and collecting information about positive COVID-19 patients and who they may have come into contact with. It will use data from the CRISP system which is used to help patients make appointments for testing.   Hogan said the plan will “lead us safely out of this pandemic into a brighter and more hopeful future.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Seafood Industry Visa Fix In Question Due To COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
With the aid of lawmakers, seafood businesses in Maryland, Virginia, Alaska and North Carolina last month won federal approval of an additional 35,000 visas for non-immigrant workers, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.

WASHINGTON (AP) —  With the aid of lawmakers, seafood businesses in Maryland, Virginia, Alaska and North Carolina last month won federal approval of an additional 35,000 visas for non-immigrant workers, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.   Within days, the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets the seafood industry supplies.   Some seafood operations let employees go, while others have hired fewer people than they would in a more typical season.   John Martin, owner of the Martin Fish Co. in Ocean City, Maryland, told Capital News Service that a large percentage of the firm’s business is in the retail sector, including market and restaurant sales. Due to the virus, Martin Fish has been able to open its retail store.   “We are now in the process of figuring out how to open with the safety of our workers and our customers in mind,” Martin said. “Currently, we have had to lay off a significant number of employees that are directly relating to those end-user groups.”   He added that this has been a lesson for his company: within weeks a global issue can affect the world food markets and he needs to be more prepared for that in the future.   Jack Brooks, president of J.M. Clayton Seafood Co. in Cambridge, Maryland, explained that the seafood industry is a seasonal business and the coronavirus has hit the hardest during the industry’s prime time.   “We were planning on hiring between 65 to 70 workers for the season, but now that the markets have gone down we hired about 25 people,” Brooks said in an interview with CNS. “We sell our seafood to restaurants and with the restaurants being closed that has really hurt our business. We are taking this pandemic really seriously and are hoping that by next year we will be able to recover from the hard hits we have taken.”   The $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month includes $300 million for the nation’s fisheries industry.   The Maryland congressional delegation sent a letter on April 13 to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chris Owen, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, requesting that the aid include companies that process fish products for restaurants and grocery stores.   Fishing and processing seafood is a more than $600 million industry in Maryland.   “A new economic analysis found that Maryland’s oyster aquaculture operations contribute an average of $9 million per year to the state economy and have grown by nearly 25 percent annually since 2012,” the lawmakers wrote. “However, that growth, as well as the mostly small and family-owned businesses that comprise Maryland’s seafood industry, is threatened due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.”   Whenever the seafood industry can go back to relatively normal operations, company officials say the long-term labor problems will remain, despite the visa relief given just before the pandemic struck.   Foreign seasonal workers come to work for the seafood industry each year with the help of the H-2B visas. Such workers are high in demand as these companies would not survive without them.   A study conducted by Maryland’s Best Seafood found that without the additional H-2B visas released each year, seafood processors would lose close to $49 million in sales. Maryland would lose 914 to 1,367 jobs and the overall hit to the state’s economy could reach $150 million.   A letter to the Department of Homeland Security signed by seven senators, including Maryland Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, called the visas a “critical matter.”   “Local seafood businesses earn their livelihoods based on perishable products and need H-2B workers to harvest and process their respective seafood products so they can sell those products,” the senators wrote. “If these local businesses lose a customer base one year, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to come back into the industry.”   “The DHS grants a maximum of 66,000 visas to foreign nationals each year through the H-2B visa program, which is operated like a lottery,” the lawmakers said. “The workers are spread half-and-half to assist non-agricultural companies across the country between the first and second periods of the year.”   If companies don’t win workers through the lottery, they could be forced to stop business operations unless the DHS grants more visas for seasonal workers to shuck oysters, process crabs and harvest salmon.   Maryland Delegate Chris Adams, R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot & Wicomico, said last month he still had concerns over the recurring shortages of seasonal workers in the industry, which he called “gut-wrenching.”   Van Hollen responded to Adams’s concerns, saying he realized “it’s hard when it seems like we’re doing this on a short-term basis rather than having a long-term solution.”   Van Hollen, Cardin and Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, said they are working together to find this permanent fix.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Hospitals Across Maryland Brace For Potential Surge Of COVID-19 Patients

Hospitals across the state are bracing for a possible surge in patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Hospitals across the state are bracing for a possible surge in patients as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.  As coronavirus cases climbed past 14,000 Wednesday, it’s preparation — not panic — inside hospitals statewide.   “We’ve had about four weeks to prepare,” Dr. Stuart Bell, Chief Medical Officer of MedStar Good Samaritan and MedStar Union, said.   At a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Larry Hogan said Maryland is making progress, increasing the number of hospital beds including statewide.   To combat a spike in cases, Gov. Hogan said they’ve built nearly 22 surge response tents outside hospitals.   They’ve also reopened Laurel Hospital in Prince George’s County and turned the convention center in Baltimore City into a makeshift care center that’s now open with 250 beds and a medical staff on standby to treat patients who no longer require hospitalization   University of Maryland Medical System officials said as the numbers grow, hospitals need to get ready.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “As we expand our testing capacity outside the walls of the hospital, that will also allow health systems to better prepare the needed resources for what we have coming as we get on the backside of this peak,” Mohan Suntha, CEO of UMMS, said.   Hospitals statewide are feeling the pressure, but Dr. Bell said the slower climb in cases recently has given them enough time to prepare   “It enabled us to start developing our plans,” Bell said.   He said doctors and healthcare workers go through emergency preparedness training and they can quickly deploy resources from one hospital to another if necessary.   So, in extreme situations like this, they’re ready.   “We’ve been able to manage almost all of it so far,” Bell said.

ANNAPOLIS (WJZ) —  Maryland’s number of coronavirus cases went up again overnight into Wednesday, and now nearly 14,800 people have tested positive and 631 people have died, more than Washington, D.C. and Virginia combined.  According to the state health department, there are now 14,775 cases of COVID-19 in the state and 631 people have died from the virus, along with 67 probable deaths reported.

There are currently 1,432 people hospitalized, with 905 in acute care and 527 in intensive care.   Gov. Larry Hogan has long been concerned about hospitals being able to keep up with a surge in patients, but the opening of the field hospital at the convention center this weekend may bring some relief.

Instead of 250 contact tracers, the state will now have as many as 1,000 and the information will be monitored on a new platform called COVID Link.

A North Carolina firefighter who can't be home with his family due to possible exposure to the coronavirus is sharing a touching moment with his family.

HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. (CBS Local)  — A North Carolina firefighter who can’t be home with his family due to possible exposure to the coronavirus is sharing a touching moment with his family.   In a photo posted to social media on Friday, the Huntersville Fire Department said one of their first responders on coronavirus quarantine was photographed when he stopped by his home and kissed his young daughter through a closed window.   “THIS is what a first responder, hero, looks like. This is a picture of one of our firefighters (earlier this month) while he was on quarantine,” they wrote. “He stopped by his home to give his daughter a quick kiss through the window.”     HFD said the unidentified firefighter was one of several first responders ordered to quarantine themselves following possible exposure to the coronavirus. Thankfully, none of their firefighters ended up testing positive for COVID-19 and returned to duty.   The fire department also urged residents to do their part and #StayHomeForUs during the pandemic.   “We ask that YOU stay home, and do your part to #SocialDistance for as long as it takes,” the post continues. “We remind you, that the men and women of HFD (all 119 of them, across all 4 fire stations) are not full-time employees. They are citizen volunteers and or part time employees. They’re busy…but they love our community and will always be here for you – regardless.”

More than one-fifth of the nation’s federal workforce lives in Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser sent a joint letter urging the Trump administration to continue to keep telework policies in place for the federal workforce amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  More than one-fifth of the nation’s federal workforce lives in Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.   Gov. Hogan and Northam, and Mayor Bowser wrote:   “While of course any essential employee should continue to report to work, we know that a continued federal telework policy will help save lives by allowing more of our region’s 360,000 federal employees to work from home.   “This is a hard balancing act between ensuring the continuation of critical government functions and ensuring the safety and well-being of employees. But we know that the Trump administration can similarly make these appropriate judgements, and we hope the federal telework posture is reflective of our own local operating statuses.”   Gov. Hogan and Northam, and Mayor Bowser wrote the letter to Acting Director of U.S. Office of Personnel Management Michael Rigas.   Gov. Hogan said the National Capital Region leaders have collaborated and coordinated throughout the coronavirus pandemic in a number of areas.   “We encourage the Administration to help ensure the safety of the federal workforce and our residents as we work together to fight this pandemic,” Hogan, Northam and Bowser added. “Failure to do so could lead to a rise in cases and delay our ability to re-open the region.”   The  full text of the letter is available here .

Experts Expect Possible Coronavirus Impact On Meat Supply Chain

As the coronavirus disrupts the meat supply chain, this might be a good time to stock up, experts say.

WATERLOO, Iowa (CBS Local)  — As the coronavirus disrupts the meat supply chain, this might be a good time to stock up, experts say.  An explosion of COVID-19 cases is forcing some meat packing plants to shut down, further straining the U.S. meat supply chain and raising fears of potential shortages.   “Meat shortages will be occurring two weeks from now in the retail outlets,” Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services, tells  Bloomberg . “There is simply no spot pork available. The big box stores will get their needs met, many others will not.”   Tyson Foods on Tuesday said it is closing the company’s largest pork plant, which has 2,800 employees and processes 19,500 hogs a day in Waterloo, Iowa. The shutdown followed an outbreak of at least 180 COVID-19 cases there.   “Despite our continued efforts to keep our people safe while fulfilling our critical role of feeding American families, the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns has resulted in our decision to stop production,”  said  Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats.   The closure follows other major shutdowns at plants run by Smithfield Foods, JBS USA, and other companies that prop up the country’s meat supply.   Processing plants can be a breeding ground for the virus because many workers spend their day side-by-side.   “We are very close. We can’t use a social distance at that place,” said a man who recovered from COVID-19 who works at Smithfield Foods in South Dakota, where almost 900 employees have tested positive.   The disruptions are cascading through meat supply chains and causing “weird” dislocations for prices, Bloomberg reports. Finished products are surging, while farmers are getting paid much less for animals.

In The Match: Champions For Charity, Woods, Mickelson, Brady and Manning will play a golf match to benefit COVID-19 relief

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —   The Match: Champions For Charity  is officially on, though the specifics remain fuzzy. Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning will compete at a yet-to-be-determined time, on a yet-to-be-determined course under a yet-to-be-determined set of rules. We do know that the sport will be golf and all donations and fundraising will  benefit COVID-19 relief .  The event has been  rumored  since last month, and was announced Wednesday afternoon. The date will likely be some time in mid-to-late May, the course will probably be in Florida and the  matchup  seems destined to be Woods-Manning vs. Mickelson-Brady. Confirmation is forthcoming, and all plans depend on official approval from the proper authorities.   Woods and Mickelson  matched up over Thanksgiving a year and a half ago at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. Mickelson prevailed after a four-hole playoff to take home $9 million. This year’s event, which could be the first major sporting event since coronavirus put all sports on indefinite hold, will serve a more worthy cause.   Tiger and Phil, two of golf’s best ever, have been competing against each other on the PGA Tour for decades. They have 20 major championships and 126 Tour wins between them. Their teammates in this charity event — Brady and Manning — have their own storied history of gridiron accomplishments, with eight Super Bowl titles between them.   If the possible May dates hold, the event is likely to be the first major sporting event during the pandemic. A significant sports-starved viewing audience will likely tune in, though in-person viewing may very well be limited to participants and those necessary to stage and broadcast the event.   The implementation of the needed social distancing measures could create a template, or best practices, for other sporting events to follow. At the very least, such attempts will help the PGA Tour when (if) it resumes in June with the Charles Schwab Challenge.   The Match: Champions For Charity , if the parties involved manage to pull it off, will provide some hope that a post-quarantine world is within reach. And late May is only a month away. The circumstances that would allow this event to happen, however, seem much further off. But at least it’s something.

‘It’s Been A Big Change’: Maryland Wineries Deal With Increased Online Orders, Limited Foot Traffic

Industries are getting creative when it comes to finding ways to keep their doors open during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wineries and vineyards are no different.

HYDES, Md. (WJZ) —  Industries are getting creative when it comes to finding ways to keep their doors open during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wineries and vineyards are no different.  As the buds begin to break on the vines at Boordy Vineyards, the rest of the facility sits quiet.   “On any given weekend, if it’s nice weather, we have 1,000 people here. Bluegrass music, wine tastings tours. So it’s a big change for us,” said Phineas Deford with the winery.   Now several weeks into the state-mandated shutdown, the vineyard has had to change the way it operates.   The tasting room is now filled with boxes, and packing tape as sales shift to online.   “What we generally see in terms of sales volume online in a year, we’re seeing in a matter of weeks,” he said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Being a staple in the Maryland wine community for 75 years is coming in handy as they rely heavily on brand loyalty for retail sales.   “They’re not spending a lot of time in stores, so they’re going in and asking for what they know and fortunately for us, Boordy Wine is something they know,” Deford said.   To keep all of its full-time staff employed, the winery has gotten creative by training tasting room and sales staff on how to work the vineyard.   “Our staff is ready, they’re excited it’s a change for them. They know it’s not permanent so everyone’s really excited to get out there and start working,” Deford said.   So while their sales may be down, at Boordy Vineyards, they prefer to focus on the positives.   “To be able to have enough work to keep people employed, the fact that people are still looking for Boordy Wines, sales are not what they were but they’re still strong, all of that is just wonderful,” he said.

David DeBoy's "'Baltimore Hon' In Quarantine" music video has garnered more than 100,000 views on Facebook and YouTube combined.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  It’s safe to say we can use a laugh these days, and one comedian has created a video that will give any Baltimorean a chuckle.  David DeBoy’s “‘Baltimore Hon’ In Quarantine” music video has garnered more than 100,000 views on Facebook and YouTube combined.   DeBoy, the brains behind “Crabs For Christmas,” said he got bored in quarantine a few days ago and decided to get creative.   Among the lyrics:   “The governor’s on the TV and he’s closing all the bars   “And we’re gonna have to leave because of that Coronavirus!   “And we gotta leave now because we’re all being corn-teen!   “So I went home, home, home, home to my Baltimore hon, Baltimore hon.”   DeBoy’s ‘Baltimore Hon’ is his wife Joellen. Luckily, she had the ‘hon’ wear on hand so she could be part of the fun.   As for the musicians and other players in the video, even though they’re also in quarantine — or is it corn-teen? — they still decided to get in on the fon after DeBoy reached out to them.   “I have a little experience writing funny songs about Baltimore, so I thought I’d try my hand on it,” DeBoy sais. “Luckily, I had an instrumental version of a song that I had written and put out on an album in 2011 called ‘I’m In Love, Love, Love With a Baltimore Hon’ and I changed the line to home, home, home, then tried to figure out how to make a video of it.”   DeBoy asked his friends to send him videos of them doing the things he sings about and they didn’t disappoint.   If DeBoy looks familiar, he has a large following thanks to his position as the master of ceremonies, judge and emcee each year at “Hon Fest” in Hampden.

Coronavirus Latest: Pre-Existing Conditions Put Communities Of Color At Higher Risk Of Catching COVID-19

Statistics show African Americans are disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus, and new research found certain pre-existing conditions may put them at higher risk.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Statistics show African Americans are disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus, and new research found certain pre-existing conditions may put them at higher risk.  While many people immediately think of pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, there are other elements to consider, experts say, including where someone lives.   Despite Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay at home order, Penn North was bustling Thursday. People were coming and going and dozens of commuters streamed off buses. For many, it’s not a matter of choice but of necessity.   Dr. Rashawn Ray, a sociologist at the University of Maryland College Park, said not everyone is able to work from home.   “Social distancing becomes a privilege, the whole thought of being six feet away, if you’re living in a Baltimore housing complex and all of a sudden you have to go to work, you’re going to pass 10 to 20 people presumably before you even leave your complex, so what that means is your exposure if high,” Ray said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In Maryland, while African Americans make up 30 percent of the population, they account for 37 percent of all coronavirus cases and are dying at a higher rate.   Those numbers in Maryland and elsewhere galvanized celebrities, who performed on a BET special Wednesday to drive home the severity of the virus.   Groups like the  Baltimore Arabbers  and NAACP have also gone through hard-hit communities offering information about how to prevent the spread of the virus.   Sandi Thomas lost both her mother and sister to COVID-19. Both died days apart at a Baltimore hospital.   “My mother and my sister are gone,” she said. “They were doing everything they were told to do and yet it still got them.”   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still gathering statistics on why COVID-19 is hitting communities of color especially hard.   Ray, meanwhile, said the increased number of testing sites and medical resources in African American communities shows leaders are trying to make adjustments to meet the needs of those who are more at risk.

Coronavirus Response: Kennedy Krieger Among Local Health Systems Using Telehealth Amid Pandemic

Doctors said telehealth services will continue to be offered to Kennedy Krieger patients even after the coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Kennedy Krieger, like many other hospitals in our area, is now treating many of its patients with telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Journey Jeffries has been undergoing occupational therapy and speech therapy at Kennedy Krieger after she was born prematurely.   But when COVID-19 started spreading, her treatment couldn’t continue normally, so they turned to telehealth services.   “It’s very interactive, myself and my husband can participate in therapy with the therapist,” Journey’s mother, Ahsha, said. “Since it’s via telehealth, it’s like you’re involved in the therapy session with your kids.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Fortunately, Kennedy Krieger was already doing telehealth with military families for three years. It is now doing 1,200 TeleHealth sessions a day.   “That really allowed us to respond immediately to COVID-19, such that we were able to build on that foundation and essentially immediately convert our care over to a telehealth model,” behavioral psychologist Dr. Jennifer Crockett said.   For Journey, that means getting active.   “Journey usually starts out occupational therapy with yoga,” Ahsha said. “She can actually see her therapist and see the activities at the same time.”   In some cases, doctors are finding that treatments are even more effective through telehealth.   “It’s more effective in certain situations if you can actually provide the care in the home as opposed to providing the care in the clinic and then having to transfer it,” Crockett said.   Doctors said telehealth services will continue to be offered to Kennedy Krieger patients even after the coronavirus restrictions are lifted.

No Need To Wipe Down Groceries Or Takeout, Experts Say, But Do Wash Your Hands
.W
Has wiping down your groceries and take-out food become part of your coronavirus survival kit? It might be time to reconsider, experts say.

(CNN) —  Has wiping down your groceries and take-out food become part of your coronavirus survival kit?  It might be time to reconsider, experts say, especially if that extra effort is adding to your daily stress. Even the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is re-emphasizing there’s no real risk of getting the virus that causes COVID-19 that way.   “We want to assure you there is currently NO evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the #COVID19,” the agency tweeted recently.   Jamie Lloyd-Smith is one of the scientists who worked on the  only study to analyze  how long SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might remain on various surfaces.   Despite the fact his research found the virus might live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and metal and plastic for two to three days, Lloyd-Smith doesn’t bother to wipe down his own groceries or takeout.   “I don’t, personally,” Lloyd-Wright said. “I treat my hands as potentially contaminated while I’m handling the groceries and unpacking them and I make sure that I wash them fully when I’m done with that process.”   Virologist Dr. John Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades, is also not overly concerned.   “Personally, we’re alternating cooking food at home and getting takeout food for a houseful of kids home from college right now,” Williams said. “And we’re not wiping down the containers from the restaurant.”   Because the odds of someone coming along and depositing enough virus on a grocery item or takeout container are pretty low, “I view it as sort of a hypothetical risk,” Lloyd-Smith said.   “So yes, I’m careful, I’ll wash my hands, but I don’t sort of regard it as glowing radioactively with virus.”   His advice might change, said Lloyd-Smith, if the person was at high risk from the virus, such as elderly or immunocompromised.   “One reasonable and easy-to-implement precaution for groceries that don’t need refrigeration is simply to let them sit for a day or more before unpacking them,” he said. “This will vastly reduce the level of any contamination that is present.”   How did we get so concerned about groceries?   The concern over virus transmission via surfaces began in late March after the study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.   “What the study showed is that under certain conditions in the laboratory, which are obviously kind of artificial, SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,” Lloyd-Smith said.   The experiment did not account for other factors that could help to inactivate the virus, such as sunlight or disinfectants or look at varying levels of virus, Lloyd-Smith said, so there’s no “magic” in the numbers they found.   Food safety expert Benjamin Chapman agreed. “There’s no magic number in this because temperature matters, humidity matters, how much virus was put there in the first place matters,” said Chapman, a professor in the department of agricultural and human sciences at North Carolina State University.   The amount of SARS-CoV-2 also diminished rather quickly over time, compared to say, a norovirus or “cruise-ship” intestinal virus, said Williams, who is chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.   In the study the virus was down “a hundred fold on cardboard in eight hours,” Williams said. “That means 99.9% of the virus was gone by eight hours, and the same is true on stainless steel and plastic.”   “The cruise ship norovirus, however, can persist for many days in an environment on inanimate objects,” Williams added. “So you could be on a cruise and have norovirus and then your cruise finishes and I get on the next cruise in your cabin and I can get your norovirus.”   Washing hands is key   If you want to focus on something that makes a key difference every time, experts say, it’s much more important to become a fanatic about properly washing or sanitizing your hands after any potential encounter with coronavirus.   Instead of worrying about how long the virus will persist and spraying everything down or wiping it down with sanitizer, you can manage this “very unlikely route with low risk and make it even lower by just practicing proper good hand washing,” said Chapman, “or using hand sanitizer once you’ve returned home from the grocery store or gotten takeout food.   “I don’t want to discount this conversation or people’s fears, but it’s almost like it doesn’t matter much as long as everyone is washing their hands,” Chapman added.   If you are still really nervous about your risk of contamination by food products, then by all means use disinfectant wipes on the outside of containers, Williams said.   “Some people want to wear a belt and suspenders to hold their pants up, right?” Williams said.   “So if people are concerned about virus transmission from groceries or take out food, just carefully remove the inside containers of food from the outer bag, throw away the outer bag and then use a little hand gel or soap and water.   “But still, the odds of getting the virus that way are very, very low,” Williams added.

‘The Nurses Are Overwhelmed’: Baltimore Nurse Heads To New York City To Treat Patients Amid Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Baltimore nurses are stepping up here in the State of Maryland to help fight COVID-19, and also, in places hit hardest by the virus.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore nurses are stepping up here in the state of Maryland to help fight COVID-19, and also, in places hit hardest by the virus.  It’s been five days on the front lines in New York City for Baltimore native and part-time nurse Darnell Jeffers.   “The needs are great here,” Jeffers said. “The nurses are overwhelmed.”   Jeffers is a full-time student but was forced to put school on hold and work extra shifts in hospitals across Maryland.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     He said that’s when he heard about New York’s desperate need for health care workers.   “When you see a nurse struggling and overwhelmed mentally, you just have to be a part of that. You have to go up and help,” Jeffers said.   On Friday, he left behind his 12 year-old-son and family in Baltimore and drove to New York City, the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic with over 145,000 confirmed cases.   Jeffers said he’s working at Bellevue Hospital, one of the busiest hospitals in the city, and nurses are doubling up on patients.   “It’s not easy because you have patients really sick,” Jeffers said. “You have to be on your a game with these patients. One slip up, you have a big issue.”   He said every day poses a new mental challenge and fear of not knowing what to expect.   “You can’t prepare for this,” Jeffers said. “We don’t know each other, but we’re brother and sisters in this fight against COVID-19 together.”   Jeffers said he is getting compensated for his time, but all of the money is going to pay for school. He said his plan is to stay until July.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Latest: More Than 45K Unemployment Claims Filed In Maryland Last Week; New Filing System Launches Friday
.W
More than 45,000 unemployment claims were filed in Maryland last week, according to state officials.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  More than 45,000 unemployment claims were filed in Maryland last week, according to state officials.  That number is down from the previous week when more than 61,000 claims were filed.   The governor’s spokesman Mike Ricci tweeted the new numbers Thursday morning.   With such an increase amid the coronavirus pandemic, the labor department has admittedly fallen behind but officials hope a new program will help them catch up.   On Thursday, desperate Marylanders showed up at the department’s offices in person hoping for help. They were greeted by a locked door.   “My first thing was to file unemployment and I haven’t heard anything since then,” said Terry Turnbaulgh, who formerly worked for Baltimore Sound Stage.   He’s one of the countless Marylanders who haven’t been able to get through to the unemployment offices.   “The first week I didn’t expect to hear anything,” he said. “The second week I tried calling them and it went straight to a busy signal.”   Secretary of Labor Tiffany Robinson said they’re “overwhelmed” by the number of new claims coming in every day.   That led them to create  a new portal for Marylanders to apply for all unemployment benefits in one place . Beginning Friday at 7 a.m., everyone will be able to file online at  mdunemployment.com , including those who are self-employed, independent contractors, sole proprietors and those with insufficient work history.   “Those people previously had to call in and we know that there’s frustration in trying to reach us,” Robinson said.   In the coming days, the department is also launching a virtual agent and an online app that filers can use to get status updates about their applications.   On Twitter Thursday night, Ricci said the updates will be a “significant step forward.”     8. We hope this will help address a lot of the concerns people have had with the filing process. There will undoubtedly still be some issues, but this is a significant step forward.

He told WJZ he’s been trying to reach someone for weeks to no avail.   “I don’t know if my unemployment is going to come in or not,” he said. “Where am I going to get my answers from?”   Robinson said the volume of calls is also taking a toll on those answering the phones.   “I’ve been in those claim centers watching our claims takers get emotional as they’re spending time with every single claimant,” she said.   For now, though, Turnbaulgh remains unsure of what’s coming next.   “I’m sad and I’m worried and I’m scared,” he said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen next; I don’t know where to go from here.”   Here’s a county-by-county breakdown of the 47,545 unemployment claims.   The highest number of claims were in Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, followed by Anne Arundel County and Baltimore city.

Coronavirus In Maryland: Two New Testing Sites To Open In Baltimore County Next Week
.W
Two new coronavirus testing sites will open in Baltimore County next week.

TOWSON, Md. (WJZ) —  Two new coronavirus testing sites will open in Baltimore County next week.  Just last week, the county opened a testing site at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium.   The Baltimore County Department of Health announced it will operate a walk-in clinic at the Liberty Family Resource Center on Mondays, and in partnership with the Maryland Department of Health, the county will operate a testing site at the Owings Mills Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program on Wednesdays and Fridays.   “As we continue responding to this pandemic, additional testing capacity is critical to keeping County residents safe and a necessary condition for opening back up,” County Executive Johnny Olszewski said. “These two new sites give us the capacity to, as they become available, perform significantly more tests in the areas of the County that have been hardest hit by the virus.”   Beginning on April 27, county residents can be tested here:      Liberty Family Resource Center, 3525 Resource Drive | Randallstown, MD 21133       Mondays by appointment only – Approximately 20 appointments per day             Maryland Vehicle Emissions Program (VEIP), 11510 Cronridge Drive | Owings Mills, MD 21117    Wednesdays and Fridays by appointment only – Approximately 75 appointments per day             Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium, 2200 York Road | Timonium, MD 21093    Tuesdays and Thursdays by appointment only – Approximately 75 appointments per day         “Testing continues to be key in containing the spread of the virus,” said County Health Officer Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch. “Staging test clinics in communities that report a high number of confirmed cases will help us identify people who need to quarantine to protect against infecting others.”   Patients must first get authorization from a healthcare provider to be tested. Once authorization is obtained, the person to be tested must schedule an appointment using the state-designated Chesapeake Regional Information System (CRISP).   Tested individuals will receive post-test instructions at the clinic and most test results will be available within two days. Persons arriving at any of these sites without an order from a healthcare provider and a pre-scheduled appointment will not be tested.   People coming for testing are asked to adhere to recommendations and safety guidelines, including wearing face coverings, observing social distancing, and following post-test instructions received at the sites.   For questions and additional information, call the Baltimore County COVID-19 Hotline seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 410-887-3816.

‘COVID-19 Caught Everyone With Their Pants Down,’ Says WWE’s Vince McMahon
.W
Coming off a strong quarter and a record-setting WrestleMania, Vince McMahon and WWE grapple with the uncertainty brought on by coronavirus.

( CBSNewYork /CBS Local) —  WWE is facing its biggest threat to date. In a world of bruising seven-foot giants and freakishly athletic strong men, it is a virtually weightless and invisible virus that is challenging every member of the roster and employee of the company.  Already the coronavirus has forced WWE to tap out of live events and body slammed the idea of holding WrestleMania in front of a packed stadium. For the first time ever, the event was held without a single fan in attendance. Millions of dollars in critical revenue that was being counted on was instead counted out of their bottom line.   There were mass talent layoffs and furloughs for employees.   Television audiences continue to erode as its live broadcasts have lost much of their sizzle because there are no cheers or jeers. There is only silence.   “There’s a lot of things to figure out in this environment,” said Vince McMahon, WWE Chairman and CEO. “It’s brand new for us and for anyone. When there’s no audience, it is a different show. A completely different show.”   During the pandemic, WWE is being forced to re-think the way its television properties are produced and to generate outside-the-box ideas to try to captivate audiences.   >>READ:  ‘Everything’s Just Turned Upside Down, And I Don’t Like It,’ Says Dakota Kai, WWE NXT Superstar   McMahon says his crystal ball is as cloudy as anyone else’s and doesn’t know when — or even  if  ­– things will return to how they once were. In short, it’s impossible to define what the new normal will look like.   But if it sounds like WWE is going down for the count, think again.   The company posted revenue of $291.0 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing a 60 percent year-over-year increase. They also logged a record number of new subscribers to the WWE Network over WrestleMania weekend. The total number of subscribers to the streaming service is up to 2.1 million, which represents a five percent increase over last year’s WrestleMania. The company declined to say how many of those are paying subscribers.   Records were also set for viewership on its digital and social platforms with 967 million video views during the week of WrestleMania.   As for the ratings of  Raw , the company’s flagship show posted a 16 percent decline in viewership during the first three months of the year, but still managed to outperform its broadcast home of USA Network which is down 29 percent during the same time, according to WWE officials.   “As far as the content is concerned [our broadcast partners] totally get that it’s not our fault,” McMahon said when asked whether he thought the company’s television properties were in jeopardy because of the lack of ratings and live crowd. “They’ve lauded what we’re doing because there is nothing out there right now… They have our back as we do theirs.”   McMahon is also confident that ratings will rebound once the audience becomes more familiar with new faces on the roster.   The company’s first quarter financials were largely unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic, because its wrath didn’t cause a seismic shift in live entertainment until mid-March. Additionally, WrestleMania did not occur until the second quarter.   McMahon gave an honest appraisal of the challenges they are facing and the road ahead.   “I think the COVID-19 stuff caught everyone with their pants down,” McMahon said.   Resuming a live touring schedule and attracting fans to arenas will be among the biggest hurdles for WWE to clear once restrictions are lifted. And there is no clear indication as to when that process could begin. Even the prospect of running another major show in Saudi Arabia as far out as November or December is in doubt.   “I don’t know when it’s going to be allowed, and I don’t know what it’s going to look like when it is allowed. I don’t think anyone does,” McMahon said. “Right now we’re just taking it month by month and continue to push it further out every month in terms of when we’re going to do this thing. I really have no crystal ball there at all.”   Still, the company has dates reserved at multiple arenas in the event they can dip their toes back into their previous business model. McMahon is also open to the idea of welcoming fans back to tapings and employing social distancing measures if permitted to do so by state officials.   >>READ:  Latest from the world of Pro Wrestling   Moving forward, finances may get a little cloudier for WWE as stay-at-home orders and restrictions on live events with large crowds drag on.   Such uncertainty is what led to the release of a large number of talents and furloughing of much of its off-camera workforce. In speaking with investors, company executives stressed that the employees had not been laid off and expect the staff reductions are a temporary measure.   With revenue from ticket sales completely dried up, the company is leaning heavily on the massive television contracts that went into effect last October. Live programming has never been more important to WWE and officials are going to great lengths to ensure the safety of its production staff and crew on the closed sets where the shows are being broadcast.   During the taping process, performers are sequestered in a hotel to limit potential exposure to COVID-19 and temperatures are checked as they arrive at the show. Anyone displaying a fever is barred from entering the premises. All employees and wrestlers are also required to fill out a form documenting whether they’ve been exposed to the virus on a weekly basis.   Additional measures include limiting the total number of people on set during the taping, cleaning the ring ropes in between matches, and frequent “pandemic cleanings” of the entire facility and mobile production trucks.   The company is also using long-lasting industrial-strength chemicals to reduce the risk of viral transmission. WWE Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy and Development Paul “Triple H” Levesque revealed the company has contracted with Allied Bio Science to apply a substance capable of continually killing viruses on surfaces for up to 120 days.   “How it was explained to me is that it acts like a sword that punctures the cell wall of the virus or what causes the virus and kills it on contact,” Levesque said.   The veteran performer turned executive added that it remains effective even if additional cleaning chemicals are applied on top of it.   “We’re doing everything we can do for safety and making sure the environment is as good as it could possibly be,” McMahon said.   Both the company and officials in Florida have recently faced criticism as the shows have continued despite the safety measures that have been put in place. McMahon says that contingency plans have been crafted and company officials have identified a number of alternate locations in multiple states to hold tapings should Florida pull the plug.   No matter how things shake out in the future McMahon says he is confident WWE will be able to adapt and continue to roll with the punches for as long as it takes.   “If anyone can figure it out, we will,” McMahon said. “We’re highly adaptable as you’ve seen through the years. Whatever happens, we’re there.”   Investors reacted positively to the update as shares jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.

UMD Researchers Studying Hydroxychloroquine As Coronavirus Treatment
.W
Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine are testing the effectiveness of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (WJZ) —  Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine are testing the effectiveness of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.  The research is part of a larger national study trying to figure out if the drug can prevent people from getting sick after being exposed to those who have tested positive for COVID-19.   READ MORE: NIH starts clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine, drug Trump called COVID-19 “game changer”   President Trump has promoted the drug as a possible treatment for the virus.   “I think we need to find out if this is a potential beneficial role of hydroxychloroquine in COVID,” said Dr. Miriam Laufer with the university.   This study is different, she said, because it looks at how the anti-malaria drug could prevent the spread of the virus rather than treating it after the fact.   The key participants will be people who either live or work with someone who tested positive.   “It may work to prevent infection in the household members,” Laufer said. “The other possibility is it may be treating the infection very early on so that the infection goes away without causing any disease, so it may prevent infection, or it may prevent people from getting sick.”   The University of Maryland is one of six schools nationwide taking part in the study. The process will be entirely remote, with participants speaking with doctors over the phone or via teleconference. Medications will then be delivered, with participants getting either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for 14 days.   Researchers will then study the effects.   With no vaccine ready for the public, experts are rushing to find scientifically-vetted options to prevent the virus.   “I am with everybody else in the world who is so eager to find a treatment for this terrible disease, and in particular a way for us to not have to live in social isolation for so long, but it’s important that we make sure that we do more benefit than harm,” Laufer said.   On Friday, the FDA issued a warning that said hydroxychloroquine should only be used in clinical trials and under medical supervision, warning not doing so could be deadly.

Md. Lawmakers Call For Families Who Qualify To Receive Additional COVID-19 Stimulus Payment As Soon As Possible

U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen joined other lawmakers in calling on the U.S. Treasury Department to ensure families who qualify receive their additional COVID-19 stimulus payment.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen joined other lawmakers in calling on the U.S. Treasury Department to ensure families who qualify receive their additional COVID-19 stimulus payment.  Under the CARES Act, families that are not required to file taxes will receive an additional $500 payment per dependent child.   In their letter, the lawmakers said, in part:   “We write to express our concern that without additional action from your agencies, many families who receive Social Security benefits and have young children may not receive the full cash assistance that Congress provided in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act until 2021. We urge your agencies to ensure that economically vulnerable non-filers receiving Social Security retirement, Social Security disability, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits receive stimulus payments for themselves and their dependent children as quickly as possible – before next year.”   The letter follows the Treasury’s announcement Monday that families on Social Security who do not file tax returns needed to enter additional information on the IRS website within 48 hours to receive the payment and if they missed the deadline, they would not receive the additional payment until 2021.

Coronavirus Latest: Ending All Restrictions On Hospital, Nursing Homes Visits May Not Happen In Short Term, Hogan Says

Fully easing restrictions on nursing home and hospital visits is one of the last steps that would be undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Hogan's plan to reopen the state amid the coronavirus pandemic.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Fully easing restrictions on nursing home and hospital visits is one of the last steps that would be undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Hogan’s plan to reopen the state amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Under the  “Road To Recovery” plan Hogan announced Friday , lessening restrictions on visits is considered “high risk” and would be implemented under the third and final stage of the reopening process. The plan said “there is no realistic timeline yet” for reaching that level of reopening, which also includes things like large religious and social gatherings and high-capacity restaurants and bars.   Nursing homes have been hit hard by COVID-19, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of cases tied to facilities across the state.   One of the hardest-hit nursing homes is the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where  as of Monday  there have been 26 deaths from the virus.

That’s where we have these federal teams that are coming in to assist us, and nursing homes continues to be a place where we’re concerned about the outbreak, but… we’re not watching different numbers in nursing homes because they’re calculated into the increased numbers of cases numbers of hospitalizations, number of ICU (cases) and number of deaths and unfortunately they’re a high percentage of all of those.”   Earlier this month , Hogan announced the creation of “strike teams” made up of members of the Maryland National Guard, local and state health departments, Maryland Institute of Medical Service Systems and state hospital systems to provide extra supplies and care to residents of nursing homes that have seen large numbers of cases of COVID-19.

‘It’s Beyond Frustrating’: Maryland Child Care Providers Still Waiting On State Money For Caring For Essential Workers’ Kids
.W
Some Maryland child center directors and owners said they’re worried they won’t be able to stay open much longer because they haven’t been paid in weeks.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  One thing Maryland’s frontline workers haven’t had to worry about during the COVID-19 pandemic is child care, but that could soon change.  Some Maryland child center directors and owners said they’re worried they won’t be able to stay open much longer because they haven’t been paid in weeks.   “The funds that we have can maybe get us through another two weeks,” Sue Kruhm, the owner of Peter Pan Learning Center, said.   Maryland Schools Superintendent Karen Salmon ordered most child care providers to close last month when state-imposed coronavirus restrictions began.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Some childcare centers were allowed to remain open for essential workers, but at no cost to families.   Instead, the State Board of Education was supposed to be footing the bill and pay $350 each week per-child under the age of three, and $250 for children over the age of three.   The payments, however, have not yet come.   “When you offer something out and we agree to it, we do expect to get what that agreement is,” Iamani-Angela Rose, the director of Joshua’s Place, said.   Providers said they operate on thin margins and are taking care of fewer kids, meaning less revenue, but the bills for them haven’t stopped coming in.   “We’re still having to pay the utilities, we’re still having to pay the mortgage, we’re still having to buy supplies,” said Carrie Youssi with Peter Pan Learning Center.   On top of that, they said there’s been plenty of confusion, and some aren’t sure what to do next.   “It’s beyond frustrating, it’s overwhelming and sometimes it’s quite saddening,” Rose said.   In a statement released Friday by the Maryland Department of Education, it said, in part:   “The processing time can be attributed to the need to put an entirely new administrative and validation process into place, the volume of invoices and limited staffing.   WJZ has learned that payments will be mailed out next week.   The Maryland Department of Education also said Friday it will be sending out $2,000 grant payments to essential child care providers by the end of next week.

FDA Warns Of Serious Side Effects From Drugs Touted By Trump To Treat Coronavirus
.W
The US Food and Drug Administration warned on Friday against the use of two drugs that have been touted by President Donald Trump as potential treatments for the novel coronavirus.

(CNN) —  The US Food and Drug Administration warned on Friday against the use of two drugs that have been touted by President Donald Trump as potential treatments for the novel coronavirus.  The drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, should only be used in hospitals or clinical trials because they can kill or cause serious side effects, the FDA said. These include serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients treated with the drugs, especially when they are combined with the antibiotic azithromycin or other medications that can affect the heart.   Baltimore Officials Warns Residents Not To Drink Or Inject Disinfectant After President Trump’s Comments   “We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions,” the FDA said. “Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.”   Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs, despite lack of evidence   He has mentioned the closely related drugs nearly 50 times since mid-March, according to a CNN analysis of his public comments.   The President has said the drugs would be a “game changer” in the fight against coronavirus, but a growing body of evidence suggests they may not help Covid-19 patients at all, and may do more harm than good.   “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,” the FDA said on Friday. A National Institutes of Health panel has also cautioned against their use.   The FDA said it was monitoring serious side effects in coronavirus patients who took the drugs.   In mid-March, the President said that hydroxychloroquine has “been around for a long time, so we know if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.”   But on Friday, the FDA said that “adverse events included abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death.”   In a statement, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said the agency understands that “health care professionals are looking for every possible treatment option for their patients,” but he emphasized that the drugs come with risks.   “While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19,” he said, “there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered.”   The FDA said those risks “may be mitigated when health care professionals closely screen and supervise these patients such as in a hospital setting or a clinical trial,” which is mentioned in an emergency-use authorization for the drugs issued last month.   Growing body of evidence suggests drugs may not help patients at all   Preliminary results from a large study of hydroxychloroquine suggest that the drug “didn’t really have much of an effect on the recovery rate,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday.   The study, sponsored by the New York state Department of Health, looked at about 600 patients at 22 hospitals in the greater New York City area.   Those who took hydroxychloroquine, with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, were no more likely to survive their infections than those who did not, according to David Holtgrave, dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health, who conducted the study.   Like many studies on coronavirus, the research has not yet been peer-reviewed or formally published, but Holtgrave said “we don’t see a statistically significant difference between patients who took the drugs and those who did not.”   Another early study involving the Department of Veterans Affairs found that coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation than those who did not take the drug.   The research, which looked back at patients’ charts to see how they fared, was not a controlled trial. But it found that patients who took hydroxychloroquine had higher deaths rates compared to those who didn’t.   In a similar French study, researchers examined medical records from 181 coronavirus patients who had pneumonia and required supplemental oxygen. About half had taken hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital, and the other half had not.   The study, which was published on a pre-print server before undergoing peer review, found no statistically significant difference in the death rates of the two groups, or in their chances of being admitted to the intensive care unit.   Eight patients who took the drug, though, developed abnormal heart rhythms and had to stop taking it.   Patients taking the drugs for approved reasons should continue doing so, FDA says   The FDA emphasized on Friday that patients taking the drugs for approved reasons should continue taking their medicine as prescribed.   Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria, the agency said, and hydroxychloroquine is also approved for certain autoimmune conditions such as lupus.   “The benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks at the recommended doses for these conditions,” the agency said.

The Baltimore City Health Department warns residents not to drink or inject disinfectant after comments from President Donald Trump suggested it might help protect people from coronavirus.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Baltimore City Health Department warns residents not to drink or inject disinfectant after comments from President Donald Trump suggested it might help protect people from coronavirus.  Trump remarked at Thursday’s White House briefing that he’s seen that disinfectant “knocks it (COVID-19) out in a minute. And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs — so it’ll be interesting to check that. … It sounds interesting to me.”     But local health officials are warning against it saying it will not protect people from COVID-19 and it could cause serious illness or death.     DO NOT, we repeat, DO NOT drink or inject disinfectant! This will NOT protect you  #COVID19 , & could cause serious illness or death.

In a statement on its website,  RB, the makers of Lysol and Dettol , said due to “recent speculation and social media activity” the company was asked if ingesting disinfectants can be used as a treatment for coronavirus. To which they said, “no.”   “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” RB said in the statement. “As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines.

Coronavirus Latest: Howard County Officials Stress Importance Of Contact Tracing

Health Officer Dr. Maura Rossman said while it can feel intrusive, the information people share is confidential.

COLUMBIA, Md. (WJZ) —  Officials at the state and federal levels have been stressing the importance of contact tracing in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, including Howard County’s health officer.  Health Officer  Dr. Maura Rossman said while it can feel intrusive, the information people share is confidential. When a person gets a call from their local health department, the information gathered is only shared with the department to help combat COVID-19.   “ In actuality, contact tracing is one of these old-fashioned methods that public health (officials) have been using for decades to investigate disease and help persons who have (an) infectious disease, prevent transmission to others, and find out about how they got the disease in the first place,” she said.   With contact tracing, a staff member at a local health department will get a report from the state or a health care provider. The contact tracer will then reach out to anyone who has come into recent contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Gov. Larry Hogan has included more vigorous contact tracing as one of the necessary steps the state needs before it begins to reopen.”   We have quadrupled our capability to do contact tracing by building a robust force of 1000 contact tracers and launching a state-of-the-art contact tracing link called COVID Link,” Hogan said.   Baltimore residents Joan Esparta and Brittani Wynn said they think contact tracing is a good idea to slow the virus.   “It alerts a lot more people,” Esparta said.   “It would be important to see where is the source is coming from or where it’s being spread, ideally to stop it,” Wynn said.

Coronavirus Latest: Marylanders Will Still Have To Wear Face Coverings, Social Distance In Public When ‘Stay At Home’ Order Is Lifted
.W
Dr. Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins said in a press conference Friday that the public will have to continue to wear face coverings in public when stay at home orders are lifted to limit the spread of COVID-19.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan announced Friday that he hopes to lift the stay at home orders sometime in May as long as the numbers or hospitalizations of coronavirus cases begin a downward trend.  Hogan and Johns Hopkins Dr. Tom Inglesby, however, stressed that this will be a “gradual path” to recovery and certain measures will need to be kept in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.   Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Larry Hogan Hopes To Lift ‘Stay At Home’ Order In May   Inglesby added that it will be critical for the public to know that its own individual efforts will still be very important.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Taken together all of our collective actions and decisions will either slow this virus down, or they will speed up the spread,” he said. “So we’re going to need to keep wearing cloth masks in public. We’re going to need to keep our physical space of six feet or more.”   Inglesby said that the coronavirus will be in the State of Maryland and U.S. until there is a vaccine and population gains immunity.   “When reopening does happen, it will be important for people to understand the settings and work that are lower risk versus more high risk,” Inglesby said. “Outdoors will be safer than indoors, less social interactions will be better than more social interactions, and closer contact and high density will be higher risk than low density. Workplaces can take mitigation measures to lower their own risks, and they should be planning on those now.”   Inglesby said that all these measures will make a big difference when added together collectively, and that Gov. Hogan’s plan for recovery is the correct form of action.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Maryland Couple Tying Knot On Zoom Due To Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Love is patient, love is kind and love is pushing through this pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Love is patient, love is kind and love is pushing through this pandemic.  One Maryland couple is using their love for one another — and technology — to zoom forward with their home-style wedding.   In a perfect world, Greg Macur and Rachel Kruzan would be soaking in the sights at the Colosseum or savoring gelato on their honeymoon in Italy.   “Obviously it was a dream vacation for us, to be able to go there and see the beautiful countryside and see everything Italy has to offer,” Macur said. “But a trip, a honeymoon is really trivial.”   It’s trivial compared to the trying times this global pandemic has wrapped around the world, one Kruzan sees firsthand as an internal physician.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Everyone is seeing a lot of grief and loss and suffering which has been quite difficult for so many people,” she said.   Despite bidding “ciao” to afternoons floating down canals in Venice, the couple humbly welcomes their new reality.   “That was part of our decision as well. To host our wedding virtually, cause we wanted to share our love and commitment and contribute to that hope a little bit too,” Kruzan said.   Saturday, for better or worse, in times of sickness and health, they’ll have the living room ceremony of their dreams.   “We really wanted to be able to see our family and our friends and our loved ones,” Macur said. “So luckily with the explosion of Zoom and all the other video conferencing apps, it’s been awesome. So we’re able to bring everyone together.”   Everyone also includes their dog Nellie.   “I prefer to call her the best dog, but you call her the dog of honor right?”   Thanks to a local florist, seamstress, supportive loved ones and technology, their forever after is zooming forward.   “The material things you have you don’t necessarily always need them,” Macur joked.   And while so much has changed due to COVID-19, their love remains constant.   “A wedding doesn’t really define us, our relationship does,” he said.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Larry Hogan Hopes To Lift ‘Stay At Home’ Order In May
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan is hoping to lift the stay at home order sometime in May as long as the state's number of coronavirus-related deaths and hospitalizations begin a downward trend.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan is hoping to lift the stay at home order sometime in May as long as the state’s number of coronavirus-related deaths and hospitalizations begin a downward trend. The governor said he and the state’s experts are looking for that downward trend over a period of 14 days to determine when it’ll be safe to reopen the state.  “I want to stress that each of these recovery stages will need to be instituted in a safe, gradual and effective manner. If we try to rush this and if we don’t do it in a thoughtful and responsible way, it could cause a rebound of the virus, which could deepen the economic crisis for the fiscal problems and slow our economic recovery,” Hogan said.   The keys, or building blocks, to reopening involve expanding testing, more access to personal protective gear, extensive tracing of contacts of those who are positive, and expanding hospital beds, which have already been done across the state.   “As I discussed on Wednesday. We have made considerable progress on all four of the building blocks which needed to be firmly in place before we could consider lifting restrictions,” Hogan said. “First, we have exponentially expanded our testing capability. Second, we are exceeding our goals to increase hospital surge capacity. Third, we are making progress and increasing the supply of PPE. And fourth, we have quadrupled our capability to do contact tracing by building a robust force of 1,000 contact tracers and launching a state of the art contact tracing platform called COVID link.”   “To begin our reopening and recovery, just as soon as we reach the necessary trends in the critical metrics. I’m optimistic that if Marylanders continue. Staying home and continue practicing physical distancing, a little while longer,” Hogan added. “That our numbers could continue to plateau. And I’m hopeful that we could then be able to begin our recovery in early May.”   Stage one would be lifting the stay at home order and it would include reopening of many of our small businesses.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We would be able to restart many of our lower risk community activities and quality of life improvements changes that could occur during our first stage would include the reopening of certain businesses and retail shops, the reopening of golf courses and recreational boating and fishing, tennis, outdoor religious activities, along with outdoor fitness and gym classes, and the resumption of elective outpatient surgeries and procedures in certain counties with lower cases concentration of cases, local governments could also have additional flexibility to open things including local parks and playgrounds, municipal recreation centers and libraries,” he added.   READ THE GOVERNOR’S FULL PLAN   But those businesses would have to follow appropriate safety protocols. Hogan said these decisions would be based on the ability to continue physical distancing and to continue to limit person-to-person contact.   If stage one activities resume successfully without a spike in deaths, a sustained spike in ICU cases and no significant outbreaks through community transmission, the state can move onto stage two.   People will still need to wear masks or face coverings in public and would have to practice social distancing, officials said.

New One-Stop Maryland Unemployment Site Launches, Already Reporting Issues     Stage two would entail “a larger number of businesses would open, nonessential workers who cannot telework could return to work, and other public activities would be able to come back online. Indoor religious gatherings could resume with perhaps a limited capacity and physical distinct distancing measures.”   At this time, we could return to a more normal structure, Hogan said, adding expanding public transit schedules and the opening of restaurants and potentially bars would come with significant safety restrictions.   The third and final stage would be reinstituting higher risk, activities, such as larger social gatherings, events, religious gatherings and activities at entertainment venues, and a further lessening of restrictions at hospitals, and eventually nursing homes.   The ‘Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery’ is divided into three stages:     STAGE ONE  calls for lifting the stay-at-home order, and involves business, community, religious, and quality of life improvements. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:    Reopening of small shops and certain small businesses   Curbside pickup and drop-off for businesses   Elective medical and dental procedures at ambulatory, outpatient, and medical offices   Limited attendance outdoor religious gatherings   Recreational boating, fishing, golf, tennis, hiking, and hunting   Reopening of car washes   Limited outdoor gym and fitness classes   Outdoor work with appropriate distancing measures   Some personal services           STAGE TWO  will likely be a longer stage of the initial recovery, but will also be the stage when a large number of businesses and activities come back online. Any businesses that reopen during this period would need to comply with strict physical distancing and appropriate safety protocols. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:    Raising the cap on social gatherings   Indoor gyms and fitness classes   Childcare centers   Normal transit schedules   Indoor religious gatherings   Reopening of restaurants and bars with restrictions   Elective and outpatient procedures at hospitals           STAGE THREE  will involve instituting higher-risk activities, but there is no realistic timeline yet for achieving this level. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:     Larger social gatherings   Reopening of high-capacity bars and restaurants   Lessened restrictions on visits to nursing homes and hospitals   Reopening of entertainment venues   Larger religious gatherings         Hogan heads the National Governors Association, which also put out its own extensive  “Roadmap to Recovery”  this week.

People Are Having ‘Weird Dreams’ During COVID-19 Pandemic, Health Experts Say
.W
Countless Americans are reporting having "weird dreams" during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CBS NEWS —  Countless Americans are reporting having “weird dreams” during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Experts say that’s not unusual in times of uncertainty, and the ability to remember them might actually have to do with getting more sleep. You may also even be able to positively influence those nighttime journeys.   Sleep experts say they’ve seen an uptick in vivid dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the ability to recall them.   “Some of us, we’re actually getting more sleep, and you have more dreams right before you awaken in the morning,” Dr. Carol Ash, a sleep specialist with RWJBarnabas Health, said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Stay-at-home mom Stephanie Klein says she’s never had more vivid dreams than the ones she’s experienced over the last several weeks.   “They’re not nightmares, but they more than once have left me drenched in sweat and having like a real physiological response,” Klein said. “I’ve been able to write them down pretty accurately.”   In a Harvard survey, more than 2,000 people described 5,000 COVID-19 related dreams in the last month.   Harvard psychologist Dr. Deirdre Barrett is collecting those dreams. Dr. Barrett says she’s seeing clusters of particular themes.   “There are lot of these ‘Oh my God I have it and maybe I’m gonna die’ and then there are a lot of dreams that have metaphors for the virus, every kind of bug attacking the dreamer,” Barrett said.   Dr. Barrett adds most Americans are having general-anxiety dreams, while healthcare workers are experiencing more post-traumatic type nightmares.   Experts say one function of dreams is to help us emotionally process what we experience in our waking hours. And some say there are actually ways to influence what happens when you close your eyes.   “Just as you fall asleep you can image whatever it is you want to dream about very vividly,” Dr. Barrett said. “And that greatly increases the odds you’ll have the dream you’re requesting.”   Sleep experts also suggest simple ways to set yourself up for good shut-eye:     Keep the same wake up and bedtime   Shut off electronics an hour before bed   Get outside   Reduce your sugar and carb intake     Dr. Barrett recommends sharing your dreams as a way to reach out and connect while we’re all apart.

Stressed Pets: How To Stop It Now And When You Go Back To Work

For some pets used to more regular routines and serious alone time, the sudden reality of 24/7 intimacy could be nerve-racking, even catastrophic, especially if there are small children in the home.

(CNN) —  Happy dogs chasing balls on their fourth walk of the day. Purring puffs of fluff who can’t wait to snuggle with pet parents miraculously home all day. These are the images we may have of sheltering with our pets during the age of coronavirus.  For some pets, that may well be true. For others used to more regular routines and serious alone time, the sudden reality of 24/7 intimacy could be nerve-racking, even catastrophic, especially if there are small children in the home.   “It can be overwhelming for pets when kids are home all the time, especially infants and toddlers. which is why they should never be left alone with the pet, not even for 30 seconds,” said Dr. John Howe, the president of the  American Veterinary Medical Association .   “Even the nicest dog in the world can bite. In fact there are 4.5 million dog bites a year in America, and over 800,000 of them need medical attention,” Howe said. “Over half the bites are to children, and it’s usually a serious injury when it happens to a child.   “Dogs and cats really need a safe place where they feel comfortable, where they can go and not be bothered,” he said, “especially if there’s children in the house.”   We transfer our stress, too   To make matters worse, many of us humans   are incredibly stressed right now.   We’re worried about our health and that of our loved ones during the pandemic. We’re working long hours from home or fretting over the loss of a job. We’re going stir crazy from social isolation or tense from being with the same people without a break.   While we may think we’re handling all that well, our pets will recognize our tension and anxiety — and may make it their own.   “You might think you’re internalizing everything, but what we know from studies on both humans and animals is that we are not. There’s physical manifestations that are probably even more obvious to our dogs and cats than ourselves,” said Dr. Dana Varble, the chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community.   “Their emotions can be a reflection of ours because they are so tightly bonded with us,” said veterinarian Dr. Meredith Montgomery, a clinical assistant professor of shelter medicine at the University of Florida.   Montgomery, who specializes in decreasing stress for shelter dogs and cats, has seen it firsthand while isolating with four medically rescued cats and a dog.   Her cats have not reacted well to the constant din and boundless energy of her two-year-old toddler, who’s now home instead of at day care most of the day.   “None of my cats particularly enjoy each other. So what’s been very important for us in keeping a peaceful household is that they all have their own space within the home,” Montgomery said.   She’s done that by using baby gates to provide some respite and encourages “vertical space within the home and giving each cat access to established areas, like boxes, where they can hide.”   How to tell if your pet is stressed   Realize that there aren’t specific signs that will apply to every dog or cat, experts said.   “Just like us, every dog or cat is an individual,” Montgomery said. “So not only are different things going to stress them, but they also might have different and unique thresholds for stress.”   Stressed dogs can startle, jumping at the slightest sound or movement. Some shake and shiver, vocalize excessively or drool. They can use self-calming techniques, such as yawning, lip licking, excessive grooming or spinning.   Oddly, tense and upset dogs can also look depressed, showing a lack of appetite or energy. At times they can get diarrhea or urinate or defecate more often. And, of course, dogs can become uncharacteristically aggressive, snapping or growling.   Cats, on the other hand, are more difficult to read, said experts. You have to look for more subtle signs, such as overgrooming, increased vocalization, lack of appetite, hiding or acting standoffish and, of course, suddenly ignoring their litter box.   “Cats will usually give you some little hint and if you ignore it, that’s when they start to poop on the bed, pee on the couch, go outside the litter box,” Howe said.   While you should always check with your vet to make sure there’s no urinary infection, stress itself can cause significant problems, he said.   “In fact, sometimes cats get a hemorrhagic cystitis where they start peeing blood, and it’s just from stress, not from infection,” Howe said.   Help your dog and cat calm down   It’s all about routine.  For both species, the main solution is to stick to a regular regimen, just as you would do with a young child, experts said.   “They love to have the same routine,” Howe said. “Getting up at the same time, eating at the same time, playing at the same time. That’s the key.”   Use pet gates and crates.  If a dog is crate trained, it can be very soothing for them to go back to their own special place, Howe said.   “They’re safe, they’re comfortable, and it’s an opportunity for them to practice independence in their own space,” he said. The use of baby and pet gates or barriers can also help keep pets and children separated, he added.   “Gates are so good to have while you’re doing something like cooking, when you can’t give the kids or dog direct supervision,” Howe said.   Play species-specific music. It’s actually true that music does soothe the savage soul.   “Something that I use in the shelters and high-volume spay-neuter facilities that I’ve worked in is playing music,” Montgomery said. “I have used slow-paced classical music at a low volume for ‘quiet hour’ with shelter dogs.”   She said that allows them time for decompression with a food puzzle or “treat-filled Kong, providing a healthy, appropriate chewing outlet.”   There are even species-specific tunes. A  study published in 2015  found that cats preferred such feline-favorite sounds such as chirping, purring and the sucking sound of nursing kittens, mixed in with some classical music strains. You and your cat can listen  here , while Spotify and other websites provide  playlists  for dogs.   Keep grooming and playing.  Dogs need regular exercise and playtime with their owners, experts said. If you’re suddenly sitting on your couch all day instead, you’ll soon see the signs of distress in your pet.   Cats, too, need daily play that mimics what they would do in the wild. Playing with toys such as feather spinners and puzzles that contain treats can energize cats and keep them happy.   “Play with them, stimulate their hunting instincts, then feed them,” Howe suggested. After all, big cats in the wild rest after a good hunt and a full tummy.   Hopefully, grooming is part of your regular routine as good health care for your dog or cat. When it comes to calming, if your cat likes to be brushed, that’s often a winner.   “Grooming is very soothing to most cats,” Howe said.   Check your litter box etiquette.  Most cat owners already know they need to keep the litter boxes sparkling clean by scooping often. Cat are also very sensitive to the type of litter (most like sandy or clay-based) and scent (they prefer no scent). The litter box should be big enough for the cat to turn around in — bigger is better — and there should be a litter box on every level of your home. And if you have multiple cats?   “If you have two cats, you have three litter boxes spaced throughout the house, if you have three cats, add another,” Montgomery said.   The rule is to always have one more litter box than the total number of cats in the home. It’s also a good idea not to have a covering on a litter box, especially in multi-cat households, as cats feel most vulnerable while urinating or defecating, experts said.   Use positive, not negative reinforcement.  Having a dog rip up clothing or paper or your cat starting to scratch the couch or either species offering a sudden “gift” of pee or poop may seem like a personal affront, but experts said you should never take it personally.   “Dogs, and potentially cats, may be experiencing severe anxiety, which results in these fear-based or anxiety-based behaviors,” Montgomery said. “But it’s not some form of retribution against the owners. It’s because they’re experiencing a really heightened emotional state.”   Positive reinforcement, such as providing treats when the cat does go in the litter box or the dog poops outside, is the best way to solve behavior problems, experts said.   “Unfortunately one of the harder things to do is to ignore bad behavior,” Varble said. “But say your dog is bugging you, constantly nudging you. If they give up and they go away to their bed, it’s really important at that moment to go over to your dog and say, ‘Oh, good dog sitting on your bed. Do the petting there, reinforce that.”   Keep trying .  If problems continue, veterinarians want you to reach out, as they are quite used to helping owners with such behaviors. Vets may suggest pheromone diffusers   — made for both dogs and cats — that you can put in the home to promote relaxation and calm nerves. Your vet may prescribe   additional anxiety medications, or your vet may suggest a consultation with a behavioral specialist.   “The American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, ACVB, has a  great website  to find a veterinary behavioral expert that can do a consult with you,” Varble said. “And some of those behaviorists are already set up to do via the phone or video.”   Getting your pet ready for your return to work   Again, routine is king. “Try and maintain some sort of typical work schedule as best you can right now,” said Varble. “The more that we stick to typical work schedule and routine, the better our pets are going to adapt when we go back to work.”   That includes feeding, exercising, playing and grooming at about the same times each day, experts said. But if you’ve fallen off schedule while sheltering (and who hasn’t), don’t fret.   “If you know you’re going to go back to work in 10 days or so, start getting yourself and your animal on a more typical schedule,” Montgomery said. “Focus on doing things that you have been doing, like taking them for a short walk, and make sure you’re still fitting in those activities after your return to work.”   Consider crate training:  If you haven’t taught your dog how to stay in a crate, that might be a good choice now, experts said.   “Now while you’re still home, get your dog used to being in the crate,” Howe said. “You can still walk by and talk to your dog, but getting them used to the crate if you can’t leave them loose is very important.”   Keep up the playtime.  Just because you’re not there in the house all day doesn’t mean you can’t have “quality time” with your pet, experts said.   “What may this look like? Ten to 30 minutes of play with a favorite wand toy, special brushing session (if liked by your pet), a walk with your leashed dog, or time spent with a favorite toy playing fetch or tug-of-war,” Montgomery said, adding that her older dog enjoys “getting one-on-one time for ear scratches with her favorite person.”   As for pets with high energy, finding them an appropriate outlet can be important, she said.   “Daytime, individual dog-walking services may be beneficial as people return to nonessential services,” Montgomery said. “Providing food-filled Kongs or feeding toys and puzzles for cats and dogs can also be a way to keep their minds happy and engaged while we are away at work.”   Reach out to your vet.  Veterinarians want pet owners to reach out for help, both during coronavirus and after.   “We have a lot of information for the pet-owning public created by veterinarians on our  website,  and they can also find  COVID-19-specific information  as well,” Howe said.

Coronavirus Creates Unprecedented Maryland Congressional Election
.W
Ballots cast in person in Maryland's special congressional election between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik will be quarantined for about 24 hours after poll close before being counted — to give any potential germs a chance to die to help protect election workers.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) —  Ballots cast in person in Maryland’s special congressional election between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik will be quarantined for about 24 hours after poll close before being counted — to give any potential germs a chance to die to help protect election workers.  It’s one of the safety measures that’s being taken in an unprecedented Maryland election on Tuesday that will only have three places for in-person voting out of concern for the coronavirus, as election officials are strongly urging eligible voters to mail in their ballots in a single race to decide who will serve the rest of the term of the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings,  who died in October .   In hopes of avoiding the lines seen in this month’s Wisconsin primary, roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed to registered voters in the district. More than 77,000 already have been turned in. More than half of the vote could be released on the state elections board website shortly after the 8 p.m. poll close on Tuesday.   Precautions due to the virus in this special election have thrust the candidates into unknown campaign territory in the time of a pandemic.   Fundraising has been tough. Candidates haven’t been able to reach voters with traditional techniques like door-to-door campaigning or large events. Both candidates say they have been trying to reach voters more through social media.   The majority-black district that includes a large portion of Baltimore as well as parts of its suburbs in Baltimore and Howard counties is heavily Democratic, with more than four Democrats for each Republican.   Klacik, the Republican who has appeared on Fox News and caught President Donald Trump’s attention with her social media posts that prompted the president to describe the district as a “ disgusting rat and rodent infested mess ,” said the pandemic has made it difficult to campaign. But the 38-year-old believes she has an edge on the 71-year-old Mfume in the realm of social media.   “I don’t think he was really on social media platforms previously, so I felt like we had a little bit of an advantage that way, but, at the same time, he has such a big name,” Klacik said. “So, we’re basically trying to shout out loud on social media how we can make a positive impact against basically an incumbent, because he had the seat prior to Congressman Cummings.”   Mfume, a former NAACP head who held the U.S. House seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, said he also has been working hard on social media. The man who won his first race for Baltimore City Council in 1978 by three votes said he’s not taking anything for granted in the uncertain times.   “It probably concerns me more, because I recognize how elections can be close — even when you don’t think that they are going to be,” Mfume said.   Some of the leading issues both candidates have been campaigning on include health care, reducing crime and promoting job creation.   Mfume supports stronger gun-control measures and focusing on root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. He has been advocating for greater support for apprenticeships to develop skills for young people to find work.   Klacik has been advocating to help struggling parts of Baltimore through a federal program known as opportunity zones. The program, which is supported by Trump, focuses on increasing private investment in distressed communities with tax incentives for people who invest in real estate projects and operate businesses in designated low-income communities.   Only three in-person voting centers will be open Tuesday for voters who can’t vote by mail, such as the disabled or the homeless, though other eligible voters can cast ballots in person if they choose.   Voting centers are being prepared to comply with social distancing guidelines.   “Things will be very spread apart,” said Nikki Charlson, the state election board’s deputy administrator. “The poll workers will be sanitizing the surfaces.”   The winner will run as an incumbent in the state’s crowded June 2 primary for a full term. Ballots for the primary will be mailed to Maryland voters in early to mid-May, very soon after Tuesday’s election.   “That just seems a little strange and foreign. It’s because it really is,” Mfume said. “We’ve never had anything like this in the state before.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

No Need To Wipe Down Groceries Or Takeout, Experts Say, But Do Wash Your Hands
.W
nan

(CNN) —  Has wiping down your groceries and take-out food become part of your coronavirus survival kit?  It might be time to reconsider, experts say, especially if that extra effort is adding to your daily stress. Even the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is re-emphasizing there’s no real risk of getting the virus that causes Covid-19 that way.   “We want to assure you there is currently NO evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the #COVID19,” the agency tweeted recently.   Jamie Lloyd-Smith is one of the scientists who worked on the  only study to analyze  how long SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, might remain on various surfaces.   Despite the fact his research found the virus might live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and metal and plastic for two to three days, Lloyd-Smith doesn’t bother to wipe down his own groceries or takeout.   “I don’t, personally,” Lloyd-Wright said. “I treat my hands as potentially contaminated while I’m handling the groceries and unpacking them and I make sure that I wash them fully when I’m done with that process.”   Virologist Dr. John Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades, is also not overly concerned.   “Personally, we’re alternating cooking food at home and getting takeout food for a houseful of kids home from college right now,” Williams said. “And we’re not wiping down the containers from the restaurant.”   Because the odds of someone coming along and depositing enough virus on a grocery item or takeout container are pretty low, “I view it as sort of a hypothetical risk,” Lloyd-Smith said.   “So yes, I’m careful, I’ll wash my hands, but I don’t sort of regard it as glowing radioactively with virus.”   His advice might change, said Lloyd-Smith, if the person was at high risk from the virus, such as elderly or immunocompromised.   “One reasonable and easy-to-implement precaution for groceries that don’t need refrigeration is simply to let them sit for a day or more before unpacking them,” he said. “This will vastly reduce the level of any contamination that is present.”   How did we get so concerned about groceries?   The concern over virus transmission via surfaces began in late March after the study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.   “What the study showed is that under certain conditions in the laboratory, which are obviously kind of artificial, SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,” Lloyd-Smith said.   The experiment did not account for other factors that could help to inactivate the virus, such as sunlight or disinfectants or look at varying levels of virus, Lloyd-Smith said, so there’s no “magic” in the numbers they found.   Food safety expert Benjamin Chapman agreed. “There’s no magic number in this because temperature matters, humidity matters, how much virus was put there in the first place matters,” said Chapman, a professor in the department of agricultural and human sciences at North Carolina State University.   The amount of SARS-CoV-2 also diminished rather quickly over time, compared to say, a norovirus or “cruise-ship” intestinal virus, said Williams, who is chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.   In the study the virus was down “a hundred fold on cardboard in eight hours,” Williams said. “That means 99% of the virus was gone by eight hours, and the same is true on stainless steel and plastic.”   “The cruise ship norovirus, however, can persist for many days in an environment on inanimate objects,” Williams added. “So you could be on a cruise and have norovirus and then your cruise finishes and I get on the next cruise in your cabin and I can get your norovirus.”   Washing hands is key   If you want to focus on something that makes a key difference every time, experts say, it’s much more important to become a fanatic about properly washing or sanitizing your hands after any potential encounter with coronavirus.   Instead of worrying about how long the virus will persist and spraying everything down or wiping it down with sanitizer, you can manage this “very unlikely route with low risk and make it even lower by just practicing proper good hand washing,” said Chapman, “or using hand sanitizer once you’ve returned home from the grocery store or gotten takeout food.   “I don’t want to discount this conversation or people’s fears, but it’s almost like it doesn’t matter much as long as everyone is washing their hands,” Chapman added.   If you are still really nervous about your risk of contamination by food products, then by all means use disinfectant wipes on the outside of containers, Williams said.   “Some people want to wear a belt and suspenders to hold their pants up, right?” Williams said.   “So if people are concerned about virus transmission from groceries or take out food, just carefully remove the inside containers of food from the outer bag, throw away the outer bag and then use a little hand gel or soap and water.   “But still, the odds of getting the virus that way are very, very low,” Williams added.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Says Some Of President Trump’s Messaging Has ‘Not Been Great’
.W
During an appearance on CBS' Face The Nation Sunday, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump's recent messaging during White House Coronavirus Taskforce briefings has "not been great."

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  During an appearance on CBS’ Face The Nation Sunday, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump’s recent messaging during White House Coronavirus Taskforce briefings has “not been great.”  This comes after President Trump’s remarks at Thursday’s White House briefing that he’s seen that disinfectant “knocks it [COVID-19] out in a minute. And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs — so it’ll be interesting to check that… It sounds interesting to me.”     Gov. Hogan said he has raised concerns multiple times about conflicting messaging during these briefings.   “I think it’s always critically important for a leader to put out the facts and to be as open and honest and transparent as possible,” Gov. Hogan said. “That’s what I’ve tried to do as the governor of my state, particularly in the middle of this crisis. I think that it’s critical that the President of the United States, when people are really scared and in the middle of this worldwide pandemic, that in these press conferences, we really get the facts out there. Unfortunately, some of the messaging has not been great.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Gov.

Hogan said. “People were thinking about: Is this something you could do to protect yourself?”   He added that having briefings to inform people about what is happening in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic is important.   “I think having briefings to inform the public of what’s going on is important,” Gov. Hogan said. “And I think [President Trump’s] coronavirus team has really been doing a good job, and there’s some really smart folks on there that are providing valuable information.

Coronavirus Latest: Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital To Open Monday
.W
The University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine announced Sunday the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital will open Monday.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine announced Sunday the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital will open Monday.  The BCCFH is a 250-bed field medical station set up as a state-licensed hospital operated jointly by Johns Hopkins Medicine and the University of Maryland Medical Center.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The BCCFH will initially take a limited number of recovering COVID-positive patients from select area hospitals. It will then expand the capacity for additional patients from other hospitals.   It will treat patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and need direct medical attention, but who are recovering from their infection.   “Opening this field hospital is a major victory in the fight against COVID-19 and one of our administration’s top priorities since day one of this crisis. I want to thank all the frontline health care workers and our partners at the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine for making this pivotal health care facility a reality for Baltimore City and area hospitals. We are in this together and will get through this together.” Gov. Larry  Hogan said in a statement.   Patients from predominantly Baltimore City hospitals will be transported to the field hospital through either emergency department or inter-facility referrals.   All patients who will be admitted to the BCCFH are anticipated to be received as a transfer from Baltimore City hospitals and not as direct admissions.   The field hospital is not a community testing clinic and cannot be accessed by general referrals from primary care physicians.

Prince George’s County Asks Judge To Toss Suit Over Coronavirus In Jail
.W
The class-action suit filed Tuesday by Civil Rights Corps claims Prince George's County Jail prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are isolated in cells with walls covered in feces, mucus and blood.

GREENBELT, Md. (AP/WJZ) —  One of Maryland’s largest counties on Sunday asked a federal judge to throw out a civil rights group’s lawsuit that claims its jail has failed to stop an “uncontrolled” coronavirus outbreak or properly care for infected prisoners.  The class-action suit filed Tuesday by Civil Rights Corps claims Prince George’s County Jail prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are isolated in cells with walls covered in feces, mucus and blood.   “They are barely monitored and receive no real treatment,” the suit says.   The Washington, D.C.-based group’s suit asks the court to order the immediate release of medically vulnerable prisoners. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Greenbelt, Maryland, instructed the county to file a written response to the suit’s claims before she rules.   In a court filing Sunday, attorneys for the county said jail officials acted proactively to protect inmates and staff from the virus.   READ MORE: Maryland Releases 2,000 Inmates To Slow Spread Of COVID-19 Behind Bars   Mary Lou McDonough, director of the county’s corrections department, “led the way” among correctional facilities in Maryland to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, county officials wrote.   The county says the jail’s average daily population has dropped from 720 to 560 inmates since March 1, with 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the jail population.   None of the infected inmates have been hospitalized, and 10 of them have fully recovered and returned to the jail’s general population, the county says.   McDonough is the only defendant named in the suit.   Civil Rights Corps has filed similar suits over conditions at jails in Miami, Dallas, Chicago and Detroit.   For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.   For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and even death.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

University Of Maryland Professor Offers Tips To Improve Your Mental Health During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
The past few weeks have brought a range of emotions and feelings due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  It’s been nearly a month since Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order went into effect, mandating Marylanders stay at home, unless for essential activities.  The past few weeks have brought a range of emotions and feelings as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.   “COVID-19 is really marked by uncertainty,” Dr. Andrea Chronis-Tuscano, a Professor of Psychology from the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences at University of Maryland, said.   Combine the uncertainty with loneliness, and in some cases too much togetherness, your mental health can be affected.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     That’s why Dr. Chronis-Tuscano said it’s important to focus on the things we can control.   “For me, I know getting up, taking a shower, trying to maintain some semblance of a routine really helps,” Dr. Chronis-Tuscano explained. “I know that it helps children as well.”   She also recommends getting outside and not being too hard on yourself.   Dr. Chronis-Tuscano also said it’s ok to give yourself a break if you’re not operating at your best.   “For those of us trying to work from home, and homeschool kids, I think we need to be really kind to ourselves and set realistic expectations,” she said.   If things start to feel like too much to handle, you should contact your doctor and look into TeleHealth.   “[You’re] able to do so much right now in terms of TeleHealth, and this is certainly a time when the use of TeleHealth is very wide spread,” Dr. Chronis-Tuscano said.

How To Clean Your Bathroom To Protect Against Coronavirus
.W
The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is known to live on hard surfaces for up to three days, according to data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Your bathroom has plenty of those.

(CNN) —  With nearly all American kids out of school and large numbers of workers telecommuting, many houses are more crowded than usual.   And bathrooms are perhaps the one crucial point in the house where all humans — and therefore microbes — pass through. So during the present pandemic, keeping your toilets, sinks, counters and showers as germ-free as possible is key to keeping you and your family healthy.   The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is known to live on hard surfaces for up to three days, according to data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Your bathroom has plenty of those.   “We’d be mostly concerned with the inanimate surfaces,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.   “Any household disinfectants will work against this virus,” he said. “And soap and water work perfectly well.”   We’ve got a guide to help you think about the area of your house that could become ground zero of the fight against coronavirus.   Make sure you follow the right steps   As you get ready to clean your bathroom, start by making sure to wash your hands.   If you’re using disinfectants, you should pick higher-quality ones. The US Environmental Protection Agency released a five-page list of disinfectants — including Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and certain Lysol sprays — which are strong enough to defeat “harder to kill” viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.   It’s important to focus on cleaning “high-touch” areas of your bathroom including light switches, doorknobs and the sink areas in particular. That can also include less obvious areas everyone in the house likely touches, including showerheads, shower curtains and around the toilet seat.   Anything that people touch should be cleaned, whether they have symptoms or not. That includes hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, shavers or other appliances in the bathroom. (You may not have touched razors recently if you’re trying to grow out a gnarly quarantine beard.)   We know you would  never  forget this, but just a friendly reminder not to forget to make sure devices are assuredly  unplugged  and  turned off  before you embark on a deep clean.   You should consider placing a wipeable cover on electronic devices if you can, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises, and try to use a solution that’s at least 70% alcohol.   It pays to be thorough, because droplets capable of carrying the virus can really get around within your bathroom.   For instance, one study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology showed that particles and droplets can be spread up to 6 feet when you flush with the seat up.   Follow the cleaning product maker’s directions   “You don’t have to panic clean,” said Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the American Cleaning Institute. But he emphasized that you need to make sure you’re cleaning correctly.   After you wipe down hard surfaces like sinks and counter tops, make sure to leave them wet for 3 to 5 minutes. Who knew? Turns out, the professionals do. The American Cleaning Institute recommends letting the surfaces air-dry, and then rinse them with water.   People aren’t aware of the need to wait, said Sansoni, who noted that’s important to give the cleaning products time to actually work and thoroughly kill germs or viruses.   Think there’s no way you’re doing it wrong? Sansoni cited findings from an Ipsos poll his organization commissioned, which found that 42% of Americans weren’t cleaning or disinfecting the right way — and could be leaving themselves vulnerable.   Many people aren’t following directions printed on product labels, including allowing cleaning products enough time to work, he said. Please make sure you’re abiding by the instructions on your products, and that you’re using them as the manufacturer intended.   Use separate bathrooms if a family member is sick   If a family member or roommate living with you is showing Covid-19 symptoms, it’s important to assign them their own specific bathroom and to separate that person from others.   If you don’t have more than one bathroom, have the person with symptoms clean surfaces they’ve touched after they use the bathroom, according to the CDC.   If they’re too sick to clean, your second option is to have a healthy person clean the area. Wait as long as you can before entering, wear a mask and gloves to clean and wash the mask and your clothes after cleaning. (Toss the gloves.)   That might not be an option if your patient needs help using the bathroom.   “You may have to help the person use the facilities,” Schaffner said. “You can assign one person in the family to help them and to establish their routine.”   If you’re in close quarters with someone showing Covid-19 symptoms, you absolutely must protect yourself with a mask at minimum, he emphasized.   Protect yourself if you’re helping a sick family member   In addition to a mask, Schaffner recommended wearing gloves and some sort of other garment over your regular clothes if you’re caring for an ill person in the bathroom. “Watch the person, see what they touch, and wipe that off,” he said.   That could include the toilet seat, which may receive a lot of action since diarrhea and vomiting are common Covid-19 symptoms.   As an additional precaution, Schaffner also recommended placing any sanitizing wipes you use in a plastic bag and throwing that in the garbage. Then change your clothes after you’re done cleaning the bathroom or helping someone else use it.   If someone in your home is sick, it’s especially important to wash any of their towels or dirty clothes separately.   For towels, bath mats, cloth shower curtains and other soft materials, the CDC recommends laundering them according to the manufacturer’s directions with the “warmest appropriate water setting.” Then dry those items completely.   Soap can work even better than disinfecting products   “By now you know that viruses, including the coronavirus, can live on surfaces for awhile — several hours, even several days — which means we have to be cleaning all the time,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in a video.   That gets complicated when you’re burning through disinfectants and sanitizing wipes, and store shelves with those products are all to often bare.   But you may already have soap at home, and it could be easier to find in a supermarket. And the good news? “Many scientists argue it’s actually a better alternative,” Gupta said.   There’s scientific backing for this thinking: At a microscopic level, the novel coronavirus is surrounded by a “lipid envelope.” Soap works on the virus by tearing through that layer of lipids that surrounds the proteins inside and breaking apart the virus.   The process is similar to how dish soap eats away at grease on a pan in ways that plain water can’t.   Finish the job correctly   Finishing the cleaning job right is crucial.   Gupta explained that you don’t necessarily have to wear gloves as you clean.   But if you do, make sure when you’re done to remove them by sliding your finger in underneath their opening so you don’t touch the exposed outer side with your bare hands.   And then wash your hands one last time after you’ve thrown away your gloves.   The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

Coronavirus Latest: Gov. Hogan Announces More COVID-19 Testing Sites At VEIP Stations

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, more testing sites are opening up across the state, including two new ones at vehicle emission inspection program stations.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  As the coronavirus pandemic continues, more testing sites are opening up across the state, including two new ones at vehicle emission inspection program stations.  The two new testing sites will be at the VEIP stations in Owings Mills and Prince Frederick, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday.   There are now seven total VEIP testing sites open statewide. They are in Bel Air, Columbia, Glen Burnie, Owings Mills, Prince Frederick, Waldorf and White Oak.   “The acquisition of test kits from South Korea is already helping to expand our testing capacity across the state,” said Governor Hogan. “Continuing to expand our testing capabilities even further in high-priority areas, including these drive-thru sites, is an essential part of our recovery plan.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ   LIST: Maryland Coronavirus Testing Sites: Drive-Thrus, Triage Tents & More     Tests will be offered on an appointment-only basis to Maryland residents who are symptomatic and at high risk for complications from COVID-19, the Hogan administration said in a press release.   Anyone who wants to be tested must have a health care provider and an appointment.   They must first call a physician, who will assist patients in ordering and scheduling a test online using CRISP, the state’s health information exchange, with an exception of the site in Bel Air- which requires physicians to schedule appointments through a telephone hotline.   Patients cannot schedule or order tests by themselves.   At each test site, patients must remain in their vehicles with the windows rolled up until it’s time to receive their test. The testing requires a clinician to insert a swab into the back of the person’s nostril for several seconds.   Tested individuals will get information with further instructions at the test site and should continue to self-isolate at home while waiting for results, which should come within approximately two to five days, Hogan’s administration said.

A Maryland university is helping Facebook collect data for a real-time map that shows the prevalence of self-reported coronavirus symptoms around the country.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (WJZ) —  A Maryland university is helping Facebook collect data for a real-time map that shows the prevalence of self-reported coronavirus symptoms around the country.  Facebook released its first round of data one week ago. It was based on surveys they invited their users to participate in. Shown in county-by-county maps, the data is meant to help officials allocate resources, better understand how the disease is spread and which communities can eventually reopen.   The U.S. map was developed by Carnegie Mellon who worked with Facebook to launch the survey in early April.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Now, the survey is launching worldwide and researchers, including the University of Maryland’s Frauke Kroiter, is helping to develop it.   “The goal is to create the questions so that everyone understands and can report,” Kroiter told WJZ.   It’s her job to help the survey get to every country in the right languages and in the right regions.   But without Facebook, she said, it just wouldn’t have the same reach.   Working with Facebook is a fantastic opportunity,” Kroiter added.   The survey invites Facebook users to share if they have symptoms like fevers, coughing or shortness of breath and loss of smell; all symptoms of COVID-19.   “These self-reports, how people feel, can be very important to know what’s going to happen,” Kroiter said.   In a post on April 20, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Founder of Facebook, wrote:   Facebook is uniquely suited to run these surveys because we serve a global community of billions of people and can do statistically accurate sampling. We do this in a privacy protective way where only the researchers at Carnegie Mellon see individual survey responses.   The survey and the data that comes from it can provide an early indicator of where the outbreak is growing and where the curve is flattening.

‘We Need Them’: UMSON Gives Students Early-Exit Option To Join Nursing Workforce During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
The University of Maryland School of Nursing has approved an early-exit option for students who want to start working as nurses to bolster the essential workforce during the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The University of Maryland School of Nursing has approved an early-exit option for students who want to start working as nurses to bolster the essential workforce during the coronavirus pandemic.  The option is available to select students in the entry-into-practice Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Clinical Nurse Leader master’s option who are scheduled to graduate on May 14 from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.   Gov. Larry Hogan’s public health surge plan is calling for adding up to 6,000 hospital beds across the state and included  reopening Laurel Hospital  and a field hospital an alternate care site  at the Baltimore Convention Center.   UMSON has 98 BSN and 53 CNL students qualified to request for an early exit.   “We are very pleased to partner with key Maryland health care systems to support them in meeting their needs for nursing personnel during this incredibly critical time,” said Dean Jane Kirschling, PhD, RN, FAAN. “The UMSON students opting into our early-exit option are well prepared and fully equipped to make a major contribution through their service as nursing graduates. I salute those students eligible and willing to serve under this unique initiative. And, I applaud all of our students for their dedication and resiliency during this tumultuous time, whether they are persevering in continuing their educational studies under difficult circumstances or are preparing to graduate and serve our larger community.”   To be eligible, students must meet a specific GPA and academic program requirements.   UMSON will give students a letter to give to prospective employers saying they have met all program requirements and have qualified for and taken the early-exit option.     One of those nurses is Debbie Sahlin- she wanted to become a nurse because of her own sons fight after a TBI at a young age. She hopes she can bring care and compassion to families affected by  #COVID19   @wjz   pic.twitter.com/O2pKsq4rdo   — Rachael Cardin (@RachaelCardin)  April 27, 2020     One of the students taking part is Debbie Sahlin. While she officially graduates in mid-May, on Monday she was hard at work at a newly-opened field hospital caring for patients recovering from COVID-19.   “For all of us, this is just not something we ever expected doing,” she said.   Despite that, Sahlin said she’s ready to begin helping others.   “I’m trained — I have to do it,” she said, “and second, I didn’t go to school to help healthy people, right? Don’t you go to school to become a health care professional because people you serve are sick?”   In total, 107 graduate nurses are taking part in the early workforce entry program.   Amid the global pandemic, their help is greatly needed, Dr. Maeve Howett, the associate dean for the nursing school, said.   “We need them. There is a shortage of nurses nationally and hopefully this just empowers them to feel as though the work they’re doing is terribly important,” Howett said.   Virtual training won’t compare to the hands-on experiences the soon-to-be graduates will get.   Sahlin knows more than most about hospital stays and fighting through hardship; her son suffered a traumatic brain injury as an infant and has been in a wheelchair ever since.

‘Not Your Conventional Hospital’: Field Hospital For COVID-19 Patients At Baltimore Convention Center Opens Monday
.W
The 250-bed field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center opened Monday.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The 250-bed field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center opened Monday.  The field hospital, which will be used to treat recovering coronavirus patients who no longer need to be hospitalized, was set up by the Maryland National Guard and has been ready for weeks but is opening as the state health officials are preparing for a surge of hospitalizations.   Some of the patients had been on ventilators and in intensive care before beginning to recover.   “We have created… a very robust facility. There are individual bays for people, but they’re not rooms. It’s not your conventional hospital,” said Dr. Jim Ficke of Johns Hopkins Medicine.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Johns Hopkins and UMMS jointly operate the field hospital.   “The field hospital is designed to take the pressure off of other medical centers so they can be prepared to take care of the most critically ill patients in our community,” said Dr. Chuck Callahan of UMMS.   As of Sunday, Maryland currently had more than 18,500 cases of COVID-19 in the state and more than 827 have died from the virus.   Although Gov. Larry Hogan recently said he hoped to reopen Maryland by early May, he said the number of hospitalizations and deaths must begin to trend down before he can do that.

Northam Open To Idea Of Reopening Business On Regional Basis
.W
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday he is open to the idea of opening businesses in southwest Virginia before the rest of the state as he weighs when coronavirus restrictions can be lifted.

FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) —  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday he is open to the idea of opening businesses in southwest Virginia before the rest of the state as he weighs when coronavirus restrictions can be lifted.  Northam said at a press conference that the situation in the border city of Bristol illustrates why a regional approach might be necessary.   Bristol, a city that sits on both sides of the Virginia-Tennessee border, now faces a situation where restaurants on the Tennessee side of the border can provide dine-in services to patrons, while those on the Virginia side cannot.   Last week, Northam had downplayed the idea of opening businesses on a regional basis. On Monday, he said wanted to discuss the idea further with the business community.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “To try to be consistent, is it really fair for Tennessee’s businesses to be open and Virginia’s not to be?” Northam asked. “I’m open-minded to all of that. I would say, ‘Stay tuned.’”   Northam faced increasingly skeptical questions at Monday’s press conference about his justification for continuing his executive orders closing nonessential businesses and requiring Virginians to stay at home, particularly as other Southern states are beginning to ease restrictions.   Northam said he’s trying to be guided by the science, but he acknowledged Monday that the science is in a state of flux. One computer model, for instance, suggests that Virginia may have reached its peak of COVID-19 cases. Another model, prepared by the University of Virginia, suggests that keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place through the duration of Northam’s current order of June 10 will only delay an inevitable surge of cases, and result in a sharp peak of cases in August.   “It’s not a perfect science and I would be the first as a scientist to agree with that,” said Northam, a physician. “They call this a novel COVID-19, novel meaning new to the world. So there a lot of things that we don’t know about the virus that we’d like to know.”   Also Monday, Northam said he worked with the governors in Maryland and Delaware to request federal help to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19 cases connected to poultry plants on the Delmarva peninsula. He said workers from the federal Centers for Disease Control arrived in Virginia on Monday. Teams include epidemiologists, contact trace workers and translators who speak Haitian Creole, a language commonly used among the region’s poultry workers.   “The poultry economy on the Delmarva peninsula is so interconnected that a coordinated approach is critical,” Northam said.   For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. The vast majority of people recover.

Coronavirus In Baltimore: City Council Unanimously Extends State Of Emergency

The Baltimore City Council on Monday unanimously extended the city's state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Baltimore City Council on Monday unanimously extended the city’s state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The state of emergency is now extended indefinitely. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young first issued the state of emergency on March 18; state law requires the governing body to approve extending it past 30 days.     #BREAKING : Baltimore City Council unanimously extends City’s State of Emergency.  @wjz   — Rachel Menitoff (@RachelMenitoff)  April 27, 2020     Young announced the extension last week and the council reinforced his decision Monday, saying it was the best way to protect Baltimoreans.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “The city council understands the importance of this at this moment,” council president Brandon Scott said, “and we will continue to be guided by the public health professionals and that’s how we will go out making our decisions.”   Last week, Young said extending the declaration “allows for us to cut through red tape and closely align our resources with our needs.”   The city council also adopted a bill prohibiting landlords from raising rent during and after declared emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.   “When you don’t know where your next check is coming from, you shouldn’t have to worry about whether or not your landlord is raising your rent,” Scott said.   Council members also approved emergency legislation providing $3 million for distance learning for city students and additional funding for the city’s plan to reduce food insecurity.   As part of a public-private partnership, the city established a $5.5 million fund specifically for small businesses.   City councilman Leon Pinkett said he wants to make sure that local and minority-owned businesses specifically are supported during the pandemic.   “We know that oftentimes with emergency spending, local and minority businesses are left out. We just want to make certain that all of our businesses are included,” he said.   As of Monday, there are 1,933 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city.   The council also named Friday “Charm City Cheer Day.” They’re encouraging people to safely cheer on frontline workers at 7 p.m. from the comfort of their homes.

Coronavirus Resources: Maryland SPCA Creates Pet Food Pantry

The Maryland SPCA launched a new program called "Kibble Connection Food Pantry" catered to those who have lost their jobs and are struggling to feed themselves or their families.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Maryland SPCA has launched a new program to help pet parents feed their fur babies during times of need like the coronavirus pandemic.  Animal rescues across the country have seen a spike in adoptions and foster applications since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Maryland SPCA.   “All of our pets right now are currently in foster care with amazing parents so they are all taken care of,” said Katie Flory, the community relations director for the Maryland SPCA.   While many turn to their furry friends during the pandemic for comfort, for some, it has become increasingly difficult in the wake of social distancing restrictions to continue caring for their pets.   “It puts people in a very scary situation where they feel like they’re not going to be able to feed their cats and dogs,” Maryland SPCA volunteer Melissa Welsh said.   As a response, the Maryland SPCA launched a new program called “Kibble Connection Food Pantry” catered to those who have lost their jobs and are struggling to feed themselves or their families.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “If we can provide cat food, dog food to the community as a whole, we’re really hoping to keep animals in their homes but also make sure that people are able to get the social-emotional well-being that we know pets provide,” Flory said.   Through the pet food pantry program, people can fill out a form on the Maryland SPCA website and schedule a time to pick up cat or dog food.   Organizers said it’s crucial to ensure animals get the nutrition they need so they can continue to provide their unconditional love in their forever homes.   “Pets are part of our family and we as a shelter, our mission is to improve the lives of pets and people,” said Flory.

Eighty-two residents and 39 staff members tested positive.   Earlier in April , Hogan announced the creation of “strike teams” made up of members of the Maryland National Guard, local and state health departments, Maryland Institute of Medical Service Systems and state hospital systems to provide extra supplies and care to residents of nursing homes that have seen large numbers of cases of COVID-19.   The governor said Friday that fully easing restrictions on nursing home and hospital visits would be one of the last steps in his “Road to Recovery” plan.

‘Shop This Way’: Walmart Begins Enforcing One-Way Aisles Mandate To Increase Social Distancing
.W
Walmart has started implementing one-way aisles to encourage customers to practice social distancing while shopping inside their stores during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BENTONVILLE, Ark. (CBS Local)  — Walmart has started implementing one-way aisles to encourage customers to practice social distancing while shopping inside their stores during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The one-way aisles mandate was enforced beginning on Thursday, April 23, Walmart said in a  statement  posted on Facebook.   “One-way aisles are designed to increase social distancing and give customers more space on each aisle,” the company wrote.   Customers will see floor decals throughout the store that will help indicate the traffic flow.     Green “Shop This Way” stickers will be on the floor to indicate the entrance of each aisle. Red “Do Not Shop This Way” will tell opposing traffic not to enter the aisle.   Walmart had already  started limiting  the number of customers who can be in the store at once. Stores are now allowing no more than five customers for each 1,000 square feet at a given time, roughly 20 percent of a store’s capacity.   Walmart is the largest private employer in the U.S., with a workforce of approximately  1.5 million  associates at more than 5,000 stores and clubs nationwide.

Recently Recovered From COVID-19? You Could Help Save A Life.

Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may be eligible to donate plasma to LifeBridge Health.

If you have recovered from the coronavirus (COVID-19), you may be eligible to donate plasma to LifeBridge Health for research and possible treatment of others who are ill.  “If a patient suffers from the disease and then they recover, part of the reason they recover is that they developed antibodies and fought off the disease. And so, there’s a theory that we can actually take the antibodies that person has developed and transfuse them into a patient who is acutely ill, and that may help the acutely ill patient recover more quickly,” says Matthew Poffenroth, M.D., chief clinical officer at LifeBridge Health, Physician Enterprise.   Blood donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 is used to make antibody-rich convalescent plasma. Prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from China suggest that convalescent plasma can potentially lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.   LifeBridge Health is partnering with the Blood Bank of Delmarva and the American Red Cross to coordinate plasma donations in accordance with FDA-approved protocols. To donate, you must be symptom-free for 14 days and show a negative result from a second COVID-19 test or be symptom-free for 28 days (in which case you would not need to take a second COVID-19 test).   Those who are eligible can donate through the Blood Bank of Delmarva’s or American Red Cross’ convalescent plasma programs. The donation process takes approximately 1.5 hours to complete and is simple. Donors are often able to relax and watch a movie during the process.   While there is still a lot to be learned about convalescent plasma, there is hope that this therapy can potentially save lives.   If you are interested in donating plasma, visit  lifebridgehealth.org/plasma  to learn more.   Visit lifebridgehealth.org or call 410-601-WELL to learn more about our services at LifeBridge Health and scheduling an appointment.

Coronavirus Study: Maryland Among Top 20 States Where Self-Isolating Is Most Difficult
.W
A study by Wallet Hub rates Maryland as the 18th most difficult state to self isolate in.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The coronavirus pandemic has introduced social distancing measures across the United States in order to slow the spread of the disease. For some states, those measures are relatively easy to abide by. In others, like Maryland, self-isolating can be a bit more difficult. A study conducted by the financial site  WalletHub  places Maryland squarely among the Top 20 states (18th overall) in which social distancing is more of a struggle.  The site’s methodology included three different scores for each state that were dependent upon thirteen other variables to determine which states were the most and least difficult to self isolate in. The three categories are Social Environment, Time Spent on Social Activities and Money Spent on Social Activities and they were based on “ranges from whether residents have supportive relationships to how non-essential travel has changed due to the pandemic and how much consumers spent on social activities before COVID-19.”     Social distancing is an important but stressful way to stop the spread of  #coronavirus . Does your state make social distancing easier or harder?

The state was just behind Washington D.C. which ranked 16th overall, but was well ahead of several other Mid-Atlantic states like Delaware (26th), Pennsylvania (33rd), New Jersey (39th) and New York (41st).

Lidl To Open Baltimore County Grocery Store Location In Timonium

Lidl is set to open up its third location in Baltimore County by mid-2021, the supermarket chain announced Tuesday.

TIMONIUM, MD. (WJZ) —  Lidl is set to open up its third location in Baltimore County by mid-2021, the supermarket chain announced Tuesday.  The location will be in Padonia Village Shopping Center in Timonium. The grocery store has signed a lease for around 31,000 square feet of space to fill the former Green Valley Marketplace that left the center earlier this year.   Padonia Village   Lidl has over 11,000 stores across 32 countries, with 95 stores across nine east coast U.S. states.   “Since entering the United States market, Lidl has built an extremely strong and recognized brand focused on private-label goods with value pricing, and we are extremely confident that this significant differentiation point will resonate throughout the Baltimore County landscape,” stated David Donato, Senior Vice President of Continental Realty Corporation.   “Considering the competitiveness of the grocery category along the York Road corridor, we believe Lidl represents the ideal solution as the new Padonia Village supermarket anchor and will attract new consumers from an expanded radius. The company has demonstrated its commitment to the Timonium community and Padonia Village Shopping Center with its recent investment in the center and we are thrilled to welcome Lidl to our wide-ranging tenant mix.”   The grocery store chain said it has recently opened a 754,000 square foot distribution and logistics warehouse in nearby Cecil County. Due to the demand from COVID-19, the warehouse accelerated from a mid-summer opening.

Coronavirus Latest: Rare Child Syndrome Kawasaki Disease Might Have Link To Covid-19
.W
On Sunday the Paediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) warned about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children, some who had tested positive for Covid-19, presenting "overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters."

(CNN) —  UK pediatrics specialists have warned that a small but rising number of children are becoming ill with a rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus.  On Sunday the Pediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) warned about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children, some who had tested positive for Covid-19, presenting “overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters.”   In a statement sent over the weekend to medical professionals who look after critically ill children, PICS said “abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation.”   So what is Kawasaki disease and how worried should parents and carers be?   What is Kawasaki disease?   Kawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed.   According to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), the condition — also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome — mainly affects children under the age of 5, although it can affect children of any age.   Symptoms include a high temperature lasting for five days or longer, alongside a rash, swollen glands in the neck, dry cracked lips, red fingers or toes and red eyes, according to the healthcare provider.   If treated, the symptoms usually become less severe, the NHS said, adding that the disease is not contagious.   “Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,” Professor Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.   A condition that can lead to heart complications   Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, and serious complications can include aneurysms and coronary artery dilations, according to US healthcare company the Mayo Clinic.   Standard treatment, which involves intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, can substantially decrease the development of coronary artery abnormalities, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.   According to the NHS, around 25% of children with the disease who do not receive treatment go on to experience heart complications, which can include conditions such as heart attacks and heart disease.   However, the health care provider says that most children with Kawasaki disease make a full recovery if they receive prompt treatment.   What causes Kawasaki disease?   Experts admit that the causes of Kawasaki disease are not fully understood, but think that children who develop it could be genetically predisposed to it, having inherited certain genes from their parents.   The disease itself is not contagious, according to the NHS, meaning that it is unlikely to be caused by a virus alone.   The disease is more common in children from Northeast Asia, especially Japan and Korea, the NHS said.   What is the link to Covid-19?   The link between Kawasaki disease and Covid-19 is unclear, but health care professionals have reassured parents that the risk of children becoming severely ill with the virus remains low.   In a report released in April, the CDC said that children diagnosed with coronavirus in the US typically have  mild cases of the virus.   The number of Covid-19 cases among children remains small and while some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date, according to the CDC.   Professor Rosalind Smyth, director and professor of child health, UCL Great Ormond St Institute of Child Health, said current evidence suggests that most children with Covid-19 who receive medical attention have mild symptoms, with about half having a fever, around 40% having a cough and less than 10% of reported cases having gastrointestinal symptoms.   “However, our understanding of this condition in children is limited. Covid-19 does present, in adults, as an inflammatory disease affecting a number of organs. We should investigate fully these children, with SARS-CoV-2, who present with a multi-system inflammatory disease to assess whether this is a presentation of Covid-19,” Smyth said in a statement Monday.

Judge Rules Virginia Indoor Gun Range Can Reopen Amid Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
An indoor gun range in Lynchburg, Virginia, will be allowed to reopen as majority of businesses in the state remain closed during the coronavirus pandemic after a judge cited the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms.

CNN) —  An indoor gun range in Lynchburg, Virginia, will be allowed to reopen as majority of businesses in the state remain closed during the coronavirus pandemic after a judge cited the Second Amendment’s right to keep and bear arms.  Lynchburg Circuit Court Judge F. Patrick Yeatts granted a temporary injunction on Monday for SafeSide Tactical, allowing its Lynchburg range to be open for business effective immediately.   The judge’s ruling comes as gun rights advocates in the state are fighting to reopen indoor gun ranges, which have been closed since March by Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat.  Protesters  across the country, including in Virginia, have also called for America to reopen its economy, as the  unemployment rate has climbed to a historic high  and businesses are taking a huge hit.   To slow the spread of coronavirus, Northam issued an  executive order  on March 23 closing “recreational and entertainment businesses,” including theaters, salons and indoor shooting ranges. Firearms retailers were allowed to remain open so long as they limit “all in-person shopping to no more than 10 patrons.” Northam recently  extended his order  through May 8.   The day after Northam announced the extension, SafeSide Tactical, along with Virginia Citizens Defense League, Gun Owners of America and Association of Virginia Gun Ranges, sued the governor, arguing that Northam’s order exceeded his executive authority and violated the Virginia state constitution.   On Monday, Yeatts wrote in his opinion that while Northam is “given great deference” and power during an emergency, state law limits his authority over the right to keep and bear arms.   “The Court understands the Governor’s desire to protect the citizens of our great Commonwealth. But in taking steps to stop the spread of Covid-19, he took a step beyond what is allowed” by the state law, the judge wrote.   SafeSide’s co-owner Mitchell Taylor confirmed to CNN that the range, which has furloughed about half of its staff, will reopen Wednesday.   Taylor said SafeSide will require face coverings for all staff and customers. Sessions will be limited to half an hour and one shooter per lane. Since there are only nine lanes, Taylor said, there will only be nine patrons at the range at a time. Safety officers will disinfect the area between sessions.   Asked about the ruling Monday during a press conference, Northam said that the state will consider their options as they move forward.   “No particular business has been singled out,” Northam said. “But businesses where the patrons would be at risk to be confined and whether it would perhaps be more than 10 people, we made the decision to close them.”   “So while I respect the decisions of our judicial system, we will look at our options as we move forward,” he added.   The office of Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement that it will “analyze the decision and decide how best to proceed.”   Taylor told CNN that SafeSide’s legal team is looking at the best options to reopen its Roanoke location and waiting to see if the state appeals the circuit decision.   “We feel confidently we can operate the business in a manner that’s safe for our customers and our staff,” he said.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced $1.6 million in grants for Maryland companies making personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.  Twenty Maryland businesses making face shields, masks, gowns and ventilators received grant money.   “Ramping up our supply of PPE is a critical building block in our state’s recovery plan, and we are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to secure these resources for our front line workers,” said Governor Hogan. “I want to thank and commend the local businesses who have shifted their operations and increased production to help us save lives and flatten the curve.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The $5 million program was created to help ensure there was enough PPE for frontline healthcare workers and first responders as well as other essential businesses.   “We quickly created this program to address an immediate critical need, and our business community has responded in a big way,” said Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly M. Schulz. “Many of these companies have had to rapidly ramp up production of these items, while others pivoted completely from their normal operations and came up with a creative way they could help, with some adding new jobs in the process.”   Here’s a list of businesses that received grant money.

The map is updated daily and also shows where each ZIP code ranks in the state.   One metric that stands out on the map is population density, Johnson said.   “It is not surprising that more densely populated areas are definitely the ones where we see the cases of coronavirus spreading more quickly,” he said.   Johnson hopes the map will serve as a useful tool to help people through these unprecedented times.   “In this environment where people are very afraid, there’s a lot of fear,” he said. “Providing the best available numbers we have can certainly help guide decisions.”   To check out the map,  click here .

3 Polls Open For Maryland’s Special Election While For The First Time Most Ballots Cast From Home
.W
A special election is being held Tuesday, April 28, to fill the vacant seat left by late Rep. Elijah Cummings in the 7th congressional district.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The impact of the coronavirus was felt in Tuesday’s special election to fill Maryland’s 7th congressional seat, vacant since the death of U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in October last year.  Voters in Baltimore City, Howard and Baltimore counties heading into the final hours of casting ballots to fill the seat had a whole new experience.   Sanitizer was supplied to poll workers and voters alike. Cones outside showed boundaries and paint lines on the floor inside marked off the distance voters must leave between each other and the poll workers.   These were the restrictions for people choosing to vote in person following the guidelines of social distancing imposed since the outbreak of COVID-19.   Maryland’s 7th Congressional District Special Election Is Tuesday. Here’s What You Need To Know   “It’s very different but I’m glad that they’re keeping everybody safe,” said a woman voting in Baltimore at Edmondson High School in Baltimore.   Voters have the choice between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik.   A woman wears a mask while voting in-person at Edmonson High School in the special election to fill the congressional vacancy left by the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings.   For Henry Kinard, it was a  matter of principle to vote in person.   “People died for us to vote, and coming out made me feel better,” he said.   By early afternoon, 150 people had voted, but the city was prepared for greater numbers.   “I erred on the side of a high number because of the number of ballots that had been returned was very low, so this morning I really expected a line here and I did not have that,” said Armstead Jones, Baltimore Board of Elections administrator.   Voters have been strongly enforced to use the ballots mailed to them.   But those who did not come to the poll were glad to have it.   Alvin Wilson had no choice but to cast his ballot in person since he said he did not receive one in the mail.   “So I called the election board this morning, and they told me to come to this address and that’s what I did,” Wilson said.   Jones believes this single race election to fill the congressional seat is a good test for what’s to come in the June primary.   “This is a good test with the June 2 election statewide, presidential election, and many candidates this a good test and there’s some things I see now that I would do differently,” Jones said.   It is likely to be a few days before the votes are tallied.   Nikki Charlson of the Maryland State Board of Elections said they prefer voters mail in their ballots but they understand not everyone will be able to do so.   Across the entire district, which includes parts of Baltimore and Howard counties as well as Baltimore City, there will be just three open polling places:     Edmondson High School, 501 North Athol Avenue, Baltimore;   Martin’s West, 6817 Dogwood Road, Windsor Mill; and   The Howard County Fairgrounds, 2210 Fairgrounds Road, West Friendship.     “Our strong recommendation is to use the mail-in ballot since it is the best way to keep people healthy,” Charlson said.   Voters will be able to register to vote in person if they need to.   Mail-in balloting isn’t new, but the scale of the election requires some big adjustments. Paper ballots have gone out and they need to be postmarked by Tuesday. No stamp is needed.   Polls opened at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.   As of 6:20 p.m. Tuesday, more than 110,000 mail-in ballots have been received. A total of 830 people voted in-person, including 364 in Baltimore, 283 in Baltimore County and 183 in Howard County.   Click here  for the latest election results.

Baltimore Doctor On Front Lines Of Coronavirus Pandemic Talks About Health Care Workers’ Mental Health

Methods of treating COVID-19 are changing rapidly and doctors are scrambling to keep up, said Dr. Bobby Burches, an anesthesiologist from Baltimore who is working at a hospital in New Hampshire amid the pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen the weary faces of the health care workers on the front lines who are risking their own health to save others.  Methods of treating COVID-19 are changing rapidly and doctors are scrambling to keep up, said Dr. Bobby Burches, an anesthesiologist from Baltimore who is working at a hospital in New Hampshire amid the pandemic.   “There are constant changes coming up in terms of what we are understanding as it relates to how this virus operates,” Burches said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The constantly-changing information and standards, as well as the need to protect oneself at all times, can lead to fear, Burches added.   “There’s just a hyper-concern about protecting yourself at all times which is palpable from the folks who clean the rooms down to every nurse and every physician you come in contact with,” he said.   The constant battle can also take a toll on health care workers’ mental health: over the weekend, New York City emergency room doctor Lorna Breen died by suicide while visiting family in Charlottesville, Virginia,  CBS New York reports .   Breen told her father she was dealing with countless patients, some who were dying before even leaving an ambulance.

Oceanside Cannabis In Pasadena Is Doing Drive-Thru Pick-Up For Medical Marijuana During Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
Patients simply place an order, get their medical cannabis status verified, and then get a text to come pick it up at a drive-thru window without ever having to leave their car.

PASADENA, Md. (WJZ) —  The state of Maryland and medical marijuana distributors are doing everything they can to make sure that patients have access to cannabis during the coronavirus pandemic while still keeping them safe from the virus.  One of those businesses in Pasadena, Oceanside Cannabis, is doing that through a drive-thru.   Patients simply place an order, get their medical cannabis status verified, and then get a text to come pick it up at a drive-thru window without ever having to leave their car.   Medical marijuana growers, processors and dispensaries can all still operate because they’re considered essential health care businesses in Maryland.   “Cannabis is medicine. It would be the same as denying somebody their insulin, there are folks that depend on this,” said Michael Maviglia, Oceanside Cannabis’ general manager.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Oceanside Cannabis opened its doors for the first time on Friday in the midst of the pandemic. Months ago, they had grander opening plans but had to quickly adapt when the coronavirus started infecting people across the state.   “Originally, the drive-thru, that window was sealed off and we weren’t going to use that at all. With the COVID, it seemed like, why not use this we have the opportunity,” Maviglia said.   Patients said cannabis is a very important part of their treatment.   “It’s part of my, um, pain management,” said Pasadena resident Jennifer O’Sullivan.   “The only thing I use for medication is cannabis. Nothing else,” said Pasadena resident Ben Clark.   “Especially now, with times the way they are, cannabis is known to relieve stress and anxiety, so it’s a very good time to have the availability and the access,” Maviglia said.   Maviglia said he’s hoping they can keep this drive-thru going after the social distancing restrictions are lifted.

Coronavirus Resources: Baltimore County Commits $10M To Support Small Businesses, Launches Contact Tracing Training Program
.W
The county is setting aside $10 million in new grant funding for small businesses and offering $100,000 in grants to assist professional artists, musicians and performers.

TOWSON, Md. (WJZ) —  Baltimore County is committing over $10 million in grants to protect jobs, small businesses and artists, County Executive Johnny Olszewski announced Tuesday.  The county is setting aside $10 million in new grant funding for small businesses and offering $100,000 in grants to assist professional artists, musicians and performers.   “Small businesses are a critical link of our county’s economy, and we must do all that we can to support them in meeting their basic needs during this crisis,” said County Executive Olszewski. “As we move toward economic recovery, these grants will provide a critical bridge to Baltimore County small businesses who have not received other forms of assistance.”   The Department of Economic and Workforce Development (DEWD) will administer the Baltimore County COVID-19 Small Business Relief Grants Program, which will award grants of up to $15,000 each to more than 650 Baltimore County-based small businesses on a first-come, first-served basis.   Additionally, the county is setting a goal to award at least 25 percent of grant funding to women and minority-owned businesses, they announced Tuesday.   The program, which is separate from the federal Paycheck Protection Program created as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, is welcome news to business owners like Chris Janoff at Stone Mill Bakery and Angela Tandy at Sassanova.   “We’re still opening, but for people not to be able to come and sit, (it’s) definitely a rude awakening,” Janoff said.   Tandy said while she has three stores across the state, her website only does a fraction of the business.   For now, since she never heard back from the federal government, she’s been forced to pay her employees out of her own bank account.   “I was one of the first to have my applications in and then I didn’t hear anything,” she said.   Grant applications will be accepted beginning May 11. To qualify, the businesses must retain at least half of the workforce they had before January 31, 2020, including two non-owner employees before the stay-at-home order.  They also must:      have at least two employees who are not owners or part-owners,   have no more than 25 employees per Baltimore County establishment,   demonstrate that they have lost at least 40 percent of their revenues since the Stay at Home order began,   have been in operation for at least one year as of January 1, 2020, and commenced operations by December 31, 2018 or earlier, and   certify that they have not received other forms of federal or state COVID-19 assistance or relief at the time of application, and   be in good standing and not in default with the State of Maryland and Baltimore County.     The county added grant funds must only be used for payroll, operating expenses, business lease or rent and inventory acquisition that is “vital” to the business, with at least 30 percent of the funds used to support payroll for non-owners.   They stipulated that funds may not be used for capital improvements or any personal expenses. If a business fails to reopen, all of the grant funds must be refunded to the county within 14 days.   For professional artists, musicians and performers, county executive Johnny Olszewski is making available the $100,000 for $1,000 stipends for up to 100 artists to help them with financial losses due to the pandemic.   Grants are first-come, first-served basis until the funds are gone and priority will be given to lower-income artists who $37,500 or less per year.   Applicants will submit a streamlined application, document their artistic portfolio, and must be adult Baltimore County residents over the age of 18. The application process will open on May 11, 2020 and details will be available on the Baltimore County  Office of Tourism and Cultural Arts webpage .   Artists can use these grants for recouping losses from canceled performances, art-related travel expenses, lost teaching opportunities and the loss of supplemental income for artists working in the service industry.   The county will also team up with the Community College of Baltimore County to launch a training program for contact trace investigators.   “At CCBC, we take pride in our ability to develop short-term training that can quickly prepare people for in-demand jobs,” said CCBC President Sandra Kurtinitis. “We are happy to participate in this partnership which will help secure the health and safety of our community as well as generate a pool of specially-trained candidates for new employment opportunities.”   Training will mainly be online and free for participants, with three training modules. The county’s department of health and human services anticipates they will need to hire 60 more contact trace investigators by July 2020 to fill the temporary positions.   There are 52 staff members working on contact tracing in the county.   For additional information on the training course, visit  www.ccbcmd.edu .

Coronavirus Latest: Around Half Of Maryland’s COVID-19 Deaths Have Happened At Nursing Homes, Data Shows
.W
The data shows just over half of the state's COVID-19 deaths and more than one in five of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state have been at nursing homes, assisted living facilities and correctional facilities.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  The state health department has released more detailed information about the number of coronavirus cases and deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  The data shows just over half of the state’s COVID-19 deaths and more than one in five of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state have been at nursing homes, assisted living facilities and correctional facilities.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The highest number of cases at a nursing home is 220 at FutureCare In Lochearn. The highest number of deaths at a nursing home is 33 at Sagepoint Nursing and Rehabilitation in La Plata.   The 220 cases at FutureCare in Lochearn contribute to the high number in northwest Baltimore’s 21215 zip code, which has the fifth-most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state at 343.   With nursing homes hit hard by COVID-19, Jennifer Holmes is worried about her 85-year-old grandmother Jannette Johnson. Johnson, a resident of FutureCare Cherrywood in Reisterstown, was recently diagnosed with the virus.   “When I spoke to her yesterday, she was not feeling well,” Holmes said.   She recounted learning about the diagnosis through a phone call on Sunday.    “I was a little panicked when I answered the phone,” she said. “They let me know it wasn’t an emergency and explained to me that they had gone through and done a mass testing and that my grandmother had tested positive.”   Holmes said she has had difficulty getting more information.   “Just getting any answers is not easy. We need to know especially in nursing homes where you’re dealing with the elderly, and that’s affecting them far more than it is younger people. It’s important to know what’s going on,” she said. “My grandmother is 85 and she has underlying conditions. This is not good.”   The 471 fatalities reported statewide in Maryland’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities are more than half of the state’s total.   Other states have been providing detailed information on nursing homes for weeks.   Baltimore City is also releasing nursing home case numbers. There are 291 infections and 23 deaths. The data is part of an expanded set of information on  Baltimore’s website .   Maryland has created “strike teams” of medical professionals to respond to troubled nursing homes. These teams have been called in to help at Sagepoint, Pleasant View and FutureCare Lochearn.   There have also been 49 confirmed cases at the Prince George’s County Jail, where  inmates have sued the county  over its response to the virus. The county has sought to have the lawsuit thrown out.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

People May Be Able To Spread Coronavirus To Pets, Maryland Vet Says

More research is needed, though, to determine how animals are affected by COVID-19 and if they may play a role in spreading the virus.

QUEENSTOWN, Md. (WJZ) —  A dog in North Carolina appears to be the first dog in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus, leading officials to caution humans with COVID-19 to distance themselves from their pets if possible.  CBS News reports  the dog named Winston is apparently the first pooch to test positive for the virus. The test was done as part of a study by Duke University.   Earlier this month, a tiger at a New York zoo also tested positive for the coronavirus,  CBS New York reported .   More research is needed, though, to determine how animals are affected by COVID-19 and if they may play a role in spreading the virus.   “We may learn more and what we say in a couple of weeks may be different in what we said right now,” Dr. Marianne Bailey with Queenstown Veterinary Hospital told WJZ Tuesday in the wake of the report.   Until more is known about the transmission of the virus between pets and humans, Bailey and the CDC say pet owners should limit their furry friends’ interactions with other pets and people outside the home, keep cats indoors when possible and avoid dog parks.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “In the current environment that we’re living in, and the way we’re living, our pets are quarantined at home with us, and it does seem that people can pass coronavirus to their pet,” she said. “We have not seen it pass it to people or pass it to other pets at this point.”   If a pet owner tests positive for the virus, Bailey said they should try to have another person in their home take care of their pet if possible.   Luckily, it seems that when pets do contract the virus, their cases are mild, Bailey said.   And in a challenging time, Bailey said people should continue to love on their furry friends who can be a good support system.

A Michigan man who serenades his neighbors with "God Bless America" two times a day says he'll keep singing until the state's stay-at-home order is lifted.

OTSEGO, Mich. (CBS Local)  — A Michigan man who serenades his neighbors with “God Bless America” twice a day says he’ll keep singing until the state’s stay-at-home order is lifted.  David Youngs has been carrying his microphone and speaker out to his front porch in Otsego everyday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m., rain or shine, since Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued the stay-at-home order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on March 24.   After setting up, he steps onto his porch steps and begins to sing.   “‘God Bless America’ is really a prayer,” he told  WOOD . “I just thought it would be a way of praying over the neighborhood, of bringing people together.”     The song "God Bless America" echos through a neighborhood in Otsego at 1 p.m. daily since the stay-at-home order. https://t.co/TsGyCxSlhq   — WWMT-TV (@wwmtnews)  April 23, 2020     The retired Kalamazoo Central High School teacher and former pastor said the singing carries on what he has always done.   “I love to inspire people,” he says.   Neighbors say the daily serenade helps them feel less isolated during the stay-at-home order.   “I love it. When I see that flag, too, that blesses me. It makes me…,” Dianne Timmerman says as she pauses to take in the emotion. “Anyway, I love it.”   “It’s a comfort,” says Matt Grile. “You hear it and you know your neighbors are out, and they’re okay.”

Costco Will Start Requiring Customers To Wear Masks Starting May 4
.W
Costco is requiring customers to wear face masks or coverings in its stores beginning May 4.

(CNN) —  Costco is requiring customers to  wear face masks or coverings  in its stores beginning May 4.  The company is the largest US retailer to enact the rule, which is aimed at helping prevent the  spread of Covid-19 . Costco said the face coverings must be worn “at all times” in the store and will not serve as a “substitute for  social distancing .”   There are Costco locations in Glen Burnie, Middle River, Elkridge, Owings Mills, and Beltsville.   Certain exemptions are applied, including for customers under 2-years-old and people who can’t wear one because of a medical condition. Costco announced the changes Wednesday on its website.   Costco has enacted a number of changes to its stores as shoppers flock to big box stores for  necessities during the pandemic . Other changes include earlier closing times, limiting the number of guests a member can bring and giving first responders and healthcare workers  priority admittance into warehouses.    Walmart said in a statement to CNN Business that customer and employee safety is a “top priority” and it’s recommending, not requiring, customers wear face coverings. In March, the retailer began  taking workers’ temperatures at stores  and warehouses before their shifts and also made medical masks and gloves available for employees who want to wear them.   Several, but not all, US states  are requiring shoppers to wear masks when they visit essential businesses. Earlier in April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommended people wear face coverings  in public, but it’s not yet required.

A Giant Asteroid Flew By Earth Wednesday, Close Enough To See By Telescope
.W
An asteroid estimated to be 1.2 miles wide flew by Earth early Wednesday morning, close enough to see on a telescope.

(CNN) —  An asteroid estimated to be 1.2 miles wide flew by Earth early Wednesday morning, close enough to see on a telescope.  The asteroid is called  52768 (1998 OR2) , and it was first spotted in 1998. On April 29, it will pass within 3,908,791 miles of Earth, moving at 19,461 miles per hour. That’s still 16 times farther than the distance between Earth and the moon.   The flyby happened at 5:56 a.m. ET, according to NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. The center tracks Near-Earth Objects, or NEOs, that could collide with Earth. They have been tracking this particular asteroid for 20 years, according to NASA.     You can watch it on  The Virtual Telescope’s website . Gianluca Masi, founder and scientific director of The Virtual Telescope in Italy, has been tracking and imaging it for some time.   If it did impact Earth, the asteroid is “large enough to cause global effects,” according to  NASA , back when the asteroid was first discovered.   And if an asteroid could be aware of such things, it appears to be wearing a face mask in deference to the pandemic, according to new images from Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.   “The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,” said Anne Virkki, head of planetary radar at Arecibo Observatory, in a statement. “But since we are all thinking about Covid-19, these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.”   Arecibo Observatory is a National Science Foundation facility managed by the University of Central Florida. A team of experts has been monitoring this near-Earth asteroid, among others. The observatory is supported by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Program and has been analyzing asteroids since the mid-’90s.   During the pandemic, scientists at Arecibo are continuing to make their observations on behalf of planetary defense. In line with social distancing, they have limited the number of scientists and radar operators at the facility, and they’re wearing masks during observations.   The asteroid was classified as a potentially hazardous object because it’s bigger than 500 feet and comes within 5 million miles of Earth’s orbit. The experts at Arecibo can monitor the asteroids and use observations to determine their path in the future to see if they pose a risk to Earth.   “The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,” said Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory, in a statement. “In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.”   It’s the largest asteroid expected to zip by Earth within the next two months, but it’s not the largest ever.   That honor belongs to the asteroid 3122 Florence (1981 ET3), which flew by and luckily missed colliding with Earth on September 1, 2017. It will make another pass again on September 2, 2057. That asteroid is estimated to be between two and a half and five and a half miles wide.   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

A neighborhood in Utah is fighting over Christmas lights that a homeowner said he put up to to honor medical workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

SARATOGA SPRINGS, Utah (CBS Local)  — A neighborhood in Utah is fighting over Christmas lights that a homeowner said he put up to to honor medical workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.  Jeff Noorda, who lives in the Legacy Farms neighborhood of Saratoga Springs, still has Christmas lights strung up around his house. But the lights are all blue to pay tribute to healthcare professionals in the battle against the coronavirus.   “We’ve got hundreds of thousands of people across the country and the world that are dedicated to going to work regardless of their safety,” he told  KSL . “It’s my one little way of saying thank you.”   But Noorda’s homeowner’s association says the lights were suppose to be down by March 1 and sent him an email saying he has to take them down or face a $50 fine.     It’s 4 months past Christmas, but a Saratoga Springs neighborhood has been fighting over Christmas lights that a homeowner said he put up to to honor medical workers. https://t.co/3qnfbqSbhP   — KSL (@KSLcom)  April 28, 2020     “Here we are in these unrealistic times, and to get a letter for having lights on my house to say, ‘thank you,’ I was actually very shocked,” he said.   Joey Duckworth, president of the Legacy Farms HOA, said Noorda never asked for permission to keep the lights up and sent a very angry email after he was asked to take them down.   “The tone of the email that we received was so aggressive in nature and so combative that we didn’t feel sincerity in what he was actually indicating,” he said.   Noorda acknowledges that he may have broken the neighborhood rules.   “Sure there’s rules that we all have to abide by, but these are times that nobody has gone through before,” he said.

Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department has made several criminal arrests during the coronavirus state of emergency and closed several cases.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department has made several criminal arrests during the coronavirus state of emergency and closed several cases.  According to Harrison, officers have seized 165 illegal firearms and made 124 gun-related arrests since March 15. Some arrests were related to drug activity, robberies and other violent acts.   “Even during the midst of COVID-19 handling, the men and women of the Baltimore Police Department remained committed to protecting and answering the call service to the citizens and residents of Baltimore,” the commissioner said Wednesday morning. “Since the beginning of the state of emergency, our officers have continued to patrol the streets with astounding resolve.”   Detectives have arrested 19 murder suspects and 10 non-fatal shooting suspects, as well.   Harrison said the city police how has a homicide clearance rate at 60%, which is significantly higher than what it was at the end of 2019.   Detectives also arrested 84 robbery suspects including 67 adults and 17 juveniles.   “While we continue to make great strides in reducing crime, this success is not ours alone,” Harrison said. “We want to thank our communities for their continuing to step up and come forward with much-needed information to help us close these cases.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Survey: 43% Of Americans Admit To ‘Comfort Buying’ While Social Distancing
.W
About 58 million Americans are spending more money while social distancing, according to a new survey by WalletHub.

(CBS Local)  — About 58 million Americans are spending more money while social distancing, according to a new survey by WalletHub.  The personal finance website says it conducted a survey from April 13 to April 17 to see how the shopping habits of millions of Americans have evolved during this time of crisis.   “58 million Americans are actually spending more money while social distancing, despite being able to go out less, in large part because many people are participating in ‘comfort buying’ or shopping as a way to relieve stress and boredom,” WalletHub wrote in its  report  published Wednesday.   Many people are shopping to ease stress, according to the survey, which found 43 percent of Americans have participated in “comfort buying” due to social isolation.     58 million Americans are spending more money while social distancing. See the full results of WalletHub’s latest survey here:  https://t.co/Yf6lkolvgK   #coronavirus   #covid19   #socialdistancing   pic.twitter.com/99P4gsJUvU   — WalletHub (@wallethub)  April 29, 2020     “As consumers, we are reprioritizing our needs and shifting buying patterns from purchasing transportation, vacations, and dining in restaurants to more social media, more streaming entertainment, and more food from grocery stores,” said Joyce Shotick, PhD, an associate professor at Judson University.   “These substitutes give us the impression that we are spending more, but in reality, we are spending more on certain items because we do not have to buy others,” she added.   “Comfort buying” does come with some stress, however. 57 percent said they are concerned about package safety. And 60 percent are also concerned about the safety of having food delivered during the pandemic.   The survey also found that people are using entertainment and drinking to take the edge off. Americans are said to be spending the most “non-essential” money on entertainment (29 percent) and alcohol (23 percent). That’s followed by clothing, beauty products, electronics, toys and exercise equipment.

There's a new way to file for unemployment in Maryland after the system was inundated with calls and emails last week.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  There’s a new way to file for unemployment in Maryland after the system was inundated with calls and emails last week.  The state’s Division of Unemployment Insurance’s website and call centers had an unprecedented volume of users after many Marylanders were furloughed or laid off from jobs with non-essential businesses.   “We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience during these uncertain times,” the unemployment office said in a statement. “Please be assured that Maryland does not have a waiting week like many other states do. No matter when or how they file, Marylanders become eligible for benefits starting after the day after they separated from employment.

Coronavirus In Baltimore: Through His Lens, Photographer Captures Impact Of COVID-19 On City Life
.W
A professional photographer from Baltimore is using his passion to help paint a picture of what life looks like now as the world comes to a standstill thanks to the coronavirus pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Instead of snapping pictures at networking events, weddings and parties, a Baltimore photographer is now capturing a crisis nobody was ready for.  James Trudeau has been a photographer in the city for around 10 years, often taking photos at events and functions. Lately, he’s been shooting empty streets and masked faces in an effort to document history.   Through his lens, he said it’s a sad story.   “It’s unfortunate I have to document this story in history,” he said, calling it interesting but also depressing.   His black-and-white snapshots show a once-busy city that has become a ghost town and the lives of everyday residents trying to live their lives amid the pandemic. He has taken a series of photos of people wearing masks, hand washing, empty streets and what life looks like now.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     While so much has changed, some of Trudeau’s photos show what remains the same.   “This little boy, he must have been 9 or 10, (was) riding a scooter. He had his mask on, he has a police badge, fake handcuffs and he’s just still being a kid,” Trudeau recalled.   A black-and-white photograph shows a young boy riding a scooter through Baltimore amid the coronavirus pandemic.

He has to get decked out in personal protective equipment and take precautions he has never had to take before to make sure he is protected and not carrying the virus out into his personal life   The new protocols are a daily “in-your-face” reminder of the danger.   “I can’t hug my kids until I take a shower and make sure I haven’t carried anything with me,” he said.   The desolate Baltimore Trudeau once saw filled with life, makes him yearn for brighter days ahead.   “I am looking forward to capturing the weddings, the networking events, the corporate events, so the best thing people can do is stay home, social distance, do what you gotta do until this can be over,” he said.   Billboards with some of Trudeau’s pictures are on display on rotating billboards around Baltimore through this weekend.

Md. Unemployment Claims Employee Says It’s Frustrating To Work On The Other Side Too As Residents Struggle To Claim Unemployment

Jason Suggs works at the unemployment claims center in College Park and said it's also frustrating working on the other side.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Since its launch on Friday, Maryland’s unemployment website has been plagued with problems.  For weeks, residents have been saying how frustrating it is for people trying to get through to someone at the unemployment offices, waiting for hours.   Jason Suggs works at the unemployment claims center in College Park and said it’s also frustrating working on the other side.   “On Friday, we rolled out a new application that allows Marylanders to file all types of claims entirely online,” Suggs said. “Unfortunately, we were not trained on the system until the night before its launch and a couple of hours in, the site crashed.”   RELATED COVERAGE:     After Weekend Of Technical Difficulties, New One-Stop Md.

He described an office short-staffed after states made cost-saving cuts to public services.   “We can’t be short-staffed when communities are counting on us,” He said.   Suggs said the system is flawed.   “We are facing an unemployment insurance system that is riddled with red-tape,” Suggs said.   He shares the story of one man crying to him on a call.   “A gentleman who tearfully described how he and his wife no longer have money to buy food for their four children. He shared this with me as I explained to him that after filing for six weeks and he finally got someone on the phone that he is ineligible for unemployment based on a technicality,” Suggs said. “By the end of the call, I was in tears as well.”   Suggs said people calling in oftentimes wait five hours just to speak to him.

Coronavirus Latest: New One-Stop Maryland Unemployment Site Launches; Issues Mostly Fixed, Hogan Says
.W
The new one-stop Maryland unemployment that launched Friday has been fixed after reporting multiple issues earlier in the day, Gov. Larry Hogan said.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  The new one-stop Maryland unemployment that launched Friday has been fixed after reporting multiple issues earlier in the day, Gov. Larry Hogan said.  At a news conference Friday afternoon, Hogan said the site was down for around an hour Friday morning after launching at 7 a.m.   The governor added around 35,000 Marylanders have logged on to the site since it launched and 15,000 new claims were filed. Later Friday evening, officials updated those numbers to more than 44,000 active accounts and 19,000 new claims as of 5:15 p.m.   Despite that, Hogan said he was “very frustrated” the vendor that the state worked with to create the site wasn’t prepared for the volume of users who tried to log on.   “We’ve expressed that frustration to this outside vendor that developed the website,” Hogan said. “They put — I think — 100 people on it this morning to try to get it fixed. They did get it back up online; I think there are a couple of glitches still throughout the day, but it’s performing much better, and we’re going to hold their feet to the fire to make sure they get all the glitches worked out.”   The new website is designed to make it easier for people to apply for unemployment insurance in the state. For weeks, newly jobless Marylanders have reported issues with filing for unemployment insurance as the state said it was overwhelmed by the number of applicants.   The site now allows anyone who’s eligible for benefits, including CARES Act benefits and those previously required to file by phone, to file online. It also allows the self-employed to file for unemployment.   Hogan said before the site launched, they had 40,000 calls backing up into their call center.   Earlier in the day, Marylanders trying to access the Division of Unemployment Insurance’s were greeted with the following message:   “Despite rigorous testing of our new BEACON One-Stop application, the vendor we partnered with is experiencing temporary issues with the system due to the volume of claimants accessing the site simultaneously. The outside vendor is working hard to resolve the issues. Please check our website later this morning for updates.”   In a statement Friday night, the labor department said it will continue to watch for potential glitches over the weekend.   More Than 45K Unemployment Claims Filed In Maryland Last Week; New Filing System Launches Friday   More than 45,000 Marylanders applied for unemployment last week, according to statistics reported Thursday.

Ocean City, Maryland's beach and boardwalk will remain closed through at least May 15 or when Gov. Larry Hogan lifts his stay at home order, town officials said Wednesday.

OCEAN CITY, Md. (WJZ) —  Ocean City, Maryland’s beach and boardwalk will remain closed through at least May 15 or when Gov. Larry Hogan lifts his stay at home order, town officials said Wednesday.  In addition, rental restrictions will be extended through May 22. The inlet parking lot will also remain closed through the 15th.   “Governor Hogan’s Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery laid out a path to gradually and responsibly reopen the economy, while also protecting the health and safety of our residents,” said Mayor Rick Meehan. “The plan intends to move rapidly, but not recklessly.

If we all continue to work together over the next few weeks, hopefully we will be welcoming everyone back sooner rather than later.”   In a  four-page memo  sent to the mayor and city council ahead of a work session Tuesday, City Manager Doug Miller wrote that while there will be changes, they still hope to welcome visitors this summer.   “Based on what we know and admittedly based on what we hope for there will be a Season in 2020 even if different from what we have known in the past,” he wrote.   “Our hope is that July 4th will be the new Memorial Day and that the July, August, September portion of the Season will resemble typical Seasons,” the memo reads.

Coronavirus Latest: Johns Hopkins Creates Team To Help COVID-19 Patients Deal With Psychological Effects Of Virus
.W
Johns Hopkins is working with coronavirus patients to also help them recover from the psychological effects of the illness like post-intensive care syndrome.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  For the more than 1,600 people currently hospitalized with COVD-19 in Maryland, it’s not just about fighting the virus but also the psychological effects that come along with it.  Critical COVID-19 patients are dealing with anxiety from having difficulty breathing and being in a ventilator. They can also suffer from something known as ICU delirium, said Dr. Megan Hosey, a clinical psychologist who works with ICU patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital.   “ICU delirium is kind of scary,” she said. ”(They have) difficulty tracking where (they) are and what’s happening to (them) and in the worst-case situation they tell us a little bit about hallucinations and delusions they experience.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Even after beating the disease, there can be physical, mental and emotional symptoms remaining. This is known as post-intensive care syndrome.   “Something kind of special about our COVID patients is ours are telling us when they’re heading home they might be a little bit worried about things like COVID stigma, the fear of loved ones and the people around them becoming ill, and they’re also afraid of infecting other people,” Hosey said.   Because COVID-19 is a relatively new disease, they’re still working to see how PICS affects COVID-19 patients. Dr. Hosey said it affects up to 70 percent of people who live through a critical illness, and one thing that helps is getting back to activities typically done before the illness.   Also there to help is Johns Hopkins’ new outpatient clinic designed specifically for COVID patients. It’s made up of pulmonary doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists and rehab psychologists. They call them the Post Acute COVID Team or PACT.   “The good news is that we know about this now and so that there are rehab measures that we can put into place to try to help people recover,” Hosey said.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has given Maryland approval to provide new meal assistance to all children who would receive free or reduced-price lunches if not for school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the state’s congressional delegation said Wednesday.  The Maryland Department of Human Services estimates that about 427,000 children will benefit from the program.   Maryland is one of 12 states whose plans have already been approved.   The delegation issued the following statement in a news release:   “Maryland students have lost primary access to healthy and nutritious food provided by their schools at the same time as food insecurity has spiked as a result of the pandemic. The state plan approved today will allow families to directly purchase food to feed their children, supplementing the free emergency meals being distributed by Maryland public schools. As a delegation, we are committed to working together to ensure that this and other forms of relief created through the Families First Coronavirus Response and CARES Acts make their way to Maryland families as swiftly as possible.”   This funding comes as a result of the CARES Act, which provided $8.8 billion in additional funding for child nutrition programs in order to ensure children receive meals while school is not in session.    Since the temporary school closures began on March 16, Maryland schools and agencies have been providing free emergency meals to children 18 years and younger.   As of April 25, Maryland local school systems have served more than 6.4 million meals across 698 meal sites.   Like regular SNAP benefits, P-EBT benefits will be issued via EBT card to households of children who would have received free or reduced-price meals.   Monthly assistance will be calculated based on the daily rate of $5.70 per child for each day that the child’s school was closed in a particular month.

Wine Shops Prove Essential During Coronavirus Pandemic: ‘Definitely Seeing People Buying More’
.W
From Table Wine in New York to Quarry Wine & Spirits in Baltimore, wine stores hold on as customers seek refuge from coronavirus.

PIKESVILLE, Md. (WJZ) —  Many stores have been temporarily closed during the coronavirus pandemic. Wine and liquor shops, however, have been deemed an essential business in much of the country and remain open. For those who have been quarantined for weeks, especially with kids, it’s easy to understand why. Alcohol can offer the illusion of escape when, really, there is no escape.  As Ernesto Vega, owner of Table Wine in Jackson Heights, New York, recently suggested, “It has proven to be a way for people to unwind and deal with their stress.”   In stressful times, a want can seem more like a need. Cutting off access can create its own dangers. Pennsylvania initially closing all its liquor stores led people to seek out their alcoholic beverages elsewhere. According to Michael Fishman, a co-owner of Quarry Wine & Spirits in Pikesville, Maryland, which is less than 40 miles from its northern neighbor, “people are going across the state line. Travel is exactly what you don’t want people to be doing in a situation like this. And they were crowding stores. There’s a demand for beer, wine and spirits in a time like this. And not satisfying them in a community can be dangerous.”   Strictly speaking, alcohol isn’t needed to survive like, say, food. Grocery stores are obviously essential, as are banks and pharmacies and gas stations. While the definition of ‘essential’ can be a little loose, sellers of wines and spirits don’t make the rules. They do, however, have to conduct business in an extremely restrictive  economic climate .   Business, so far, has been good for wine shops, or at least better than what could have been. Some of it resulted from a general initial uncertainty about just what the coming weeks held. “There was a bit of a panic in the beginning,” recounts Vega about his experience at New York’s Table Wine. “People… they didn’t realize that we were going to be able to stay open. Business those first couple weeks was very brisk. There were a few days that almost felt like the holidays as far as business.”   Fishman at Quarry Wine & Spirits in Baltimore has noticed a similar level of urgency among many of his customers. Then again “We’re definitely seeing people buying more,” he said. “The customer count is about the same, but the average sale is up.”   Increased sales, combined with additional free time spent inside, may very well point to heightened consumption. Certainly broad stay-at-home orders create ample time for distraction. And anecdotal evidence from social media suggests drinking has become a quarantine pastime.   What types of wines are people turning to to fill the hours? At Table Wine, “they’re more of the value wines,” says Vega. “We have the 12-[dollars]-and-under table. They definitely sell a lot. Some of the more expensive wines that we usually don’t sell as much, sometimes people are going that route as well. But overall it’s definitely a little bit value-oriented, things that people are used to.”   Another explanation for steady wine sales could be the need for comfort. Many consumers are seeking out comfort foods as a way to find some security in nostalgia. Familiarity is probably also a factor for wine consumers who just want to drink what they know.   Regardless, price is always a factor in an uncertain economy. “Some people are being a little bit more economical because times are difficult,” notes Fishman of Quarry Wine and Spirits. “Some people who are maybe use to going out to dinner more often find it to be not as expensive, so they’re splurging a little bit on the wine. It’s been a little bit of both.”   Selling these essential wines to wanting consumers has led to some logistical challenges. Social distancing must be maintained at all times, so neither Table Wine nor Quarry Wine & Spirits allow customers in their store. But location is also a factor.   Table Wine is located on a once-busy shopping avenue in a Queens neighborhood where people tend to shop on foot. Without that foot traffic, and without an app, the telephone becomes the lifeline. “The best thing, if you’re doing it for pickup, is to call,” says Vega. “We’ll figure out what you want, figure out your order. We will take your credit card information to process everything there over the phone, and we’ll have your bottles waiting. No one is allowed in the store, so we do have a bench outside blocking our entrance-way. When you do walk up to the door, we’ll notice you outside. We’ll open the door, ask you your name. We’ll ask you to back up. We’ll put your items on the bench, and then we’ll back up. You pick up your items.”   This coronavirus six-foot two-step changes when cars are involved. Quarry Wine & Spirits is located in a tastefully manicured strip mall and does much of its business through its website and app.   “We have an online portal, basically a store on our website. So basically customers can place an order and [give us] the time. And we have it ready for them. And we can bring it to their car, curb-side pickup.”   Going to this model almost exclusively has presented yet more challenges. Quarry Wine & Spirits was in the process of transitioning to a more robust website and app when the world changed. The new systems is “…a lot more labor intensive for us to fill the orders because we’re pulling them all ourselves.”   Busy employees can be a positive sign. And things are so busy at Quarry that they’ve had to hire additional associates to help with the workload, even as the  jobless rate  sinks deeper into double digits. Optimism is hard to come by these days. Wave after wave of bad news threatens to drown us all. But wine stores remain open and supported by their customers, proving their essential nature in these difficult times.

Maryland officials secured approval from the USDA for a new program to help feed 427,000 students affected by the coronavirus-related school closures.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Maryland officials secured approval from the USDA for a new program to help feed 427,000 students affected by the coronavirus-related school closures.  These children, who normally benefit from the free or reduced lunch program, will now be eligible for the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) Program. There’s an estimated $49 million in benefits.   Each child will receive $5.70 per day while the child’s school was closed, this includes retroactively obtaining benefits from March 16, when schools officially closed.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We are grateful to the Food and Nutrition Service of the USDA for their responsiveness and to the Maryland Department of Education and Local School Districts for their partnership in identifying and enrolling eligible students’ families in the Pandemic-EBT program,” said Maryland Department of Human Services Secretary Lourdes R. Padilla. “Additionally, we thank Governor Larry Hogan, who has led the way in thinking strategically and has championed our determined efforts to explore every opportunity that can help vulnerable Marylanders during this crisis.”   March, April, and May benefits will be issued in June, and Pandemic-EBT benefits will continue to be issued for the duration that schools are closed due to COVID-19.   “While local school districts and agencies are distributing meals at over 600 emergency sites across the State, this additional P-EBT benefit will help sustain students and their families through the COVID-19 pandemic crisis,” said Dr. Karen B. Salmon, State Superintendent of Schools. “This federal-state-local partnership led by the Department of Human Services will dramatically help maximize the nutritional well-being of children in Maryland.”   Any Maryland household that has SNAP and qualifies for the Pandemic-EBT benefits will receive the additional benefits on their existing EBT card. If you’ve lost your EBT card, call the Maryland EBT Customer Call Center at 1-800-997-2222 to have a replacement card issued.

Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott Proposes Relief For Renters During Coronavirus Pandemic

Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott introduced a package of bills Tuesday at the City Council’s virtual meeting that would provide assistance to renters during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott introduced a package of bills Tuesday at the City Council’s virtual meeting that would provide assistance to renters during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Scott introduced the Baltimore City COVID-19 Renter Relief Act and a resolution requesting federal action in Congress to provide direct rental housing assistance.   “Residents across Baltimore pay rent. During a global health and economic emergency unlike anything we’ve experienced before, and when so many don’t know where they will get their next paycheck, no one should be facing the added stress of a rent increase,” Scott said.   The Baltimore City COVID-19 Renter Relief Act would prohibit landlords from announcing rent increases during a declared State of Emergency and within the 90-day period after the State of Emergency is lifted.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     If enacted, the legislation would also prohibit fees for late payment or no payment of rent and all rent increases scheduled to take place during the State of Emergency. The ordinance will be scheduled for a hearing in the Land Use Committee.   The Council President also introduced a resolution that calls on Congress to create a direct Rental Housing Assistance fund to assist residents, protect landlords and help stabilize communities. The resolution was unanimously adopted by the City Council.   In early April, Scott introduced a resolution which called on the State to declare a moratorium on rent increases for the duration of the State of Emergency. It asked that the moratorium be retroactive to the start of the State of Emergency, and asked the State to declare a moratorium on late fees for rent.

SALISBURY, MD. (WJZ) —  Gov.

Kweisi Mfume Defeats Kimberly Klacik, Wins Special Election In 7th Congressional District
.W
The Associated Press has declared Democrat Kweisi Mfume the winner of the special election in Maryland's 7th congressional district.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The Associated Press has declared Democrat Kweisi Mfume the winner of the special election in Maryland’s 7th congressional district.  With 40 percent of the vote in, Mfume has just over 62 percent of the vote in Baltimore County and just over 59 percent in Howard County. He earned nearly unanimous support — just over 94 percent — in Baltimore City. Republican Kimberly Klacik has just under 38 percent of the vote in Baltimore County and just under 41 percent in Howard County.   Overall, Mfume has 73 percent of the vote compared to Klacik’s 27 percent.   Mfume, who held the seat prior to the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, said his first order of business is helping people through this dark time during the COVID-19 pandemic.   “I promise you that as your congressman, I will use every ability that I have to bring about that change,” he said in his victory speech.   Due to the coronavirus, the majority of voting was conducted by mail, officials reported.   Ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday will be counted, but they will be quarantined for 24 hours after being received to protect election workers. It’s not immediately clear when the final results will be posted.   In total, the state sent out more than 482,000 ballots.   COVID-19 was a significant barrier to campaigning, Klacik said.   “It’s been difficult, it’s been different because I’m more of an ‘in your face’ kind of person, I like to meet people one-on-one,” she said.   While three in-person voting sites were open, fewer than 1,000 people voted in-person as of 6:20 p.m. Meanwhile, the state reported receiving more than 110,000 mail-in ballots, and more will continue to come in over the coming days.   At Martin’s West, the sole in-person voting site in Baltimore County, voter Sharon Lee said she preferred the certainty of voting in-person over mailing in her ballot.   “I felt like my vote would be counted,” she said. “If I mailed it in, it may get misplaced in the mail or not get counted so I know if I do it personally, it’s done.”   Kenneth Brown, who worked on Mfume’s campaign, said the coronavirus made this one something quite different.   “I work a lot of campaigns, been involved in a lot of campaigns, and in my lifetime this is different,” he said. “Who knows where it goes from here? Is this the new norm?”   Mfume will now run as the incumbent in the state’s crowded June 2 primary election.   Click here for the latest results .

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Whether it’s a Zoom meeting, or just a lot of Netflix, more time at home means more screen-time. One thing you may not realize, it’s impacting your posture and skin.  Dr. Natasha Sandy wants to help everyone be polished from the inside, out.   Her practice in Howard County, Maryland is closed, but thanks to TeleHealth, she can still treat up to 20 patients a day.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Poor posture, lack of sleep and skin flare-ups are the main issues she’s treating right now.   So, here’s what you can do. If you’re sitting for more than four hours—especially in front of a screen—you can put yourself at risk of blood clots.   Sandy said keep your blood moving by taking a break to walk, stretch and encourage good posture with a supportive chair or by rolling a towel to use as support.   “Yoga is something that we call a moving meditation, so you’re getting the physical stretches to stretch the body, to strength the abdominal core, but you’re also getting the mental quieting of the mind,” she said.   Dr. Sandy said many patients right now are experiencing insomnia because of the rigorous lifestyle change.   Another problem is isolation skin. More breakouts, itchiness and dryness—mainly triggered by stress. Allergies, and even overeating—are directly linked to COVID-19, Sandy said.   Sandy said people are now more interested than ever with how to take care of themselves from the inside out, which is her ideology.

It includes:     $175 billion in Educational Stabilization Funds to be distributed to the local level through the Title I formula   An additional $13 billion for the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)   $12 billion in additional Title I program funding   $2.0 billion for E-Rate, and emergency infrastructure funds that include public  schools     “The Council’s request to Congress is fully aligned with the needs of students not only in Baltimore  City  but also our peers in urban school districts nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed  City   Schools  to employ extraordinary measures to provide students with learning experiences regardless of neighborhood, economic status, or other needs. Meals, computers, and learning technology are stretching our budgets in ways we could never have anticipated,” Santelises said. “We are supportive of the Council’s request because it reflects what many school districts are feeling. Baltimore  City  Public  Schools  knows we have the support of our congressional representatives, and we are hopeful their colleagues respond to the plea of school districts nationwide.”   City Schools have 80,000 students in its system, all who are on a distance learning curriculum.

Annapolis Small Businesses Petition To Shut Down Streets When Restrictions Lift, Bring Shops To Streets To Increase Business
.W
As businesses remain closed across Maryland, many shop owners are wondering what restrictions will be in place when they’re finally able to open their doors.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  As businesses remain closed across Maryland, many shop owners are wondering what restrictions will be in place when they’re finally able to open their doors.  A few business owners in Annapolis are trying to make sure they have the best chance of surviving, when that time comes.   Lisa Bolter, the Co-Owner of the Red Red Wine Bar, said since closing their doors on March 15, their focus has been on one thing.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “All of our thoughts, all of our ideas, all of our sleepless nights are about how do we reopen and what that’s going to look like for us,” Bolter explained.   One thing that seems all but certain is that restrictions will be in place when many businesses do reopen.   “The idea of opening at 40 percent is a little scarier than not being open,” Bolter said.   That’s because the money they would make wouldn’t cover the expense of being open.   To compensate, Bolter isn’t just thinking outside the box, she’s thinking outside the building.   She would like to shut down Main Street, in Annapolis, for a few hours each night to allow them to put tables outside.   “Depending on who you are, and where you are, that could give you up to 10 extra seats, that makes up for a huge difference,” Bolter said.   This Isn’t just for restaurants.   Fern Elliot thinks it would be beneficial for her boutique, Lilac Bijoux.   “I would love to put some racks out there,” Elliot said. “People would probably feel safer to walk to it and look at it and have more space for everyone.”   A petition started in favor of the idea. It garnered 500 signatures in just 24 hours.   The city already shuts down West Street on Wednesday nights in the summer for “Dining Under the Stars.”   The idea of allowing other streets to do the same is an idea the newly created Small Business recovery task force can get behind.   “It’s the kind of event I could possibly be a drawl, to bring people to the city, so it’s definitely something that could happen,” Stephen Rice, the city’s Economic Development Manager and Co-Chair of the Committee, said.   In total, that committee is made up of nearly four dozen people from various backgrounds.   They will be working with business owners to try to get things back to normal as soon as possible, while seeking help from the local state and federal governments.

Orrstown Bank Officials Meet With President Trump About Paycheck Protection Program
.W
Orrstown Bank took a trip to the White House Tuesday to discuss how the Paycheck Protection Program is helping small businesses across Maryland and Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  Orrstown Bank took a trip to the White House Tuesday to discuss how the Paycheck Protection Program is helping small businesses across Maryland and Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This week, the Small Business Administration made $310 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funding available to small businesses across the country to pump money into the struggling economy.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     It’s a program that’s kept local businesses stay afloat   “It allows people, employees, small businesses to come back to keep going during this hard time,” Luke Bernstein, Orrstown Bank’s Executive Vice President, said.   It’s the second round of the program, and the bank has helped Maryland and Pennsylvania business owners get $370 million in commercial loans in just two weeks.   “We did more small business loans in 14 days than we did small business loans in our entire 101-year history,” Bernstein said.   Bernstein added that’s why he was asked to go and meet with President Donald Trump to discuss the impact of the program on dozens of local businesses.     “To take all of those collective stories down to the highest office in the land was pretty humbling,” he said.   With the help of Orrstown, Keith Williams received $900,000 for his business, Northbay Adventure. It’s an outdoor education program for kids in North East Maryland.   Williams works with schools to stay in business, but that all changed when the COVID-19 pandemic started.   “Our business is based on school students coming to us, and so as soon as schools closed down, we had no revenue coming in,” he said.   Williams said because of it, they’re able to pay and employ their 140 staff members through June. Its also allowed them to maintain their property and even invest in online programs.   “We’re extremely grateful that we have the opportunity to continue doing meaningful work,” he said.

‘You’re Risking Your Life’ | Employees At Amick Farms Concerned Over Recent COVID-19 Outbreak At Poultry Plants

Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday a new testing site would be opening in response to outbreaks at poultry processing plants along the Eastern Shore.

SALISBURY, Md. (WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday a new testing site would be opening in response to outbreaks at poultry processing plants along the Eastern Shore.  WJZ spoke to some of the poultry workers Thursday who expressed concern surrounding the recent COVID-19 outbreak at these plants.   Two women, who wished to remain unidentified out of fear, are employees at Amick Farms in Hurlock.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “They have never shut down once to thoroughly clean the building,” they said.   “They were selling face masks to employees when they should have just been provided,” they added.   Maryland has at least 262 confirmed COVID-19 cases associated with poultry workers, but there’s still a consumer demand for meat.   Coronavirus Latest: State Opening Testing Site At Perdue Facility In Salisbury Amid COVID-19 Outbreak In Maryland Poultry Workers   “Any disruption or interruption in processing at our poultry processing plants could lead to significant national supply chain issues,” Gov. Hogan said.   State epidemiologists, the CDC and FEMA are responding to the Delmarva Peninsula in response.   “We are opening a testing site at Perdue Stadium in Salisbury,” Hogan added.   One worker said even if employees test positive, they’re still coming back into work.   “They are calling people and asking them to come back within maybe a couple of days,” the employee said. “You have some people that are coming back within a day or two.”   Amick Farms corporate offices in South Carolina said they are providing “each team member with appropriate PPE” and are conducting daily thorough cleanings at all its farms.   Employees, however, still feel like they’re left in the dark.   “You’re coming here, you’re risking your life,” an employee said. “I feel like we should be informed more this is real serious.”   WJZ reached out to Amick Farms about what these employees had to say.

A Look Inside A Johns Hopkins’ Acute Care Unit Nurse’s Life During The Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
“It takes a toll because you have this PPE on all day and you can’t really interact with the patients. We’re so disconnected because we are used to sitting down and talking face to face and you can’t do it now,” she said

BALTIMORE (WJZ) –  Behind layers of personal protective equipment, Kathleen Bailey is just trying to make it through the coronavirus crisis in the acute care unit at Johns Hopkins.   “It’s just a very different way of life at work now,” said Bailey who told WJZ the hardest part has been not being able to connect with people because they all have to stay distant and cover their entire faces.   “It takes a toll because you have this PPE on all day and you can’t really interact with the patients. We’re so disconnected because we are used to sitting down and talking face to face and you can’t do it now,” she said   Since 2007, Bailey has been working at Johns Hopkins. She works in a unit with 24 beds and right now, they are all occupied with severely ill COVID 19 patients.   Some of the serious cases die while at the hospital and Bailey said the staff at Johns Hopkins has tried to let family see their loved one before they pass.   “It’s very difficult to do that but we have been able to, but it’s still an end of life situation and its terrible,” she said.   Working extra hours at the hospital, on the front lines of this fight since the outbreak began, now with new protocols and coming home to a family who needs her care, Bailey said it is a lot to handle.   She showers at the office and leaves her scrubs there to be washed so she does not expose her family. Bailey said, “that takes an extra half hour to hour so I’m missing out on that time being home with my family and then I come home and its immediate ‘mom mode.’”   Bailey said though the struggles have been many, and the challenges have been constant the community has rallied around health care workers unlike ever before and she said they appreciate the love and support. “I can probably speak for everybody; never have I done this job for the praise or the thanks, but it is really nice to see health care workers getting recognized,” she said.   Gov. Hogan’s orders to stay home and social distance yourself is helping, Bailey said, keep the numbers inside hospitals manageable. She encourages people to continue following safe practices so this pandemic can be over.

COLUMBIA, Md. –  Calls to the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center have gone up 33% this month.  The Columbia center answers calls for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Maryland’s 2-1-1 service, and its own crisis hotline. All three hotlines have seen increases in volume the past month.   “I think there’s a great sense of unknown right now across our community, across our country,” Grassroots Executive Director Ayesha Holmes said. “Right now, we’re all going through something.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Grassroots’ 50 crisis counselors are all now working from home as hotline calls are being routed to their personal phones.   “We planned for it for a tornado or something where our building might be down. We never imagined a pandemic,” Holmes said. “The intensity is different. People are really sensing the stress around COVID.”   Rachael Bender is one of those counselors working from home.   “It’s a shared experience that everyone’s dealing with, but also everyone’s circumstances are really different,” Bender said. “People are definitely under a lot of stress, losing their jobs, not knowing when they’ll be able to work again.”   Walk-in counseling has been suspended, Bender said. But, all other services, including crisis intervention teams, are still active. Many calls are coming from families, with a caller as young as seven years old.   “They can call and just say, ‘Hey I need to vent for 5 minutes. My parents are really ticking me off,’ and just get it out. That’s cool. That’s fine. We’re here for that, too,” Bender said. “Don’t feel about doing whatever you need to do to get through it, because these are really crazy, unprecedented times. We’re doing our best to figure it all out.”   For more information about  Grassroots Crisis Intervention, click here .

5 Rules For The Best Tofu You’ve Ever Had, From Vegetarian Chefs
.W
Add some tofu to your dinner menu with these expert tips from top vegetarian chefs.

Tofu  gets a bad rap as a flavorless hippie food. Far too many people botch the preparation and end up with spongy, bland blobs, but that doesn’t mean tofu’s to blame. These 5 rules for the best tofu you’ll ever eat will prove that point.  Look, tofu isn’t like other proteins. The delicate soy-based ingredient must be handled with care. You can’t just chop it up, sprinkle on some salt and pepper, and toss it in the oven, expecting it to taste good. There’s an art to cooking tofu, and once you learn it, you’ll see how this versatile ingredient can take on a tender texture and pack a punch of flavor.   Related Reading:  12 Easy Ways to Eat a More Plant-Based Diet   Want to learn how to make tofu that actually tastes good? We asked  vegetarian chefs  to reveal their secrets to making insanely delicious tofu. Here are their tips and tricks.   1.

We’ve put together an easy guide to explain the different types of tofu. So if you’re embarking on a #veganuary journey of discovery and feeling a bit bewildered, or if you just like reading about tofu, we hope this will help! Link in the bio #vegan #tofu #tofupress #plantbased #poweredbyplants #vegansofinstagram #vegansofig #veganlife #whatveganseat   A post shared by   Tofuture  (@tofutureltd) on  Jan 10, 2020 at 8:45am PST         The biggest mistake people make with tofu happens not in their kitchen, but at the grocery store. They buy the wrong type of tofu for their dish. Tofu comes in a few varieties based on their density, ranging from silken to regular, firm, extra firm, and super firm.   “Each type has its own purpose, and it’s not one size fits all,” said Suzannah Gerber, vegan executive chef at Haven Foods and author of  “The Plant-Based Gourmet: Vegan Cuisine for the Home Chef.”   Silken tofu , commonly used in miso  soup , easily blends into things like custards and creams, she explained. Regular tofu works well for a crumbly  scramble , while the firmer varieties can be fried, sauteed, or baked into chewy meat-like protein. Make sure you get the right kind of tofu for the dish you plan to make.   2. Get the Water Out     Photo Credit: Amazon     Tofu typically comes packed in a container of water that keeps it fresh. While you can simply drain and use silken tofu as is, you’ll need to get the water out of the firmer varieties if you want them to taste good.   “ Pressing tofu  is key in getting the best texture and firming it up for cooking,” said  Amy Webster , a vegan chef who works with the  Humane Society of the United States  to train food service professionals at schools on cooking plant-based cuisine.   To press tofu, you can wrap it in a clean dish towel or paper towels and put it between two heavy objects (I use bulky cutting boards) for at least 30 minutes. You can also get fancy with a device specifically designed for pressing tofu (like  this one from Amazon ).     After it’s pressed, cut your block of tofu into medium-size cubes (I usually slice it in half length-wise, then cut each side into 16 equal-size pieces) to get it ready for cooking.   3. Make an Awesome Marinade     Photo Credit: Chowhound   Easy Asian Broiled Tofu     Marinating tofu can give it flavor from the inside out. But what should you marinate it in? The answer depends on which veg chef you ask, and comes down to whatever flavors you prefer.   “I like tofu best with Asian flavor profiles: ginger, garlic, shoyu, citrus, and sesame oil all work great,” said  Ann Ziata , a plant-focused chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education.   “I focus on enhancing the tofu with umami, so I’ll marinate it in soy sauce and a touch of  liquid smoke ,” said chef Caroline Concha of  Mohawk Bend , who turned the entire menu at  Beelman’s  pub vegan.   Related Reading:   12 Delicious Vegan Sauces to Put on Everything   “My go-to tofu marinade is soy, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and grated garlic,” said  Colada Shop ’s chef Mario Monte, who is a vegan.   Experiment with hot sauces, citrus juices, salad dressings, herbs, and spices to get the flavor you’re looking for, and let the tofu sit in the marinade for at least two hours (or longer, if possible!). Then, pop the tofu on a lightly greased baking sheet and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes, flipping halfway. Your efforts will pay off in highly flavorful cubes that can be added to salads, stir-fries, ramen, or simply eaten on their own.   4. Rub It With Spices—and Cornstarch     Photo Credit: Chowhound   Grilled Tofu Torta     While a marinade can help tofu develop flavor from within, tossing it in spices and other substances can enhance the texture and taste of tofu externally. Cornstarch helps it crisp up.   “For spicy tofu bites, remove tofu cubes from a hot sauce marinade and toss them in cornstarch seasoned with salt, garlic powder, and paprika, to make them extra crispy,” suggested Stephany Burgos, a vegan and executive chef at  The Wilson . “Heat the pan, add about a half inch of oil and shallow fry the tofu. Once crispy, remove the tofu from the pan and toss it in some of the leftover marinade.” You could also skip the marinade entirely, and instead use a dry spice rub and pan-sear the tofu for a crispy treat, said Guy Vaknin, executive chef at  Beyond Sushi .   5.

Silken tofu can also be turned into a dairy-free substitute for ricotta by putting it into a food processor with garlic, olive oil, sea salt, and rosemary, said chef-instructor  Olivia Roszkowski , who specializes in plant-forward cuisine at the Institute of Culinary Education.

O’s Pitcher Kohl Stewart Says Social Distancing In Clubhouse Is ‘Almost Impossible,’ Uncertain About Season
.W
The first month of the baseball season is wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but there's growing optimism that games could begin in the next couple of months.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The first month of the baseball season is wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but there’s growing optimism that games could begin in the next couple of months.  Many factors are still in play before any sport gets the okay to proceed, and Major League Baseball has multiple plans on the table.   Orioles pitcher Kohl Stewart is new to the team after starting his career in Minnesota. He’s given a lot of thought to what it will take for conditions to be safe enough for games to resume.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Stewart said he has concerns about how players share close quarters when they’re together, a challenge when trying to avoid the spread of COVID-19.   “What happens if one guy tests positive, and all 50 guys are around that guy?” Stewart said. “In the clubhouse, it’s almost impossible to maintain a six-foot distance. We’re all getting in the same hot tub together, or we’re all using the same trainer. It’s just really going to come down to: Do we have the amount of tests? And we test guys on a weekly basis. Hopefully we get to a point where that’s possible.”   Stewart emphasized that while he’s pessimistic, he hopes he’s wrong. He wants baseball back and wants to make his Orioles debut at Camden Yards this year.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Royal Farms Donates 20K Pounds Of Food To Maryland Food Bank
.W
Hunger is a continuing concern for Marylanders as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Hunger is a continuing concern for Marylanders as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.  The Maryland Food Bank stands ready to help with a new food supply.   The food bank received Thursday a generous donation from Royal Farms.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Traditionally, we get a million pounds of food from retailers that helps support the food bank,” Rick Condon, of the Maryland Food Bank, said. That number has significantly dropped.”   It’s nearly a 50 percent drop, which the food bank attributes directly to the COVID-19 pandemic.   “If you look at it, everybody goes into the supermarket, you see what’s going on in the supermarket,” Condon said. “There’s less food on the shelves, and that means there’s less food that makes its way here to us at the food bank.”   Royal Farms has traditionally had a relationship with the Maryland Food Bank with smaller donations, but it recently dropped off a trailer full of about 20-thousand pounds.   “We’re hoping it finds its way to the hearts and stomachs of those who need it,” Breahna Brown, of Royal Farms, said.   It’s anticipated that more people will find themselves in need. On average across the state, there are approximately 1.3 million people who are food insecure at any given time.   “That number has started to go up about 25 percent,” Condon said. “And you see tens of thousands of people currently hitting the unemployment rolls. We have anticipation that number is going to grow even further.”   Given that fact, there’s hope for more donations.   “We encourage all our corporate neighbors to do the same,” Brown said. “It‘s definitely going to take a village to turn this thing around.”   Another shortage at the food bank is the number of volunteers.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Rain or shine, Rolander Harris looks forward to her weekly delivery from Allison MacKenzie, a box full of fresh produce for free.  “I just thank her so much because it’s so well appreciated for those who can’t get out,” Harris, a patient at Saint Agnes Hospital, said.

Harris said she’s a pulmonary patient, and going to the grocery store gives her anxiety.   “I like it because it’s always a surprise,” Harris said. “You never know what’s going to be in there, and then I open it up. I’m like, oh good… this… that…”   “It gives me something to do to find new recipes, and I’m eating healthy,” she added.   The hospital said that this is a free program for their vulnerable patients who sign up, and they plan to keep delivering boxes of produce until this pandemic is over.

Maryland Native And Princess Cruise Lines Performer Stranded At Sea For Seven Weeks Due To COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
Emily Freeman is a performer for Princess Cruise Lines.

BOWIE, Md. (WJZ) —  Emily Freeman is a performer for Princess Cruise Lines.  The Bowie native boarded a ship on March 8 and hasn’t set foot on land since.   “Just being isolated in my 230 square foot cabin on a ship is fine, but its not a permanent solution,” Freeman said.   She said days later, the CDC ordered all passengers to disembark, but it didn’t have any guidelines for crew members.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     She’s currently quarantined on the Emerald Princess.   In her free time, Freeman has been taking TikTok videos in her cabin.   Emily’s mom, Nancy, has been in touch with Senator Ben Cardin, who is urging Princess Cruise Lines to act quickly so American citizens can get home.   “It’s more the unknown and not knowing and the rumors of them maybe going off around the world that is scary,” Nancy Freeman said.   Currently, the Coastguard is monitoring 120 cruise ships in U.S. waters with about 80,000 crew members   The reason why Freeman — and others — can’t disembark is because of a CDC order that prohibits cruise ship workers from staying in a hotel, using public transportation, taking a commercial airline flight or interacting with the public for 14 days upon arrival on shore, regardless of how long they’ve quarantined on board.   The CDC tells WJZ, in part:   “The CDC permits cruise ships to disembark their crew members if the cruise line signs an attestation stating that the cruise line has complied with all requirements for the safe disembarkation of the crew.”   The CDC said it has not received this information from Princess Cruise Lines for the Emerald Princess.   “I shouldn’t be forced to have to wait it out here,” Freeman said.   Freeman said that the captain on her ship provides an update every day at noon. While the information continues to change, Thursday’s update said that they would be able to go home sometime next week.   WJZ reached out to princess cruise lines and have yet to hear back.

Not knowing what the future brings is a regular part of every day life for children in foster care, but the coronavirus pandemic has made everything even more uncertain.

ROCKVILLE, Md. (WJZ) —  Not knowing what the future brings is a regular part of everyday life for children in foster care, but the coronavirus pandemic has made everything even more uncertain, with some now finding themselves without a place to live.  Rob Scheer is the Co-Founder of Comfort Cases in Rockville, a non-profit that provides children in foster care with bags full of essentials – to ensure they don’t have to carry their belongings in garbage bags – an unfortunate reality that Scheer himself had to face.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “I aged out of the system. I became a homeless teenager in northern Virginia,” he said. “Living on the streets my entire senior year of high school.”   He said right now, another major problem for children is abuse that’s going unnoticed because they’re not in school, and teachers who would normally notice signs of abuse, are not able to report it.   “We’re going to start seeing the numbers of abuse that they’ve already seen that in local hospitals of kids coming in with severe abuse,” Scheer said.   Others are aging out of the system without a place to go.   “Go to a shelter? Where there’s 60, 70, 90, 100 people. We know we’re supposed to be social distancing, but no one’s talking about these kids,” Scheer said.   He added that right now, more than anything, these children are wanted and loved.   “We want children knowing we love them,” Scheer said.   To  donate to Schaffer’s non-profit, click right here .

Dozens rallied in downtown Annapolis Saturday, calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to remove some restrictions the state has put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Dozens rallied in downtown Annapolis Saturday, calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to remove some restrictions the state has put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  Protesters drove through the city’s downtown with signs and flags calling for Maryland to be “re-opened” and for restrictions on everything from boating to attending church services to be lifted or modified.   Those at the rally said they’re frustrated with the mass shutdowns of major aspects of everyday life.   “It’s time to get out and breathe fresh air and to start building up our immune system,” protester Ruth Brown said.   She added the restrictions have hit her family hard.   “My son-in-law may lose his business,” she said. “It’s closed and I’m very concerned about all that.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The event was organized by a group called Reopen Maryland.

The petition reads in part:   “We acknowledge the tragedy caused by COVID-19 and appreciate that it is a significant public health concern. However, the economic, social and educational disruption caused by shutdowns is guaranteed to cause significant, even greater, harm, leading to increased deaths, economic disruption, loss of livelihood, and educational challenges for Marylanders and their families, and far less disruptive means of managing the disease can be employed.”   “The businesses, the businesses they just got to open, and if they only let five (people) in at a time or whatever, they want people to stay safe and they want their employees to stay safe,” protester Katrina Venuto, a nurse, said.   Restrictions like those should be made at a smaller scale and not by the state government, she said.   “It’s so sad to see all these small businesses being shuttered and I think it’s a decision for a personal business if they can open safely or not,” she said.   The governor has said the number of cases in the state is still rising and the state is not quite ready to reopen just yet.   A spokesperson for Hogan said the event was peaceful and no arrests were made despite the governor’s order prohibiting large gatherings.     The Maryland Capitol Police worked alongside various police agencies to provide traffic control and ensure an orderly demonstration at today’s rally in Annapolis. The demonstration was peaceful and there were no arrests.   Thank you to the Capitol Police for keeping people safe.   — Mike Ricci (@riccimike)  April 18, 2020     As of Saturday morning, state health officials reported at least 12,300 cases of COVID-19 in Maryland and 463 deaths from the virus.

We have all had to postpone routine appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic, that includes getting our teeth cleaned.

OWINGS MILLS, Md. (WJZ) —  We have all had to postpone routine appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic, that includes getting our teeth cleaned.  When Dr. Joanne Block Rief was forced to close her Owings Mills dental practice on March 19 she said some of her patients were in mid-treatment.   “Because we weren’t able to finish their treatment, they’re starting to have problems,” she said. “And we have to decide are these problems emergencies.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     When Crossroads Dental Arts does reopen, Dr. Block Rief said it’ll be very different than it was before with increased social distancing and much more personal protective equipment.   “We’re also looking for head coverings, shoe covers, face shields and all those different kinds of things that we haven’t always had to purchase,” she said.      Until then, with the stay at home order in effect, Dr. Block Rief prepared oral healthcare kits so that you can still stay on top of your cleanings.   “It’s super important during this time to have good oral hygiene. We can only do so much with what we have at home,” Helene Lutz said.   Anyone in the community can go to Crossroads Dental Arts on Crossroads Drive in Owings Mills. You’ll be handed a care package with a set of instructions and tools, something to hold you over until your next appointment.   Donations are welcome, and go to the worthy cause of “Weekend Backpacks,” an organization fighting hunger in Baltimore City.   “If patients are not able to come to the dentist the plaque accumulation and gum disease can affect their overall health,” Dr. Block Rief said. “We want to help our patients before it becomes too late.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

‘Graduate Together: America Honors The High School Class Of 2020’ Coming To CBS On May 16th
.W
'Graduate Together: America Honors The High School Class Of 2020' honors this year's graduating seniors on CBS and other networks.

LOS ANGELES (CBS) –   XQ Institute ,  The LeBron James Family Foundation , and  The Entertainment Industry Foundation  have announced that they are joining together to pay tribute to the Class of 2020 in a one-hour multimedia special event,  Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020 , on Saturday, May 16 (8 PM ET/PT, 7 PM CT). LeBron James, Bad Bunny, Charli D’Amelio, Dixie D’Amelio, Chika, YBN Cordae, Loren Gray, H.E.R., the Jonas Brothers, Brandan Bmike Odums, Ben Platt, Henry Platt, Jonah Platt, Megan Rapinoe, Yara Shahidi, Lena Waithe, Pharrell Williams, Malala Yousafzai, and many more will participate in #GraduateTogether.  As coronavirus has prompted the cancellation of high school graduation ceremonies, some of the nation’s biggest media companies will honor the more than 3 million high school seniors across the country with a joyful tribute to the Class of 2020. CBS, ABC, FOX, and NBC will simultaneously air the special along with leading entertainment, social media and streaming platforms—including Complex Networks, Facebook App, Instagram, PeopleTV, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube—which will all create dynamic experiences for each of their unique audiences.   “We learned early on in our work with students and families in Akron that education is so much more than academics. It’s about a shared experience, a journey we’re all on together—students, parents, educators, community members, and everyone around them. With that not being possible right now, we’ve been working to find ways to help families get through this really difficult time,” said LeBron James. “These students have worked incredibly hard for this and there’s no way we can let that go unrecognized. While this won’t be the graduation experience they were supposed to get, we hope we can still give them something special because they deserve it.”   Curated by high school students and educators throughout the country, with the support of the American Federation of Teachers, this national commercial-free broadcast will include a collection of commencement addresses, celebrity performances, and inspirational vignettes. #GraduateTogether is inviting students, educators, and families to submit their own videos and photos online for consideration to be included in the telecast. In addition, renowned artist JR and his global participatory art project, Inside Out, will invite high school students everywhere to share their portraits in celebration of being part of the graduating Class of 2020. And because high school graduations are local, local television stations will also feature custom breakaways to celebrate the achievements of high school students in their own communities.   This crisis has created a critical void across the nation’s most underserved and challenged communities. Schools play a vital role in every neighborhood and are often the source of stability in a young person’s life, providing education, meals, and a place to stay safe. Led by Entertainment Industry Foundation, The LeBron James Family Foundation and its I PROMISE School, and XQ Institute, #GraduateTogether is partnering with  DonorsChoose  and  America’s Food Fund  to help fill this void. DonorsChoose gives public school teachers working in high-need communities the opportunity to request the materials and resources their students need to keep learning. America’s Food Fund provides funding to hunger-relief organizations, ensuring students who rely on school-lunch programs still have safe, consistent access to meals during COVID-19.   “‘We miss you’—that’s what I hear America’s educators telling their students over and over again,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Our country’s teachers and support personnel have been on the front lines keeping students engaged, comforted, and supported during this time of incredible upheaval. Educators want their kids to be okay. And even if we are physically apart, we are eager to celebrate our students’ accomplishments alongside parents, family members, and caregivers as we try to bring this school year to a meaningful close. We are grateful to all our teachers and school staff and proud to join in this effort to bring together education professionals from across the country and honor graduates as they embark on their next journey.”   Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020  will be broadcast commercial-free on Saturday, May 16, 2020, at 8:00 PM ET/PT, 7:00 PM CT on ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC.

Promise Heights Works To Help West Baltimore Families Thrive As COVID-19 Pandemic Continues

One organization serving children and families in a west Baltimore neighborhood said their closer now than ever, even though they're physically staying apart amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  One organization serving children and families in a west Baltimore neighborhood said their closer now than ever, even though they’re physically staying apart amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  For nearly 11 years, Promise Heights has been serving the west Baltimore neighborhoods of Upton and Druid Heights.   It started as a place-based initiative in 2009 by the University of Maryland School of Social Work to improve educational outcomes, ensuring families are healthy and successful.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Our goal is really to see our community members thrive, and be empowered to just grow and be the best they can be,” Linda Callahan, Counselor of Promise Heights, said.   But now more than ever, during the COVID-19 pandemic, their support is needed the most.   “There’s a lot of struggles already happening in that community,” Callahan said. “But they’ve been so resilient, our families. They’ve had to adapt to teaching their children and having them at their house every day, all day.”   The non-profit organization is still holding to their promise, offering resources and support for children and families in need through zoom meetings.   “With these groups, we built a community and we’re able to help out one another,” Vonzella Parker said. “If there may be something about food, someone may need food or certain things”   Parker is a mother of four and said its so important now to let other families know they’re not alone.   “It’s awesome that we can get our points across to help one another still, even though we are social distancing,” Parker said.   Resources are also provided on Facebook for things like childcare supplies, food and even video lessons for children.   No matter how distant they need to be at this time, Promise Heights is committed to lending a helping hand in the west Baltimore community.   “I think this has provided an opportunity to maybe get a little deeper with the families that we are connected with, just because were kind of all struggling with this together,” Callahan said.

Tune in for an all-new episode of 'Blue Bloods' this Friday, May 1st at 10:00 PM ET/PT, only on CBS and streaming on CBS All Access.

Blue Bloods  will air a very unique season finale this Friday, May 1st at 10:00PM ET/PT, only on CBS and streaming on  CBS All Access . Due to the COVID-19 crisis production for the current season was halted prematurely, but the Reagan family still has one more new story to add to the show’s latest chapter.  CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke to series star Donnie Wahlberg (Danny Reagan) about keeping busy in quarantine and what it means to provide viewers an escape during these trying times.   MW:  Hey there Donnie, hope all’s going well for you during quarantine, s uper excited to talk to you today . H ave you been doing anything special to keep busy during this time ?     DW:  You know, t he first few days I was dealing with  one business catastrophe after another .   M y family’s in the restaurant business and w e’ re shutting down restaurants left and right and dealing with a lot of fallout from that . I t’s kind of weighing on me a little bit and I just kind of went on Instagram Live and clicked on  C lub  Qua r a ntin e  with  D-N ice one afternoon and t he music just made me feel a lot better and reminded me of who I am .     I ‘m not a person who gets stressed out or gets down . I  a lways put other people before myself .   T hat little musical experience kind  of  reminded me to get back to who I am .   I  immediately  wrote a song ,  called “ H ouse  P arty” which I recorded with  N ew  K ids On The  B lock ,  B oyz  2  M en and Naughty B y  Nature and  B ig  Freedia ,  Jordin Sparks .  The song’s  raised almost a quarter  million dollars   for  charity .     Jenny and I’ve been doing a lot of fun videos just to keep people smiling and laughing .   D oing our part in this time to help other people in any way we can .  I mean  we’re entertainers,  so we’re just trying to entertain and do it in a way that’s helpful to others .     MW:   M usic alone is such a great way to lift people’s spirits but the charity aspect adds a whole other dimension to it ,  really cool .     DW:   T hank you .  I couldn’t believe we actually pulled this all off ,  work ing  with all these other artists .   W e had to ship microphones around the country ,  but  I  made a point when I wrote the song to reach out to friends .  I didn’t want a big celebrity song full of people that I don’t even know just  be cause they’re famous .   I t’s people that we have relationships with ;  people we have a connection with .   M y brother ’ s in the video .   I t really is something that was from the heart and people who we have a connection with want to be part of  it. I’m  grateful to them for doing it .       MW:  Outside of music you also  have an episode of  Blue B loods  coming this week .  I’m curious though ,  this is the season finale ,  was that the plan or was that altered because of everything ?     DW:   I t was not the plan .   W e had three episodes to go after this one ,  but ironically this episode is probably the most appropriate season finale we’ve ever had .   I t’s probably the best season f i n ale  we’ve ever had .   I t’s  huge twist s  that turns the Reagan family upside down .   V ery  heart felt  and interesting to say the least  be cause it really is going to propel the show into next season .  I can’t wait to hear what the audience has to say about it .     MW:  Y ou mentioned the Reagan family ,  and a big thing for you guys is the big family dinner .   W hat do you think the Reagan family would be doing during this time ?  They are f irst responders so how woul this  r eal-life  situation effect them ?     DW:  I don’t think the  R eagans would be getting together for dinner .   T hey’d probably be exposed to a lot of people because they’d still be up there on the front lines ,  doing what so many brave men and women are doing right now   in the real world .   R eal life first responders are out there putting themselves on the line and I’d like to think the  Reagans  would be doing the same and they probably have to skip some Sunday dinners for everyone safety and for grandpa’s safety .     One  of the great things about working on  Blue Bloods  is seeing just how courageous so many men and women are when it comes to first responders .  I think in times of crisis like this we  see  and we appreciate what they do .   B ut it would be nice if we could come through this crisis with that same appreciation .   Not just first responders but  doctors ,  nurses ,  teachers you name it .  I mean there’s so many people  that  have shown their value and how critical they are to our society functioning .   I n people being safe and educated and taken care of .  I hope that somehow one of the small takeaways from this is the big ,  b ig  sacrifices so many people make for all of us .       MW:  R ight it feels like when these events happen there’s always a big push to say thank you and to appreciate them .   T hen six months goes by and  it  kind of fades a little bit and hopefully that’s something that can stick around .       DW:  Yeah it doesn’t have to be a lot. Just a dinner, h avin g  dinner with your loved ones .   W e grew up with our family members from the day we ’ re born .   T h ey’re  in our lives and we think you’re always going to be there and one day it’s taken away from us .   I t reminds us of how precious and fragile life is .   T he key though is to move forward and not forget that like we so often do .   H opefully we won’t this time .     MW:   The   R eagans wouldn’t be able to sit together ,  but I believe you and your  castmates  actually did have a  Z oom dinner al l  together ,  is that right ?  how’d that go ?     DW:  We did. We didn’t really  eat dinner ,  but we got the crew together for a virtual gathering .  I just got the idea from doing so much outreach to fans in my world of my band and stuff . S taying connected with them ,  I thought ,  what better thing to do than get the  R eagans together virtually?   A   Z oom conference is perfectly set up for a Reagan family virtual dinner ,  so we did it .     I t was great and it’s great for the fans of the show .   I t was great for us as actors we got the season cut  short,   so  we didn’t get to say goodbye to each other .   I t was a great way to check in and re-connect .  We also  celebrated Bridget  M oynahan’s  birthday which we never get to do because the shows always finish shooting by the time her birthday rolls so that was  great.     MW:  Very nice and a belated happy birthday to Bridget! L ast question before I let you go here ,  so as we kind of touched on a little bit before  Blue Blood’ s  new episode this week is the season finale .  What does it mean to you be able to provide people with an escape when they tune in for this week’s episode Friday night?   DW:  I think a lot of ways my whole career has been spent ,  since I was about 14 years old ,  being an entertainer . G iving people an escape ,  an outlet too ,  for whatever reason ,  just sort of get through  tough  times .   Blue B loods  came along at the height of the financial crisis, or just after it, p eople were staying home on Friday nights a lot more than they used to be . I t was a great escape for people then and I think it’s a great escape for people now .     A t its core  Blue Bl oods  is a show about family and values and service .  I think at this time ,  it’s a timely show because it just resonates .  I think people are thinking about sacrifice, t hey are thinking about service, t hey are thinking about putting other people first .   W e all miss our families ,  nobody is exempt from the ramifications of this awful time that we’re living in .   W e’re all feeling it in one way or another and anything we can do to  u nite even if it’s watching a TV show .   MW:  A lright well thank you so much  Donnie.   A ll the best and all the best to you and your family .   S tay safe man !   DW:   T hank you Matt, appreciate you .

.W
The Frederick County Public Schools system is honoring the Class of 2020 with a message on each of the high school stadium scoreboards.

FREDERICK COUNTY, Md. (WJZ) —  The coronavirus pandemic has cancelled many of the traditional events that we have come to appreciate each spring. Among those traditions is graduation ceremonies, a celebration of the accomplishments and hard work the senior class of that year has put in over the last four years.  For Frederick County Public School students who are part of the Class of 2020, their graduation may not be the same as previous years, but they will still be honored by their schools.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     ‘Graduate Together: America Honors The High School Class Of 2020’ Coming To CBS On May 16th   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Tonight at 8:20 p.m., the scoreboards at each public high school stadium will show a special message for the seniors and also all spring sports athletes whose seasons were cancelled.     Time  – 20:20 (symbolizing the class of 2020)   Score  – Home = 20, Visitors = 19 (symbolizing the class of 2020 defeating COVID-19)   Quarter  – 4     The school district is reminding residents that leaving the house to go and see these tributes at the stadiums would violate the current stay-at-home order. Instead, they suggest the public use the hashtag #FCPSClassof2020 to share messages honoring the students. Staff at each of the schools will share images of the scoreboards and tag the FCPSMaryland and FCPSAthletics accounts.

Coronavirus Latest: Payments To Child Care Providers Caring For Kids Of Essential Workers Up-To-Date, State Says
.W
Maryland's education department said it has caught up on all payments to child care providers caring for the kids of essential workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland’s education department said it has caught up on all payments to child care providers caring for the kids of essential workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.  On March 30, Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order creating a program that would allow select child care providers to get a waiver to care for the children of workers deemed essential during the pandemic. All other child care providers  had been ordered to close  by the end of the day on March 27.   Under the order, the State Board of Education would cover the cost of child care — $350 weekly for children under three and $250 weekly for children over three.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Providers, though, reported weeks-long delays in getting those payments, putting their ability to care for children in jeopardy.  On April 24 , Sue Kruhm, the owner of Peter Pan Learning Center in Howard County, said without the money they would only be able to keep their doors open for another two weeks.   On Friday, the education department said it has paid more than $29 million to child care providers this week alone and has caught up on the backlog of invoices from March 30 to April 12. Child care providers and family providers have also received multiple grants to help them cover their costs.

The Cash Register Is The Most Dangerous Place For Coronavirus Spread, Experts Say
.W
The cash register has emerged as the most dangerous place in the store, according to public health and worker safety experts.

(CNN) —  Sandra Kunz wanted to keep working as a Walmart cashier even as the coronavirus spread.  Despite a lung condition, the 72-year-old in Aurora, Colorado, needed to get her paycheck, according to her sister, Paula Spellman. Her husband, Gus, was injured and out of work, and the couple had bills due.   Kunz died on April 20  from complications related to the coronavirus, her sister said. Gus, who was also sick from the virus, died two days before his wife.   While it is unclear how the couple contracted the virus, Spellman said her sister had expressed concerns about customers at Walmart coughing on her at the cash register.   “I wish she didn’t work there. I wish she had taken leave,” Spellman said. “I get angry because she should have been more protected.”   Walmart says it has instituted several safety measures in its stores , including here in Maryland, providing masks and erecting sneeze guards, or plexiglass barriers, to protect its workers from the coronavirus.   The cash register has emerged as the most dangerous place in the store, according to public health and worker safety experts. Every item cashiers touch, scan and bag has been handled by customers and other workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says  it is possible that a person can get coronavirus by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it.   The job also entails being at arm’s length from customers all day rather than the CDC-recommended six feet, making socially distancing nearly impossible, these experts said. The risks for shoppers are heightened as they move toward the register, too. If a cashier is infected, the employee could spread it to customers.   “The cashier spot is still the most dangerous since every customer passes this area and stands there for some time while groceries are moving down the counter,” said Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Riverside.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     ‘Most exposure’   The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if they do not display symptoms, according to the CDC.   “Workers at the greatest risk are the workers with the most direct contact with other people,” said Brian Brown-Cashdollar, program director at the Western New York Council on Occupational Safety and Health, a worker safety advocacy group. Cashiers “have the most exposure.”   Spellman says that her sister expressed concerns to her about working behind the register without a mask. Walmart says it made masks available for workers in late March, including in Kunz’s store, and began requiring workers to wear them on April 20.   A spokesperson for Walmart said, “Our hearts go out to Sandy Kunz and her loved ones. Her loss shows the devastating impact of the COVID-19 virus.”   Walmart added that, in addition to offering masks to employees, the store had taken other measures earlier in March, such as adding social distancing markers and cleaning checkout lanes and cash registers more frequently. The store installed sneeze guards and began limiting the number of customers inside the store earlier in April.   Retailers have been stepping up their safety measures as the CDC’s guidance on the virus evolves. In addition to Walmart, Target, Kroger, Whole Foods and others have installed sneeze guards at checkout lanes and added social distancing markers in lines. Retailers are limiting the number of customers inside the store at a time and are sanitizing checkout stations frequently. Companies are also expanding the use of contact-free payment options so customers don’t have to touch screens or enter their pins.   Some public health experts and labor advocates believe the measures are not stringent enough to protect cashiers, other employees and customers. For instance, major retailers like Kroger, Target and Whole Foods are not mandating that customers wear masks, except in states and cities where they are required. And workers complain that the requirements are often not enforced.   Sneeze guards and self-checkout   While the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration says stores should consider opening up every other cash register to keep workers safe, this is not a requirement and many stores are not taking this measure, said John Grant, president of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers in California, which represents 20,000 grocery workers. Around 27% of the workers at the local who have gotten sick from the virus have been cashiers, Grant said.   Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, said cashiers “need N95 masks as much as health care workers.” He believes that all stores also need to give their cashiers face shields because many coronavirus carriers are asymptomatic. In China, stores are sanitizing cash, and the United States “should as well at some point.”   Cashiers also say limits on the number of customers inside stores are unevenly enforced and it’s hard to keep customers separated in lines. At Kunz’s Walmart in Aurora, for example, the local public health department briefly ordered the store to shut down in part because of complaints of “lack of social distancing” and “too many people in the store at one time.” The department has since allowed the store to reopen and said it has “good safety and health measures in place.”   The plexiglass barriers companies have put up are of limited help, some cashiers say, because customers lean over or around the barriers to talk to them.   “It doesn’t cover us properly,” said one Target cashier in Louisiana affiliated with the workers’ advocacy group Target Workers Unite who requested anonymity out of concern of retaliation. “There’s a considerable gap in the plexiglass on each register.”   A representative for Target declined to comment on the plexiglass but said “we have introduced dozens of new safety measures at our stores,” including reminding customers through loud speakers to observe social distancing rules.   “In any situation, if a team member feels uneasy about performing a specific task, we’d encourage them to have a conversation with their leader to determine if there are alternative tasks they could perform,” the retailer said.   Companies have expanded the use of self-checkout in recent years, but this also brings risks. “Self-checkout may make physical distancing a challenge because of the frequent need for customer assistance,” California’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration  says  in guidelines.   Workers have to clean down stations after each customer, retail employees say, and handling alcohol purchases is especially challenging. That’s because a worker has to come over to ask the customer for ID, the customer has to remove a mask, and then the worker has to check to make sure they match.   There are other concerns: “At self-checkout, guests tend to crowd you when they need help, even with social distancing reminders,” said a Target worker in North Carolina who is behind the cash register part time and also helps with self-checkout.

Coronavirus Latest: Maryland’s New Unemployment Website Adds Virtual Assistant Feature
.W
After a rocky launch for Maryland's new unemployment filing website amid the coronavirus pandemic, the state has created a new virtual tool to help people get answers to their unemployment-related questions.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  After a rocky launch for Maryland’s new unemployment filing website amid the coronavirus pandemic, the state has created a new virtual tool to help people get answers to their unemployment-related questions.  Even before the new site launched  a week ago Friday , Marylanders reported spending hours on the phone with no answer on the other end of the line.   The new Beacon One-Stop application was supposed to alleviate some of the long lines, but due to high volume, it crashed within hours of launching. Since then, the state has added a virtual waiting line for unemployment seekers.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The state’s latest effort to address the surge in unemployment filings due to COVID-19 is a virtual assistant that guides users through the application process and answers some of their questions.   Some Marylanders, including Towson University student Breia Lyons, say they’re still having problems and the fixes aren’t enough.   “It was just a robot asking me, ‘Oh what do you need help with?'” Lyons said.   Since its launch, the Beacon One-Stop application has seen more than 286,000 accounts created, 142,000 new claims submitted and 360,000 weekly claim certificates filed.   Gov. Larry Hogan has repeatedly apologized to those frustrated with the process, saying Wednesday “the buck stops” with him.   Still, Lyons is struggling to pay her bills. She lives with her disabled mother and spends hours on the site and making calls, hoping she’ll eventually get through to a person and get the money to pay her bills and buy groceries.   “I’m frustrated, I’m irritated, I don’t know what else I can do,” she said.   WJZ reached out to the Department of Labor about the concerns people have expressed in recent days; so far, they have not responded. In the past, the department said it’s been working around-the-clock to address problems with the website.

Flyovers in Baltimore will start at 11:30 a.m. and last around 15 minutes.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds will honor frontline healthcare workers and first responders battling the COVID-19 pandemic with formation flights in Baltimore, Washington D.C. and Atlanta on Saturday.  Blue Angels, Thunderbirds Honor Healthcare Workers And First Responders With Formation Flights Over Baltimore   Flyovers in Baltimore will start at 11:30 a.m. and last around 15 minutes.   RELATED COVERAGE:     What Time Will The Blue Angels, Thunderbirds Fly Over Baltimore Saturday?   Blue Angels, Thunderbirds Scheduled To Fly Over Maryland Saturday; Gov. Hogan Deems It Healthcare Heroes Day     The Blue Angels and Thunderbirds will first pass through Baltimore before heading through Towson and around Brooklandville. They will come back down through Roland Park and Hampden, then make their way through Essex and Rosedale.     They will end in Brooklyn Park, Linthicum Heights and Ferndale as they head toward Washington, D.C.     Captain Michael Brewer, a right wing with the Thunderbirds, will be one of those soaring in the skies above the region Saturday morning.   The routes, he said were picked to coincide with the locations of major hospitals.   “We’ve plotted out major hospitals, especially the ones they have been affected by COVID, and we’re going to do a fly-by,” he said.   In total, a dozen aircraft will fly over the city.   “You’ll see two delta formations is what we call it,” Brewer said.   Brewer hopes their tribute to those helping patients battle COVID-19 will put a smile on peoples’ faces.   “It’s not just us saying thank you: it’s the thousands of other people that are going to look above and see us flying in support to all jointly with one voice say, ‘Thank you,'” he said.   Maryland State Police said residents in the areas will be able to see the flyover from their homes and social distancing guidelines will be in effect during this event.   People should not be traveling to landmarks, hospitals or gathering in large groups to see the flyover, America Strong said.   In a joint news release, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force squadrons reminded spectators to follow these safety guidelines.   “Residents in these areas will be able to see the flyover from the safety of their home-quarantine and should maintain all social distancing guidelines during this event,” the release said. “They should also refrain from traveling to landmarks, hospitals and gathering in large groups to view the flyover.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Coronavirus Relief: More Than $9M Going Toward COVID-19 Housing Relief For Marylanders
.W
More than $9 million is being directed to COVID-19 housing relief for Marylanders for tenant-based housing voucher recipients.

WASHINGTON (WJZ) —  More than $9 million is being directed to COVID-19 housing relief for Marylanders for tenant-based housing voucher recipients.  The full Maryland congressional delegation, which includes U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone, announced the funding on Thursday.   The funding comes from the CARES Act, which is provided $1.25 billion nationwide for tenant-based rental assistance to help with the Housing Choice Voucher program. It includes $400 million for increased subsidy costs, which are paid directly to landlords and $850 million for administration and other expenses incurred by public housing authorities to “support or maintain the health and safety of assisted individuals and families, and costs related to retention and support of participating owners.   “The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant financial hardships for Americans – especially those in our most vulnerable communities,” the delegation said in a statement. “These new federal funds will help low-income Marylanders keep a roof over their heads at a time when they may be facing job losses and reduced income. Our delegation will continue to work together to ensure that federal assistance makes its way to the people who need it most.”   The new funding will also go to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.             PHA Name (Recipient)   Award Amount   City       Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis   $         55,770   Annapolis       Housing Authority Of Baltimore City   $    3,047,940   Baltimore       Frederick Housing Authority   $       165,388   Frederick       Housing Opportunities Commission of Montgomery County   $    1,522,342   Kensington       Hagerstown Housing Authority   $       117,832   Hagerstown       Rockville Housing Enterprises   $         91,244   Rockville       Wicomico County Housing Authority   $         31,242   Salisbury       Housing Authority of Prince Georges County   $    1,218,376   Largo       Elkton Housing Authority   $           6,216   Elkton       Housing Commission Of Anne Arundel County   $       300,992   Glen Burnie       Housing Commission of Talbot   $         19,686   Easton       Housing Authority of St. Mary’s County   $       217,532   Lexington Park       Housing Authority of Calvert County   $         94,956   Prince Frederick       Howard County Housing Commission   $       172,660   Columbia       County Commissioners of Charles County   $       158,178   Port Tobacco       Harford County Housing Agency   $       158,298   Bel Air       City Of Westminster Housing Office   $         44,106   Westminster       Housing Authority of Washington County   $         76,238   Hagerstown       Cecil County Housing Agency   $       103,824   Elkton       Carroll County Housing & Community Dev   $       107,040   Westminster       Baltimore County, MD   $       813,936   Baltimore       Queen Anne’s County Housing Authority   $         24,138   Centreville       MD Dept.

Coronavirus Latest: Baltimore County Doctor Fronts Nursing Homes $240K To Buy Personal Protective Equipment

The coronavirus pandemic has forced some organizations to take on roles they've never done before, but businesses aren't the only ones stepping up to the plate.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The coronavirus pandemic has forced some organizations to take on roles they’ve never done before, but businesses aren’t the only ones stepping up to the plate.  When a group of nursing homes needed money to secure personnel protective equipment, a private citizen stepped up to help.   While hundreds of parking spaces sat empty in a Columbia business complex, one office was very busy.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Our members need it desperately,” Kevin Hefner, of LifeSpan Network, said.   Cars loaded up on PPE gear that could save hundreds of lives.   “Nursing homes without masks or without gowns… without gloves, it’s a non-starter,” Hefner said.   LifeSpan is a network of about 300 senior living facilities in Maryland and Washington, D.C. Some have been hit hard with nearly half of the COVID-19 deaths in the state occurring at nursing homes and long-term care facilities.   When the network received nearly 200,000 masks this week, there was relief.   Finding the PPE was one thing, but coming up with the money on short notice was another, so Baltimore County Dr. Scott Rifkin fronted about $240,000.   “If you can get equipment into those buildings, you protect the patients,” Rifkin said. “In those buildings, you protect the staff in those buildings and you protect the community.”   An Owings Mills marketing company shifted its mission and located the large stockpile.   “We are working around the clock nationwide,” Scott Stein, of Strategic Factory, said. “We received an order in just yesterday from Hawaii. Everybody needs PPE, it’s a global issue.”   One shipment down and more to come.   “You can’t expect staff to come to work every day, put their lives in danger and not get the equipment,” Rifkin said.

FREDERICK, Md. (WJZ) —  A group of Marylanders opposed to Gov. Larry Hogan’s orders closing non-essential businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic drove from Frederick to Salisbury on Saturday as part of a demonstration calling on the governor to loosen restrictions on the state’s economy.  “Re-Open Maryland” held a similar protest in Annapolis  on April 18 , driving through the streets near the State House while honking and holding signs.

Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier Says Impact Of COVID-19 Pandemic Could ‘Decimate’ Hollywood
.W
Empty lots and studios are already making life very tough for those 750,000 people employed in the entertainment industry in California alone.

LOS ANGELES (WJZ) —  Empty lots and studios are already making life very tough for those 750,000 people employed in the entertainment industry in California alone.  They are without work, and nobody can guarantee when the lights, camera and action will resume.   Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier said that the COVID-19 pandemic has already had a big impact on Hollywood.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This is going to be a big deal,” Frazier said. “The summer shows that we are used to seeing, all those summer shows are usually competitive game-type shows, and they can’t shoot right now. When it really gets scary is in July when everybody comes back to start shooting for the fall season. That’s all your sitcoms and everything like that. It is going to be really tough if we cannot get folks back to work by July.”   Frazier added that the pandemic has left many people in Hollywood without work.   “How many people will be out of work because of this?” Frazier said. “That is something that nobody is thinking about on the economy. Even in our studio alone… the cameramen, the hair, makeup, wardrobe… all those folks are at home right now. They’re not earning a living. Hollywood could be decimated because of that. Because that infrastructure falls apart. The set designers… all those people. We could lose those people.”   Maryland is no stranger to the entertainment industry. House of Cards, The Wire and other shows were filmed in part right here.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

We’re All Glued To Our Screens Right Now, Here’s How You Can Protect Your Eyes
.W
One new estimate suggested that adults are spending more than 13 hours a day using screens, a spike up from 10 hours a day a year ago.

(CNN) —  With much of the globe now under coronavirus-related restrictions, we have never been so tethered to our screens — for work, to connect with friends, to unwind or to distract ourselves.  One  new estimate  suggested that adults are spending more than 13 hours a day using screens, a spike up from 10 hours a day a year ago.   With children  cut off from physically attending school , they are more reliant on laptops and tablets for online lessons and entertainment.   And with our new routines likely to have a lot more screen time for the foreseeable future, experts say it’s important to learn how to protect our eyes from suffering as a result.   While there is no evidence of long-term eye damage from extended use of smartphones, computer screens or other devices, prolonged use can sometimes lead to blurred vision, eye fatigue, dry or irritated eyes and headaches, according to  Moorfield Eye Hospital  in London.   Dr. Raj Maturi, the clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a retina specialist, called these symptoms “digital vision syndrome.”   He, along with the doctors at the Moorfield Eye Hospital, recommended a 20-20-20 approach — for every 20 minutes spent at a screen you must take a break and look 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.   “When you are looking at a close target, your eyes are just training that one muscle at all time, and looking into the distance can relieve it,” he said.   Don’t forget to blink   While it’s close work, rather than screen use per se, that strains our eyes. Dr Maturi said that looking at bright devices can make us blink less, which leaves our eyes feeling dry.   “When things are bright, we blink less. It’s behavioral. So we can train ourselves to blink more often and blink fully,” he said.   If you’re already suffering from dry eyes, he recommended the use of artificial tears. Moorfields Eye Hospital also suggested using a humidifier, as well as making sure your work station is set up correctly.   The top of your computer screen should be in line with your eyes and about 18 to 30 inches from where you’re sitting and tilted back slightly, the hospital  said in a blog post  in April.   Dr. Rachel Bishop, a spokesperson for the National Eye Institute, agreed that where your screen is positioned is important.   “If you are looking down, then your eyelid is shut a bit and you’re not having as much evaporation — which can help prevent dry eyes. If you’re looking up high, your eye dries much quicker,” she said.   Other steps you can take include dimming the surrounding lights so that the screen is brighter in comparison and cleaning your computer screen regularly to avoid dust buildup, which can obscure the screen and cause eye irritation.   If you or your children continue to have vision problems after making these fixes, experts recommended seeking advice from an ophthalmologist or optician as it could be a sign of an uncorrected eye problem like long-sightedness or astigmatism.   If you’re older than your late 30s and unable to see an eye care professional because of lockdown restrictions, there would be no harm in buying a cheap pair of drugstore reading glasses and seeing if they help, said Bishop.   “The focusing muscle in your eye changes as you age. You can focus up close when you’re 20 for hours at a time and have no problems. But that ability declines as you age,” said Dr Bishop.   “For people who aren’t eager to have a medical appointment, the first thing is to try on some low-strength, over-the-counter reading glasses. Hold up something to read and pick the lowest number you can comfortably read at the distance you like to work,” she said.   Blue light   Another potential concern is the “blue light” that digital devices emit, but Dr. Maturi said this affects our body clock, rather than our vision. But it’s something worth paying attention to — especially for kids who can get overstimulated easily.   “When we go outside we look at a blue sky, that’s blue light,” he said. “The issue with blue light is at night. It can delay your ability to sleep quickly,” he said.   He suggested that people turn their devices to night mode or use e-readers with screens that more closely resemble a physical book. The key was to look at how many nits a display had — a measurement of luminance or brightness, he added.   To protect kids’ eyes, parents should encourage them to spend as much time outside as possible — within restrictions that are in place where you live to prevent the spread of Covid-19.   The past two decades have seen a massive increase  in myopia or short-sightedness among children  — and while scientists can’t agree on exactly what has caused this rise and whether there’s any link to screen use, they do know that spending time outdoors, especially in early childhood, can slow its progression.   “We should know more in a few years when research comes up with more answers, but for parents they have a dilemma because the school is now brought into the screen and kids social engagement are now brought into the screen and kids are playing their games on a screen,” said Bishop.

Coronavirus Recovery: Maryland Delegation To Ask For Additional Stimulus Money For Baltimore City, Counties
.W
Baltimore mayor Jack Young and the Maryland congressional delegation held a virtual press conference Monday morning to ask for additional stimulus funds to help Baltimore city and other counties in the state with coronavirus-related economic losses.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore Mayor Jack Young and the Maryland delegation held a virtual press conference Monday morning to lay out why they are asking for additional stimulus funds to help Baltimore city and other counties in the state with coronavirus-related economic losses.  State, county, and city revenue has plummeted due to closures and costs related to COVID-19. It’s also affected the local economy and regional tourism as hotels, restaurants and other businesses have shut down.   “I was on the phone with [the Maryland delegation] early during this COVID-19 outbreak, and each one of them understood deeply, the potential damage to our cities and outcomes,” Young said.   Baltimore Mayor Jack Young Calls For President Trump To Give Stimulus Packages To Cities & States, Not Just Corporations   Young said the city relies heavily on tourism for revenue and the pandemic has really hurt that revenue source.   The U.S. Senate is reconvening this week and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said he will continue to advocate for Marylanders and it’s his top priority to help Baltimore city and other Maryland counties push forward after the virus.   “The federal government must step up, the health and welfare of the people of our state are directly involved in this, we’re gonna get through this,” Cardin said.   Most of the initial stimulus dollars were allotted directly for schools and to fight this virus, however, in order to recover, local leaders say they will need some more support. Also smaller municipalities, with less than 500,000 people, had to apply for the money and it’s a much more rigorous process to get the funds. So the delegation will ask for more flexibility and fight directly for municipalities so that they get some of the stimulus dollars.   Several cities and counties have said that if they don’t have the support they will have to make major cuts or layoff and furlough city workers, including some first responders, to make up the difference.   ‘Slap In The Face’ | Firefighters Union Says City Shouldn’t Be Discussing Layoffs, Furloughs During COVID-19 Pandemic   “[The] last thing that I ever want to do is lay off anyone because it adds to the stress that we’re facing here in Baltimore,” Young said.   Howard County Executive Calvin Ball and Montgomery County Executive Mark Erlich also joined the call to discuss what losses their counties are facing.

Coronavirus Latest: Maryland Sued Over Gov. Larry Hogan’s Stay-At-Home Orders

According to court documents, Del. Cox was set to speak at Saturday's Reopen Maryland Protest and was allegedly threatened with arrest if he attended the rally in Frederick County.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Three Maryland lawmakers, along with pastors and multiple businesses across the state, are suing Gov. Larry Hogan over two executive orders implemented statewide amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  State delegates Dan Cox, Neil Parrott and Warren Miller are among those suing Gov. Hogan over his stay-at-home order and order to only enter essential businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.   According to court documents , Del. Cox was set to speak at  Saturday’s Reopen Maryland Protest  and was allegedly threatened with arrest if he attended the rally in Frederick County.   Cox said in court documents that he was warned by a senior law enforcement official that the “’Governor has his sights on you’” and that if I attend, ride along and speak at the Reopen Rally, I would potentially be arrested because certain individuals had indicated they may stop cars “and arrest you.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     He then said he spoke with the Governor’s senior advisor Andrew Cassilly and Chief Counsel Mike Pedone who confirmed that if Del. Cox attends and speaks at the Reopen Rally he may be arrested.   Cox said he was then told he would be punished in accordance with the March 17 executive order, with an arrest for violating the executive order where a violator could face up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.   Cox addressed the lawsuit in a  Facebook post , it reads:   “Today, on behalf of thousands of Marylanders represented by 18 brave Plaintiffs, I regrettably had to file suit to seek to rein in the overreaching of the Governor’s Orders. As a Delegate I have fought hard in my Judiciary Committee for the Governor’s legislative policies, I’ve co-sponsored nearly all his legislation, and I even gave a Floor speech in defense of his budgetar y authority which the Left was taking away this Session. However, the line of freedom that the Supreme Court has explained is sacred to our American values and our natural liberty, has been crossed. On behalf of 22,000 Marylanders and millions who agree in this State, it’s past time Mr. Governor to lighten the heavy hand of your Executive Orders and stop picking winners and losers, and Reopen Maryland. Marylanders will not stand for continued house arrest and lock-downs and the destruction of our businesses and way of life.     We are smart enough to protect the elderly, those in nursing homes and those with vulnerable health conditions while also ensuring that the health and freedom of ALL Maryland is protected. This is not a partisan issue, this is our shared American way of life and we will keep it, so help us God.  Thank you to my colleagues who are standing with me, including Delegates unspoken and those who joined me in this suit, Delegate Warren Miller and Delegate Neil Parrott.”     The suit names the governor, Health Secretary Bobby Neall, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col Woodrow “Jerry” Jones and Deputy Health Secretary Fran Phillips as defendants.   Del. Parrott issued the following statement in a news release about his decision file the lawsuit:   “Threatening a legislator with arrest for exercising his first amendment right to free speech is not only unconstitutional, it is wrong. We live in a Republic, and I want to make sure that no one person in Maryland or in any other state of the nation should be able to have unchecked power. ”   Gov. Hogan issued the State of Emergency on March 5 and has since signed these executive orders.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Officials Urge Marylanders To Fill Out The 2020 Census, Self-Response Deadline Extended Due To Coronavirus Pandemic
.W
The U.S. Census Bureau began sending out invitations to complete the 2020 Census in March.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  The U.S. Census Bureau began sending out invitations to complete the 2020 Census in March. While Maryland’s response rate is above the national average, officials are urging those who have not responded, to do so.  The U.S. Census helps determine the distribution of resources across the country, and officials say it’s more important now, than ever.   “The numbers that we get, the data that we get, will inform the number of vaccines we may get, the number of hospital beds that are available,” said Robert McCord, Maryland Secretary of Planning. “Public health emergency services all are informed by census data.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     At just under 60 percent, Maryland’s response rate is above the national average of 56 percent. Due to COVID-19, the self-response phase has been extended until October 31.   “This is the first time in the history of the census that there are three ways to respond,” McCord said. “You can respond by online, you can respond by phone and you can respond when the form comes.”   The Baltimore City response rate currently sits at just under 46 percent below the national average, but according to Mayor Jack Young, they’re leading many of their peer cities.   “But some are gaining on us,” Mayor Young said. “So we need to maintain our focus to goal of 73 percent household response.”   The city has launched a dashboard to help track the response rate.   “I encourage all residents to use this tool to track their community census response,” Mayor Young added.   What’s on the table in Maryland? $16 billion in funding which will be distributed depending on the census.   $100,000 in grants has been distributed to 30 different minority owned businesses, churches and grass root organizations working to educate the public about the Census.

All 20 Baltimore County senior centers now have individual Facebook pages that will let senior center members chat and stay connected with staff and other members.

TOWSON, Md. (WJZ) —  Baltimore County’s Department of Aging is setting up a “virtual senior center” to give connections and resources for Baltimore County’s older adults.  The initiative comes after Baltimore County closed physical senior centers to the public on March 16 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.   “Our senior centers fill an important role in the lives of so many of  Baltimore   County ’s older adults. During this unprecedented time, we’re doing more than ever before to expand our reach, innovate, and provide seniors with access to the critical supports they need,”  Baltimore   County  Executive Johnny Olszewski said. “We know that many older adults experience feelings of social isolation, and I want to applaud our Department of Aging for all their work to provide personal contact, online programming, and other essential resources in this uncertain period.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     All 20 Baltimore County senior centers now have individual Facebook pages that will let senior center members chat and stay connected with staff and other members.

They could take classes in Tai Chi, foreign language, strength training and cooking, or even do group happy hours.   To find the full list of Senior Center Online Classes, please visit  www. baltimore countymd.gov/aging   Since the center closures, the department has served over 8,300 meals to seniors, 33 percent more than before the COVID-19 pandemic, the department said.   They are also working to provide shelf-stable meals or grocery box deliveries with Meals on Wheels for nearly 200 senior citizens who need food urgently.   Department of Aging staff are also assisting with  Baltimore   County ’s Saturday food distribution sites at the Hereford and Reisterstown Senior Centers.   Baltimore   County  Department of Aging staff continue to work remotely, making individual phone calls and have identified other methods of contacting residents, including email, text, and postcards, to provide residents with information about important resources.

Baltimore-Based Disinfect-it Thriving During Coronavirus Pandemic As Businesses, Residents Look For Thorough Cleaning
.W
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, companies that provide disinfecting services have been busy working to clean commercial properties and private residents.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, companies that provide disinfecting services have been busy working to clean commercial properties and private residents.  Marcellis Mosby started his Baltimore-based commercial and residential disinfecting service  Disinfect-it  in February.   “I had been doing a lot of research into COVID-19, looking into everything else that’s been going on around the world,” Mosby said. “I saw that it was going to come to the states and I wanted to be proactive.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     His service uses a technology known as ULV cold fogging to atomize a disinfecting liquid, allowing it to penetrate deep into surfaces and materials and kill bacteria and viruses like COVID-19.   “Everything that we use is safe for food contact, safe for pets, plants and safe for small children as well,” he said.   That’s good news for restaurants like Ekiben in Hampden, which added the service to their already thorough cleaning regiment as an extra layer of precaution.   “We know how to keep a kitchen clean,” co-owner Ephrem Abebe said, “but going the extra mile, especially at a time like this, just making sure everything is top-notch, that helps.”   Abebe also added that it’s a piece of mind for their customers and employees, who are like family.   “We want them to stay as healthy as possible,” he said.   It’s not just restaurants that use disinfecting services — churches, daycares, gyms and private homes are too.   Mosby said his company will even go into the homes of those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus to help stop the spread.   “There’s so many different ways this virus travels. Being able to come in and stop it before it has the ability to spread to one person and then multiple people is ultimately the goal,” he said.   The cost of these services varies depending on the company. Disinfect-it starts at $200 for the first 1,000 square feet and is $50 for every 500 square feet after that. They’re certified in Maryland, Virginia, D.C. and Pennsylvania.   They also donate their services to a select number of nonprofits, churches and shelters.

Baltimore Mayoral Candidate Mary Miller Touts Public, Private Sector Experience As Primary Nears
.W
Mary Miller is one of 32 candidates vying to become Baltimore's next mayor.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  In just under a month, Baltimore voters will head to the polls for the mayoral primary election.   As the election nears, a recent poll shows there is no clear frontrunner in the race.   Thirty-two candidates — seven Republicans, 24 Democrats and one unaffiliated — are vying for the city’s top office.   WJZ is taking a closer look at the candidates hoping to become the next mayor: in this story is political newcomer Mary Miller.   Miller, a Democrat, is a first-time candidate with a platform that addresses the city’s critical needs. A recent Hart Research poll shows her, former mayor Sheila Dixon and city council president Brandon Scott all polling at 16 percent.   “It confirms some of our internal polling work, so we’re very heartened by that and it gives us a lot of confidence to keep marching forward to the primary on June 2,” Miller said in an interview.   In 2010, then-President Barack Obama appointed her the first woman under secretary of finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.   Miller said her experience in both the public and private sectors sets her apart as a candidate.   “I bring a unique mix of experience in the public sector, the private sector and public policy that I think could be very helpful to Baltimore right now, particularly as we try to recover from the coronavirus,” she said. “My time in the Obama administration following the last recession was squarely focused on economic recovery.”   COVID-19 is also highlighting the city’s needs, Miller said, listing everything from the digital divide to students’ access to education at home to telemedicine and health care access.   She has also prioritized public safety as part of her platform.   “We know there are big issues there, we know … it is hard to do but we’ve got to do that,” she said. “We’ve got to do it more urgently. I would like to bring the same sense of urgency to our crime problems that we have brought to the coronavirus.”   Ballots for the election will begin to be mailed out on Friday.

Simone Missick discusses 'All Rise's season finale and their first ever virtual episode.

All Rise  will venture into brand new territory when the show airs its first season finale and their first ever ‘digitally produced’ episode on Monday May 4th. Due to COVID-19 suspending in-person production the case and crew were able to come together to put an episode together completely through online video chat.  CBS  Local’s Matt Weiss spoke to series star Simone Missick to discuss the show’s season finale and the challenges of filming an episode over video chat.   MW:  Hi Simone, how a re you holding up with everything?     SM:  I cannot complain!   MW:  That’s good, happy to hear it.  W e’re all doing a little bit of a different interview today on zoom a nd this  we ek ‘s episode of  All Rise  is a little bit different as well being  the show’s first virtual episode .   C an you talk about what went through your mind when they told you we’re going to be doing a virtual episode ?     SM:   W hen they first  read us  their idea of the script .   A ll of us were super excited .   We  immediately thought ,  one the concept sounds very important ,  timely . T hey were able to capture what each character’s personality is and what that would go through during a time of pandemic ,  so we were all excited .   I t wasn’t until we started doing  tech  scouts and location scouts and hair and makeup meetings where they  I ‘m looking at you like are you going to be able to do this .   T hen I was like ,   ‘ oh this is way more difficult than I  thought.’ [Laughs]     I t wasn’t until we started shooting  and  I would be exhausted after like five hours of work .  I said ,   ‘ oh it’s because I’m doing 13 jobs ,  including acting .’   I t was definitely challenging .   I t was a lot of hard work .   T here were a lot of moments where we had to figure out the technology of it .   A  scene that was supposed to start at 10 AM wouldn’t start until 11 because we couldn’t get an actress camera or microphone to connect or the signal was weak .     T hrough all of it we just kept laughing .   W e just kept being appreciative of the fact that we were working .   T here are so many people who are out of work right now especially as actors .   S o ,  for us to get the fortune to be able to do a theater season finale and to do it in this way which is historical .   I t was a blessing, i t  wasn’t lost  on  us .     MW:   A lso ,  very  relatable  for the average nine to five office  worker  as well . I think we’ve all experienced an issue with video chatting. A lot of people on mute accidentally…   SM:   Yeah,  we definitely have a moment in the  episode,  and it came for real life . Ruthie Ann Miles, she  plays Sherry .   S he kept accidentally forgetting to un-mute herself and so we would be doing all this whole scene everything is perfect everyone’s signal is right then  we would  do  is  look over and see her mouth  going with  no  sound.     Everybody is like   Ruthie;  you have you have to unmute yourself .   T hey eventually wrote it into the  episode  and used  that  take where she’s like talking about that fact .  I’m sure that like you said so many people are doing video  meetings from home .   O ur family  has a video  call every day at 4 o’clock to pray together and to catch up and make sure everybody’s doing well and they have what they need .  I think we’re all becoming video chat  expert s.     MW:   W as that difficult bonding with the actors and playing off of each other doing it through the screen when you’re used to being right next to someone ?     SM:   It’s  so interesting because we’ve been working together for a year now .   T here was something very comfort ing  about having this family that we have on the other side of the screen .   T here were times when we’re doing the full court  scenes  and it’s all of the series regulars who’s been there since the beginning pilot .   I t felt like we were in the room together even though we were speaking through a cam e ra because acting is all about listening .   And  yeah,  a lot of it is about being able to touch one another and to feel the energy of the other person .   W e have just really gotten so strong over this time a nd  close as a cast and as a family .    I t felt comforting in the middle of what we’re all going through t o be able to have something that did feel normal .   W e’ve got some really amazing guest actors this episode ,  a gentleman named Moe McRae ,  who actually played my  husband,  or I played his wife on another show .   S o ,  it was nice to know somebody across the room you know the screen that I know  personally,  and his wife plays his girlfriend  on the show.   W hich is great .   T hen I have my husband on the show and obviously I know that dude .   As  strange is the aspect of the screen is it still felt like we were right there with  one another.     MW:  Y ou talked about earlier having to do makeup and lighting and all that stuff .   W as your husband your kind of defacto lighting and camera gu y ?     SM:   No,   he was  definitely my  set  mover of furniture .   W henever I needed something brought from some other part of the house he would definitely step in and help but for the most part we were all doing it on our own .   H e had to shoot one day and  I was definitely there to help him make sure that the setup was right because I’ve gotten so used to it .   For the most part,  no it was me and obviously the 30 or 50 other people who were sitting in the virtual video village saying ,   ‘ hey you know your lightning to do this and you need this computer screen closer for sound ’. W e definitely had about a third of our crew that would still working . J ust not on set .   J ust on the virtual set .   T hat was nice because we weren’t completely alone in it .     MW:  So after all that work w hat can you actually tell us about this week ’ s episode ?   W hen everyone’s  mics were un muted and when everyone was connected and had their lighting ,  what are we actually going to be seeing ?     SM:  [Laughs]  Y ou’re going to see these characters not tumbling through the technology of how does this work ,   h ow do I figure this out a s much as you see them just trying to manage doing their jobs in light of the pandemic .  I think that that’s really cool .  I mean there have been a couple different shows that have made use of this technology .   I t’s been poking fun at the technology  and  seeing skits about it .   This  is really how are these people managing this crisis .   H ow are they able to still seek justice in Los Angeles during a time of pandemic when so many people are vulnerable .     W hen the rights of people who have trials still have to be met and yet at the same  time,  we have to keep people safe .   O ur show , we  walk a fine line between humor and drama .   Y ou will definitely see that in this  episode .   P eople dealing with crisis can sometimes be funny .   W e definitely walk that fine line .   T hen at the end it’s hopeful ,  it makes you feel good .   Which is a nother aim that our show has .   W e want you to take this ride with us and get on this rollercoaster or  Lolacoaster  as  we’d like to affectionately call it .   A t the end of the day feel like  that  there is  hope  because there is .     MW:    Most  of the time it’s a thin line between comedy and tragedy balancing those two .   W hat does it mean to you to be able to provide people with that comedy and that distraction from what’s really going on in the world right now for the time that they sit down to watch  All Rise ?     SM:  I,  like most people, spend a lot of time watching show s.   B ingeing shows .   C atching up on  reality  TV that I would never have the time to watch .   W hen I watch these things it’s inevitable that I look and I go ,   ‘ oh that’s BC that’s before corona .’ You’re watching  people in restaurants and hugging each other and drinking and going to the movies and you’re like that was before Corona .  L ike ,   ‘ Oh my goodness .’     T here’s a feeling of ,  it’s a gift ,  it’s a blessing to be able to give people something where they can still take that journey and be distracted and be entertained .   For  it to feel close to what they’re going through right now .   F or it to feel present and in the moment .   F or it to not feel like a faraway moment  that they  took for granted five weeks ago versus where it is today .   H ow they can live in the moment and still be thankful and recognize that there are some good things that are coming out of this tragedy .   I t just feels great to give people something timely .     Also  being able to say goodbye to our audience for this season .   T his is our season finale .   I t wasn’t what we planned but it’s great to be able to give them a proper farewell until season two . Hopefully!   MW:   Well t hat’s all  I  have  for you today Simone. T hank you so much .   I t’s been a pleasure talking to you  I ‘m really looking forward to  the  episode  Mo nday night .     SM:   T hank you , Matt. It was great talking to you!

H ave you all done  anything “together” ?     MG:  W e did a big video call  with everybody the other day but we’re always checking in on each other .   Text and phone.   S eems like everybody’s doing OK .     CTE:  Y eah ,   I ‘ve been posing .   I like to,  from time to time ,  just kind of pose as a door dash driver just so  I  can get close to see  M ax and  Tichina .   I ‘ll just go by,  I won’t even have f ood,  I’ll just have the outfit and the hot bag where I can just put stuff in there . J ust stand outside their house and say ,  ‘ hey  guys !’   and they’ll say, ‘hey  where ’s  my chicken wings ’,   and I’m  like ,   ‘ I’m sorry  I ‘m not a real  D oor  D ash  d ude .     MW:  [Laughs] W ell maybe it’s a side job for you .   Y ou already have the uniform .       CTE:   Yeah exactly.   I don’t know why I didn’t think about actually making money with it .   B ut I  do it to go see people.      MW:  N ice ,  nice .   Y ou  two  have a great relationship .   T he relationship between Dave and Calvin didn’t start off so great but that’s grown a lot as the show is going on .   C an you talk about that relationship and how it’s grown over the seasons ?     MG:  I think it’s been a really nice partnership between both Cedric and I and the writers .   T rying to find a really smart balance of not keeping it totally contentious between the two of them .   A llowing  them  to really have moments where they come  together  and we see their friendship .   But  also ,  at the same time not letting them get too close .  I think in terms of Cedric and I  on set  and what we’ve been able to establish it’s been really special,  really organic .  I can’t speak for Cedric ,  but I very much enjoyed my time working on this show .  I think our relationship on the show is something that I’m most proud .     CTE:  Y eah same here for sure .  I think that all the intentions of what the show is about  in the   fir st place .   It’s  really start ed  to show  it self right here in this second season .   It’ s  the  idea of   kind of having prejudices and ideas  against  someone because you don’t know them .   In the second  season we start to get to know each other a little bit ,  those idiosyncras ies,   those  small things that makes a person  tick  and those things that  tick  you off .  I t’s  in that thread is where you find  its a  great bond of uniqueness  and  friendship .   T hat’s what Dave and Calvin  are  start ing   to find  throughout the season .   O f course,  a lot of funny .    T hese last two episodes are really a great example of that because  Dave  tries to do something good and  in the middle of doing  something  good ,  he tries to take it another level further  and  Calvin  is  just not with it . He  tries to run for City Council ,  with his first time out , he  expects to win .       MW:  I was go ing to  ask about tonight , where  we’ll see  an  episode where  Max, your  character runs for City Council  and  Cedric your character helps him out .   C an you talk about what we’re going to see with that a little bit more ?     MG:   Y eah .  Dave is out in front of the house and  has a  near death experience  where he’s almost  run over by a car .   H e decides to petition within the community to get a  speed bump  put in .   H e’s successful and  it ignites a  sense of civic dut y,  so he decides to run for City Council .   T he incumbent at the moment is played by Wayne Brady who is the City Councilman at the time .  Calvin sort of reluctantly helps Dave get ready for an election run .     MW:   F irst thing that popped in my head when you said Wayne Brady was the  C happelle Show  skit .  Is that the Wayne Brady we’ll be seeing as your antagonist.   CTE:   Y eah,  he does a little bit of bo th.   The  CBS version of where he’s the good guy and he’s just kind  of  a bad guy  where you see this  under tone.   He  plays  this very  cool version of what would be a politician who’s charming and loving to the people who got his back .    T hen  w he n   he finds out someone is  challenging  him;  you see this  the  evil  Wayne  Brady ,   the  Chappelle Show  Wayne Brady. We tried to capture that.   U nfortunately ,  this is supposed to be a  three-show   arc.  W e weren’t able to finish that last one that really  round  his character little more b ut we love what it was doing .       MW:  A s part of the election campaign do you dress up as  D oor  D ash guys and go to  people’s  houses and just put stuff in their mailboxes ?   I s that really where this  c ame  from?     MG:  [Laughs]  That was our finale  and we weren’t able to shoot it . That was the last episode.     MW:  Bummer. H opefully you do that next season at some point .     MG:  We hope .     MW:  L ast question for you both  be for e I  let you go .   T onight,  a  double episode and a lot of people are going through a tough time but TV and  The Neighborhood  gives people a chance to escape. What does it mean to each of you to be able to fill some of that void for people?   CTE:   W ell I think it’s really great .   I’m  really excited that in the past few weeks people just really still stay tuned into the show, w atching  each w e e k, it ‘s great .   It   let s  you know that people are at home   with their families .   We’l l provide a great family form of entertainment .   It’s  making people laugh and also growing and learning and looking at their neighbors differently .  I’m just really proud to be a part of the show, e xcited that people lov ing it.     MG:   This is something we’re  all really proud of  b efore any of this happened is that this has always been a family show .   A show  that you can gather everybody together on a Monday night or whenever you want to watch it and sit down and watch it and have a nice experience with your entire family .   W hether it’s your brother ,  your sister or your kids  or  whatever  it is,  I think that’s something we’ve always been proud of ;  especially at a time like  this.       MW:  Thank you both so much for the time today and all the best, stay safe!

Coronavirus Latest: Lawmakers Plan To Seek More Federal Funding For Baltimore, Other Cities Struggling Financially From COVID-19
.W
Maryland lawmakers promised help for Baltimore and other cities bleeding money since the coronavirus pandemic began.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland lawmakers promised help for Baltimore and other cities bleeding money since the coronavirus pandemic began.  “These are tough, dark and difficult times,” said Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who is set to be sworn in on Tuesday. “This revenue loss is so astronomical that it will take a long, long time to get back to normal.”   The U.S. Senate is going back in session, and Senator Ben Cardin said a priority of Maryland’s federal delegation is getting funding for local governments.   “The federal government must step up. The health and welfare of the people of our state are directly involved in this,” Cardin said.   Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger blasted President Trump’s handling of the pandemic, saying it appeared the president’s strategy was cobbled together.   “If we continue to move forward without getting any money to local government, it’s going to affect the basics,” he said. “We have a president that his strategy was, ‘I’m going to be the king. I’m going to take over.’ Well, I’ve seen no comprehensive strategy there, and if that’s not going to be there, we’re going to jump in with governors and do whatever we can to get the resources to do the job.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young noted the city is “resilient” but cautioned against opening Maryland too quickly.   “We want to make sure to do it in the right way — that we follow exactly what our health care professionals are telling us to do. We will be open when they say we shall be open,” Young said Monday.

Reopen Maryland held another protest over the weekend demanding Governor Larry Hogan relax some of his orders, nicknaming him “Lockdown Larry.”   A coalition of some business owners and pastors along with four state delegates  filed a federal lawsuit  against Hogan claiming his stay-at-home order is unconstitutional.

On Monday, Virginia’s governor said the first phase of his state’s recovery may begin  as early as May 15 .   As of now, there has been no such announcement from Governor Hogan, but state lawmakers were presented with a possible scenario last week that the first phase of Maryland’s recovery could begin by May 15. Phase two would start September 3 and last the remainder of 2020.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

‘It’s A Wake-Up Call’ | City Sanitation Worker Contracts Coronavirus Even After Taking Every Precaution
.W
Dozens of Baltimore city employees are off the streets fighting COVID-19.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Dozens of Baltimore city employees are off the streets fighting COVID-19.  One DPW employee spoke to WJZ’s Paul Gessler about his symptoms and his message to the public. WJZ had interviewed sanitation worker Maurice Harried just one week before he tested positive.   He told us he doesn’t know how he contracted coronavirus.   Almost three weeks ago, Harried was on his trash route in south Baltimore when WJZ interviewed him.   Sanitation Workers Considered Essential And Busy With Rise In Residential Trash   “Hoping we go home healthy, you know, don’t carry anything home to our families,” he told WJZ at the time.   Harried spoke with us from his couch Monday as he recovered from COVID-19.   “I thank God for my health. I’m glad I didn’t bring anything home to my wife and my kid,” he said.   Maurice started feeling symptoms a couple of days after our interview. He tested positive a week later with chills, body aches and a feeling he’d been hit in the ribs.   “Along with my chest and it was like something I’d never experienced before, and I went on with that for like 10 days,” Harried said.   The two other guys on his crew quarantined, and so did the WJZ crew as soon as his family member said something.   Even with masks on, they were briefly within six feet to place a GoPro and microphone. Harried said he took all the precautions.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “What we do on a daily basis, wearing gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, and things like that,” Harried said.   He’s among several Baltimore city employees with the virus. As of Monday afternoon, city officials say 35 members of the police department tested positive; of them, 25 have returned to work.   All 14 city firefighters who tested positive are now back. Harried said he hopes others will listen to warnings to stay home and distance.     Additionally, Baltimore’s Joint Information Center manager reports about a third of city employees are teleworking.  pic.twitter.com/dQZ49zI7sY   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  May 4, 2020     “Stay your distance. Wear your mask,” he said. ” When it hit me, it hit home and it let me know it’s a wake-up call. If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone.”   Overall, Maurice’s case was fairly mild.   He said he’s just about back to 100 percent and a doctor has cleared him to return to work. Harried thinks he’ll wait it out a few more days.

‘Wine Fairy’ Becomes Internet Sensation In Maryland

If you find a care package on your step, you are expected to craft one together for another neighbor.

HARFORD COUNTY, Md. (WJZ) —  It’s not always fun to be ding dong ditched, but when you open your door and find a bottle of wine left behind, it suddenly becomes an Internet sensation.   The “wine fairy” has made stops in Cecil County, Harford County and Essex to name a few. It started as a way to help neighbors during quarantine around Maryland.   The technical term WJZ is hearing for this phenomenon is “fairies,” or at least that’s what residents are calling them, and they are making their way into Maryland to bring some smiles and cheer.   The “Sisterhood of the Traveling Wine” Facebook group shared videos and photos of people dressing up as fairies and leaving wine and sometimes beer on doorsteps, and WJZ got some photos as well!     wine Credit: Olivia Torrence IMG_3361 Credit: Katie Kress 20200503_163258 Credit: Donna Keavney wine2 Credit: Brenda Knight thumbnail_image1 Credit: The Rickard Family IMG_6995 Credit: Krysta Gray           The idea then expanded into gift baskets, all in an effort to spread some cheer during a difficult time and pay it forward. It became less about the alcohol and more about bringing a little cheer!   If you find a care package on your step, you are expected to craft one together for another neighbor.

Parents Petition Against ‘Disappointing’ Decision To Hold Virtual Graduation Amid Coronavirus Outbreak

Parents in the Des Moines, Iowa, public school district are circulating a petition to overturn the school board's decision to hold graduation ceremonies online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

DES MOINES, Iowa (CBS Local)  — Parents in the Des Moines, Iowa, public school district are circulating a petition to overturn the school board’s decision to hold graduation ceremonies online due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The petition asks the school board to postpone virtual graduation ceremonies so they can be held as traditional, in-person events.   “It was just really disappointing to us when Des Moines came through with their decision to just, you know, do away with any sort of physical recognition for the kids and the hard work they’ve put into it,” Jessica Gathercole, the mother of an  East High School  senior, told  CBS affiliate KCCI .   The  petition  on Change.org suggests that ceremonies could be held under strict rules.     DSM parents petition against virtual graduation during COVID-19 outbreak  https://t.co/JaVattSKfR   — KCCI News (@KCCINews)  May 4, 2020     “We could have there be a limit of attendance, such as only parents and/or guardians,” the petition page reads. “Also can go on a schedule alphabetically and certain times. To minimize risk and ease minds. Each high school could hold it at their football field.”   The petition, titled “DMPS Class of 2020 Graduation Ceremony,” had more than 1,500 signatures as of noon Tuesday.   The school district said it formed a working group with representation from each high school to consider an outdoor ceremony but determined that a virtual graduation would be the safest during the COVID-19 pandemic.   “We looked at doing something outside, perhaps one of our football fields or another outdoor venue, but at the end of the day we kept coming back to the likelihood that at best this was going to be a 50/50 proposition that such an event could be held,” said Phil Roeder, with Des Moines Public Schools.   The virtual graduation ceremonies are  scheduled to begin  Saturday, June 27.

Survey: Millennials ‘Pushing Off Major Life Milestones’ During Coronavirus Pandemic

Millennials are "pushing off major life milestones" such as marriage, having a child or buying a house due to the cornavirus pandemic, says a new report.

(CBS Local)  — Millennials are “pushing off major life milestones” such as marriage, having a child or buying a house due to the cornavirus pandemic, says a new report.  While the coronavirus pandemic is affecting most Americans in a major way, millennials are reporting the biggest impact on their finances, according to a  survey  published Wednesday by personal finance software company  Quicken .   25 percent of millennials said their finances had been significantly impacted negatively by the virus, which was the highest percent by generation.   33 percent of millennials reported that they lost their job or had their hours at work reduced due to COVID-19, while 38 percent said another member of their household had as well.     To better understand the impact of the  #pandemic  on Americans' personal finances, we conducted a  #survey  earlier this month of more than 1,300 adults in the U.S.  #Quicken   #coronavirus   #personalfinances   https://t.co/t7H8mS2nDk   pic.twitter.com/A7jRm1AMZh   — Quicken (@Quicken)  May 1, 2020     Millennials are also delaying major life milestones more than other generations because of COVID-19, including:     8 percent of millennials postponed their wedding   23 percent of millennials are putting off buying a house anytime soon   13 percent of millennials are putting off having a child     “The millennial generation struggled ahead of the pandemic to save for retirement,” the report said, “and far fewer owned a home than generations before them. The current economic conditions are likely to only exacerbate those trends.”   Overall, a total of 62 percent of respondents said the coronavirus has had a negative impact on their finances.   “The financial repercussions of the coronavirus crisis can’t be overstated,”  said  Eric Dunn, CEO of Quicken. “Just 4% of survey respondents said there would be no impact for them, highlighting the widespread financial challenges facing Americans today. We’re already seeing this impact causing changes in behavior, with half of respondents noting that they are making an effort to spend less and save more.”

Coronavirus Update: If Your Maryland Unemployment Claim Became Inactive This Week, Here’s What You Need To Know

New federal guidelines requiring states to capture more information about unemployment insurance claimants has created another obstacle in what some say is an already frustrating process to file for unemployment insurance in Maryland.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  New federal guidelines requiring states to capture more information about unemployment insurance claimants has created another obstacle in what some say is an already frustrating process to file for unemployment insurance in Maryland.  The new guideline has created confusion for claimants as they complete their weekly claim on the BEACON One-Stop portal, according to the state’s Department of Labor.   “Federal guidance has required states to capture additional information from claimants as they complete their weekly claim certification,” state labor secretary Tiffany P. Robinson said in a statement. “Marylanders found these new required questions to be confusing, resulting in numerous claimants inactivating their eligibility for unemployment benefits.”   The question causing the most confusion asked people if they received unemployment compensation under any state, from the federal government or from Canada, a department spokesperson said. It has since been changed to clarify that it’s asking about any other state excluding Maryland.   In response to feedback, Robinson said her department implemented and automatic solution to reactivate these claims and prevent benefits from being interrupted.

Those with a claim that became inactive this Sunday or Monday after filing their weekly claim certification will also have their claim automatically reactivated but do not need to refile this week’s claim certification.   “As issues arise, we are working as quickly as we can to resolve them. Nothing is more important to us than ensuring that all eligible Marylanders receive the benefits they need and deserve as soon as possible,” Robinson said in a statement.

University Of Maryland School Of Medicine Begins Coronavirus Vaccine Trial
.W
The research will study the safety, efficacy, and dosing of an experimental mRNA -based vaccine.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (WJZ)–  Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have begun testing experimental COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.  The research, funded by Pfizer Inc., will study the safety, efficacy, and dosing of an experimental mRNA-based vaccine.   The vaccine research is being conducted in the UMSOM Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, and it is part of a multicenter study in the U.S. and in Germany that will include up to 360 participants in this initial stage.   “We are all here working very long days,” said Dr. Kirsten Lyke, a professor with the University of Maryland School of Medicine.   Researchers said the trial will trick the body into thinking it has COVID-19 without any actual symptoms. They’ll then wait to see how the four vaccines being tested will respond.   “Our goal is to have a viable vaccine candidate that can go into mass production by the autumn,” Lyke said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In Baltimore, the clinical trial includes up to 90 healthy adult participants between 18 and 85 years of age.   One of the participants is UMSOM graduate student David Rach.   “As soon as I heard about it, it was something I was interested in doing,” he said.   Like many people, Rach said he knows others, including members of his family, who are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.   He hopes his participation will help bring about a cure.   “My hope at the end of this is that we get a vaccine quickly,” he said.

Members from the 58th and 629th expeditionary military intelligence brigades said goodbye to their loved ones Tuesday morning.

LINTHICUM, Md. (WJZ) —  Soldiers from Maryland’s National Guard are now on deployment in the Middle East.  Around 130 members of the 58th and 629th expeditionary military intelligence brigades said goodbye to their loved ones Tuesday morning. This is the first time the team is being deployed.   They are the first group of soldiers from the unit to deploy in support of combat operations to fight the global War on Terror.   Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan visited Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport Tuesday to send them off.   “(I’m) really sorry I can’t shake all your hands but I’ll give you one of these and tell you good luck. I know you’re going to perform admirably as you always do,” Hogan said.   Due to the pandemic, the send-off looked a bit different than normal.   “Because of COVID-19 and social distancing considerations, we’re doing a rolling farewell,” one person said.

I t’s a great episode .   My  character Jess had a tough relationship with his own father .   H e draws on that knowledge ,  and that understanding ,  and that relationship to be able to communicate with this father-son criminal team .   A nother interesting part of it for Jess  is this is the first time we get to see  him humanized and struggling with raising his daughter after   he lost his wife a couple of years ago in Afghanistan.  T his is first time we get to see it .     Then we also  see  his brother in law  on e of  the five team members, h e  encourages him to contemplate meeting other people .  To be a bit more  social.  He’s the least  social guy  you’d meet, he  just wouldn’t  do  that kind of stuff .   He  tries to encourage him to come out of his shell a little bit ,  I guess is a nice way to describe it .     W e have a couple of  scenes  where he  meets  a couple of  people. He meets a girl at a bar, he meets somebody else. It’s in the confines of how we do the show. We’re not going to have a party. It’s a very simple and beautiful moment. Jess gets the courage to talk to somebody outside of the FBI, it’s quite sweet.     MW:  Well I’m a  big fan of the sh ow and I’m  really  looking  forward to seeing that .  Thank you for the time today Julian and stay safe, good luck to your daughter on finals!   JM:  Yeah you too mate and you take care  and good luck with everything!

Ocean City Mayor Says Town Will Not Enforce Local-Only Mandate, Require Masks As Beach Reopens Saturday
.W
Ocean City, Maryland Mayor Rick Meehan said when the beach and boardwalk opens this Saturday, police will not be enforcing the town's local-only mandate.

OCEAN CITY, Md. (WJZ) —  Ocean City, Maryland Mayor Rick Meehan said when the beach and boardwalk opens this Saturday, police will not be enforcing the town’s local-only mandate.  Meehan also said beach visitors will also not be required to wear a mask. He said people visiting the beach should, however, follow social distancing and limit groups to 10 people or fewer. Police will be patrolling the beach and boardwalk to remind people to social distance, should they see crowds gathering.   Ocean City closed its beaches in March following the governor’s stay at home order to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.   Ocean City, Maryland Beaches, Boardwalk Reopening For Locals On May 9   The beach town mayor held a press conference Tuesday morning after news broke late Monday about the beaches reopening May 9  after town officials previously said they would reopen on May 15. The mayor  made the declaration  during the council meeting and said it would be a way for locals to get fresh air and exercise.   “I wanted to take this opportunity to provide some information on the decision to issue the declaration opening the town of Ocean City’s beach, boardwalk, and inlet parking lot effective Saturday, May 9,” Meehan said. “I want to make it clear that this does not supersede any executive orders made by Governor [Larry] Hogan to stay at home. The governor’s [order] is still in effect this does not supersede that. At this time you should only travel to Ocean City if doing so would not be in violation of the governor’s specific stay at home.”   But on Tuesday, Meehan said he knows he cannot stop other Marylanders or others from coming into Ocean City. He just hopes people are responsible.   “The declaration open Ocean City’s beach and boardwalk and then the parking lot on Saturday, May 9 is simply to give away for individuals have more opportunities to go outside, enjoy the fresh air, while still adhering to all social distancing guidelines and gathering limits,” Meehan said. “None of that has changed, nonessential businesses along the boardwalk will continue to be closed until that order was lifted by the governor. The only thing that will really be open on the boardwalk will be some of the carryout restaurants.”     The declaration from the mayor  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/QY9O4NOSsj   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  May 5, 2020     On those who live elsewhere and have Ocean City vacation homes, Meehan said second homeowners have a right to be in their property.   However, things will not be the same for those who do visit. Hotels and short-term rentals will still only be available to essential workers and restaurants will only offer carryout.   The mayor believes opening Saturday will allow for the town to transition from its off-season to on-season crowds.   “Right now there are not very many people in Ocean City, and even with this we do not anticipate a lot of people in Ocean City, but there will be some additional visitors. This will allow for people coming over to Ocean City and this will allow us to make that transition,” he said. “You know phased recovery is what we are trying to abide to. We support the governor’s recovering program we’re trying to work cohesively with that. I think the governor has put us in a position by issuing all his orders early on that we’re able now to take this next step here in Ocean City, what we see and what I see as what I go up to the boardwalk is that people are adhering to the new normal.”   Meehan doesn’t believe crowds will flock to Ocean City this weekend.   “I don’t really think that’s what’s gonna happen,” Meehan said. “You know we’re only at the first weekend in May, and typically even in this time of year in our crowds are much smaller than they’re going to be as you get into the end of the month or into June and particularly into July.”   Lodging restrictions that Ocean City issued for hotels and short term rentals are still in effect and those have extended those restrictions through May 22. He said people visiting won’t have a place to stay with hotels and condos closed in the area.   Lifeguards will also not be on duty until Memorial Day as in previous years.   “There will be no police officers patrolling for license plates. I don’t believe that’s done has been done throughout the state of Maryland, anywhere, and that’s not going to be the case here in Ocean City,” the mayor said. “We do expect people to come from the surrounding areas.”   When pressed again about requirements to wear masks, Meehan said he encourages people to wear a mask if they feel safer.   “There’s no requirement in the state to wear masks in public at this time,” he said. “We certainly want to encourage people if they would feel more comfortable. That’s a personal decision.”   He said the town will be posting signs about social distancing at the entrances of the beach and boardwalk.   “The police presence and being able to converse with people, to give them instructions or at least to bring to their attention when they may not be properly distance, we’re going to continue to do those things. You know voluntary compliance is what we’ve all been looking for,” Meehan said. “I think we’ve seen a great deal of that this won’t succeed nationwide without voluntary compliance. You can’t patrol everywhere. You can’t be everywhere and as I said before that I think a great majority of the people are adhering to these regulations, and I think they will continue to do so.”   When asked if he believes opening the beach Saturday is a violation of the governor’s orders, Meehan said, “I don’t think it’s in violation of any of the general orders enacted by the governor, because we are not encouraging we are not asking anyone to supersede the travel restrictions that are in place.”   Hogan’s office did not push back on the move.“This is a way to give nearby residents more opportunities to get outside and enjoy fresh air while still adhering to social distancing guidelines and gathering limits. The governor’s stay-at-home order remains in effect,” communications managers for Hogan and the Town of Ocean City said in a joint statement late Monday night.   Ocean City is the first beach in the Mid-Atlantic region to reopen. Rehoboth Beach in nearby Delaware had to  remove public benches to enforce their beach and boardwalk  closures through May 15.  Bethany Beach in Delaware  will remain closed until June 1.   However, in New Jersey,  Stone Harbor and Avalon beaches  will reopen Friday.   “The goal of Ocean City has always been for everybody to arrive here safely, be safe while they’re here and return home safely. That has not changed and will not change. So we are moving forward. We believe this phase opening is the right thing to do,” he added.   Statewide, while Maryland’s hospitalization numbers have remained stable, on Tuesday, the state tied its daily record for deaths at 74.     27,117 confirmed  #coronavirus  cases in Maryland for Tuesday, May 5th 709 new cases in 24 hours 112,986 negative tests 1,290 deaths 1,810 recovered   @wjz   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  May 5, 2020     There are so many bodies, an ice rink in Laurel has been turned into a temporary morgue.

All Cashless Tolling On Chesapeake Bay Bridge Starting May 12
.W
It'll be easier and faster to get to the beach this summer as the all-cashless E-ZPass tolling system will launch on May 12 on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  It’ll be easier and faster to get to the beach this summer as the all-cashless E-ZPass tolling system will launch on May 12 on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The Maryland Transportation Authority made the announcement Tuesday morning saying the system was installed ahead of schedule, fulfilling Gov. Larry Hogan’s promise to be all cashless on the Bay Bridge by summer 2020.   Drivers won’t have to stop when going through the tolls. Those with E-ZPass will pay as little as $1.40 daily to cross the bridge.   Even though full-time all-electronic tolling will begin May 12 at the Bay Bridge, the MDTA will extend the time drivers without E-ZPass will be charged the cash rate of $4, giving customers more time to sign up and get an E-ZPass® through the mail. Effective 30 days after Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted, bridge drivers without E-ZPass® will be charged the Video Toll rate of $6.   The system includes three highway-speed traffic lanes that will tie into the two existing lanes on the eastbound bridge and the one westbound contraflow (two-way) lane.   “As we convert Maryland toll facilities to all-electronic tolling, now is the time for cash customers to sign-up for E-ZPass® Maryland,” said MDTA Executive Director James F. Ports, Jr. “Thanks to previous money-saving initiatives by Governor Hogan, E-ZPass® Maryland customers pay no monthly fee and receive a free transponder.”   MDTA encourages motorists to get an E-ZPass Maryland at  ezpassmd.com.

Coronavirus Latest: Del. Nick Mosby Asking Maryland Officials For More Racial, ZIP Code Data
.W
Del. Nick Mosby sent a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan Tuesday asking him to release additional coronavirus-related data around race and zip codes.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Del. Nick Mosby sent a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan Tuesday asking him to release additional coronavirus-related data around race and zip codes.  Specifically, Mosby wants the number of positive and negative tests, hospitalizations and deaths by race and ZIP code.   In early April, Hogan directed the state’s health department to publish information on racial and ethnic breakdowns of COVID-19 cases, but Mosby wants to go further.   Doing so, he said, would make sure the state’s response to COVID-19 is targeted and effective.   “It ensures that whatever plans that we’re developing especially when you have a scarcity of resources and personnel, that you are effectively and equitably using those resources and personnel,” Mosby said.   In a news release, he added that Baltimore fits the pattern of other urban areas when it comes to the virus:   “We cannot fully examine the disproportionalities already presented to us if we do not have the complete picture of the data. We need this real-time to data to ensure we have the resources to go after the areas of concern and to fully understand the totality of this virus. The data provides us with the information we need to micro-target these areas from an engagement, testing, and from a treatment perspective.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Sherita Golden, the chief diversity officer at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that in hard-hit New York City, the death rate in African American and Hispanic communities is nearly twice as high as it is in white and Asian American communities.   It’s important to collaborate with state agencies to get high-quality self-identified data, she said.   “So race, ethnicity and gender should also be stratified by language, people with limited English proficiency are going to have particular challenges navigating the healthcare system,” Golden said.   Mosby also wants Hogan to implement a Racial Health Disparities Task Force to assist with review the racial disparity data and plan for a second wave of the virus, saying other governors have implemented similar task forces.   “The fact that we were administering a program in the height of this crisis without factoring in looking at zip code data and looking at race and ethnicity data, right there presents a problem,” Mosby said.   Mosby’s proposal calls for the task force to be made up of public health officials, medical professionals, non-profit organizations and community groups.   In a statement, Hogan’s office said, “We appreciate all of the letters we have received from Delegate Mosby, and his leadership on this issue.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

A bit cooler today than yesterday’s 74°, by a bunch. Just 58° later on. The cool spell we began discussing yesterday kicks off today.

Hi Everyone!   A bit cooler today than yesterday’s 74°, by a bunch. Just 58° later on. The cool spell we began discussing yesterday kicks off today.   #spilledmilk, as in don’t cry over it. Let’s move beyond. It is a big weekend coming up, Mother’s Day weekend. Granted we will be doing the COVID-19 self chill out, but it is still a time celebrate the ladies who gave life to us, and the ladies who made us guys Dads.   And the weather, while cooler than the low 70’s normal,  will be sunny. A little “natural Vitamin D” treat from your Mom Nature.

Oysters Aren’t Very ‘Take-Out Friendly’, Oyster Farmer Says, Causing The Industry To Take Huge Hit During COVID-19 Pandemic
.W
Manager and oyster farmer Ethan Davis said it wouldn’t be uncommon to sell between 15,000 and 30,000 oysters a week, but with COVID-19, the demand simply isn’t there.

RIDGE, Md. (WJZ) —  With many restaurants remaining closed, or only offering takeout, the oyster industry has taken a huge hit.   At the True Chesapeake Oyster Farm in southern Maryland, business isn’t just down: it’s almost nonexistent.   Manager and oyster farmer Ethan Davis said it wouldn’t be uncommon to sell between 15,000 and 30,000 oysters a week, but with COVID-19, the demand simply isn’t there.   “People enjoy (oysters) when they are raw, and sitting at a table with a nice glass of beer, and yeah it’s not very takeout-friendly,” said Davis.   The good news is oysters can stay in the water until they’re once again in demand, but the bad news is they keep growing.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Davis said their ideal oysters range from two and a half to four inches, and they can usually keep them that size for three to four months.   “Once they stay in the water any longer than that they end up getting a little bigger than 4 inches and that can definitely affect how many we sell,” Davis said.   It’s not that they’re bad, they’re just big and usually require restaurants to get creative in the way they prepare them.   Large oysters are good for frying, baking, grilling or even in soup.   Davis said even though they’re not selling, the oysters still need to be cared for, on top of that it’s growing season.   This time of year can keep five employees busy for eight to nine hours a day, but due to the lack of sales, most of True Chesapeake Oyster Farm employees have been furloughed.   “We need to pick the oysters up, run them, sort them, clean them and then deploy them,” Davis said, “It normally takes three guys on the boat, and two guys on the pier and now it’s just me.”   It’s hard work, all to ensure this Maryland delicacy is on the menu when business is back to normal.   If you’re in the mood for oysters now,  you can pre-order them, and pick them up in Baltimore.

Coronavirus Latest: Baltimore City Gives $3 Million To City Schools To Close Digital Gap

Baltimore Mayor Jack Young transferred $3 million from the city's funds to city schools to help close the digital learning gap for the students.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore Mayor Jack Young transferred $3 million from the city’s funds to city schools to help close the digital learning gap for the students.  This comes as city schools have remained closed since March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.   “As long as I’ve been in public service um I truly believe that’s what this job is all about serving the public. I’ve always had two guiding principles of constituent service, and an unwavering commitment to children,” Young said.

The schools used their own budget to purchase 11,000 Chromebooks to help students access virtual learning, but there was still a gap.   “With that, we still fell far short of where our target is, which is making sure that all families and all students have access,” said City Schools CEO Dr. Sonja Santelises. “So, with that context, the mayor’s announcement today is a welcome addition, a welcome boost. I want to thank the leadership of Mayor Young, of our city council president, of our city council really stepping forward and providing this additional money.”   The money will help the schools purchase 3,500 more Chromebooks and also provide families with devices who have challenges accessing broadband internet.   “This is not a minor investment, and it is one that I am pleased and thrilled, on behalf of all of Baltimore City students, their families, our teachers to say thank you so much for Baltimore City leadership for really stepping up,” Santelises added.   “This is about a city that faced a profound crisis that came together and put the needs of children,” said Councilman Zeke Cohen. “Above politics, and I think it shows a lot of maturity and leadership on the part of the mayor, the President, the council, all of us working together, that we were able to get this done, and make what is truly a historic commitment to closing the digital divide.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Despite Coronavirus-Related Losses, Proposed Baltimore City Budget Does Not Include Tax Increase, Does Include Hiring, Salary Freezes For Employees
.W
Baltimore Mayor Jack Young is releasing a revised fiscal year budget proposal for the city which reflects coronavirus-related costs and losses.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Baltimore Mayor Jack Young is releasing a revised fiscal year budget proposal for the city which reflects coronavirus-related costs and losses.  The proposed budget for fiscal year 2021, was completely rewritten in early April as the city’s finances took a turn following the COVID-19 pandemic.   In March, Mayor Young proposed a hiring freeze for any nonessential workers. and mandated a freeze on spending. Those will remain into fiscal year 2021.   “This was an incredibly difficult budget process,” Young said. “Every City and county in the country are facing difficult budgetary decisions, and Baltimore is no different. What sets us apart, however, is the fact that even in the face of financial pressures, our commitment to our children and families is rock solid. The budget I presented makes very clear that Baltimore values its children, older adults, and most vulnerable residents. Even with the economic downturn, I believe that this is a smart and realistic budget.”   The mayor’s new budget protects core city services and functions but invests heavily in five key priority areas.   Young proposes a total city budget of $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2021, which starts July 1. This includes $3 billion of operating expenses and $832 million of capital investments.   Due to coronavirus, the city estimates a trimming of $103.1 million to account for revenue losses.   City services like police patrol, emergency response services, trash collection and recycling, and direct health services are maintained in the new budget. There are also no new taxes or increased fees and the city’s property tax rate remains flat.   The mayor has gone to the city police and firefighter unions to propose several scenarios, some of which include layoffs. But, Young said it’s the last thing he wants to do.   Those options are a salary freeze and possible furloughs, in lieu of layoffs.   City officials say they are still awaiting a response from the unions.   A breakdown of key Investments:   Children and Families:  The Mayor’s budget includes record investments in public education. The Mayor’s budget includes funding to pay for historic school construction as part of the State’s Build to Learn School Construction Program. In addition to the more than $400 million invested in direct payment to the Baltimore City Public School System, the Mayor’s budget also includes nearly $100 million of additional spending on youth-related programs, like laptops for students to do distance learning, YouthWorks summer jobs, and other initiatives.   Public Safety:  The Mayor’s budget includes $1.4 million to pay for two new Baltimore Community Intelligence Centers. The centers are modeled after a successful crime-fighting strategy that showed successful results in Chicago. The Mayor’s budget also invests heavily in patrol and community-oriented policing.   A Clean and Healthy City:  The Mayor’s budget includes investments in the City’s capital infrastructure, like water, wastewater, and stormwater funds. The budget includes a total of $608 million of new capital investments, like improvements to treatment facilities, pumping stations, stream restorations, and drainage upgrades.   Equitable Neighborhood Development:  The Mayor’s budget invests $42.1 million to grow the Housing Department’s community development framework, which includes services like demolition, homeownership incentives, and affordable housing. The Mayor recognized that cultural institutions and attractions represent an important part of a City’s vibrancy and health. To that end, Mayor Young’s budget maintains funding for arts institutions and cultural attractions that have been hit hard by closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Innovative Government:  In the face of a challenging budgetary outlook, Mayor Young decided it critically important to also invest in innovative solutions to the tough challenges that cities like Baltimore face. The Mayor’s budget includes $10 million for a variety of IT infrastructure projects that includes an upgraded data warehouse, new cable and wiring, and investments in new cyber-security tools.

COVID-19 Pandemic Poses Challenges For Those In Recovery Trying To Stay Sober

Research shows more than 20 million Americans are battling a substance abuse problem, and for those in recovery right now, the novel coronavirus has presented new challenges to stay sober.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Research shows more than 20 million Americans are battling a substance abuse problem, and for those in recovery right now, the novel coronavirus has presented new challenges to stay sober.  20-year-old Ezra Baden from Rossford, Ohio is in recovery and has been sober for a little over a month now.   “It’s important to stay active in early recovery, even in later recovery, boredom is a very strong trigger. It will take you to dark places,” Baden said.   For those in recovery, isolation may be last thing they want to be faced with. Add general anxiety surrounding a virus into the mix, and addiction avoidance becomes even more difficult.   “A lot of mental health issues are spiking up, being home with families all of the time can be stressful, there’s a lot of financial trouble right now, people are losing their jobs,” Michael Silberman, COO of Amatus Recovery Centers, said.   At Amatus Recovery Centers, many services are now offered through Telehealth instead, but their doors remain open for new clients.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We’ve actually seen an 18 percent increase of admissions,” Silberman said.   Counselors and clinicians are working around the clock to make sure those struggling with addiction stay on the right path to recovery.   Those in recovery said it’s so important right now to not let social distancing create isolation.   “I hope to God this coronavirus is taken care of soon, but my addiction is something that I cannot put on the side,” Baden said. “I’ll have to be focused on it for the rest of my life.”   Amatus Recovery said it is in the works to open a new 24 bed detox facility in Baltimore County within the next six months.

Olaniyan has been a correctional officer for nine years in Jessup.   “When you’re responding to a situation, you’re not going to be distancing yourself from that situation,” Olaniyan said. “So we’re all going to be responding to make sure we bring that situation to normalcy.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Right now, there are 57 positive cases of coronavirus throughout Maryland’s correctional system — including but not limited to — 22 correctional officers and 10 inmates.

Future distributions from this emergency fund must be allocated in a transparent manner, ensuring that all of Maryland’s hospitals have the resources they need, including those in emerging hotspots such as the Baltimore-Washington Corridor, and should recognize the essential role of other health care providers who treat vulnerable and low-income populations.”   Roughly $400 million will be allocated to hospitals and $342 million to outpatient health care providers.

Lawsuit Accuses Bank Of America Of Prioritizing Existing Customers When Doling Out Federal Coronavirus Relief Funds
.W
A federal court in Maryland heard a class-action lawsuit Friday on how banks administer federal small business loans.

BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  A federal court in Maryland heard a class-action lawsuit Friday on how banks administer federal small business loans.   Judge Stephanie Gallagher says she will issue a ruling on the temporary restraining order argued in court “as soon as possible.”   The lawsuit brought against Bank of America accuses the company of prioritizing its existing customers when doling out federal funds as part of the Paycheck Protection Program, essentially a forgivable loan program created by the $2 trillion CARES Act, also known as the coronavirus stimulus law.   The program makes nearly $350 billion available in the form of government-backed loans meant for small businesses to cover eight weeks’ worth of payroll and other expenses.   In its 16-page lawsuit filed earlier this month in Maryland, Baltimore-based marketing firm Profiles PR said Bank of America’s implementation of the law was discriminatory:   “Defendants implemented a loan process that unlawfully prioritized their existing borrowing clients and barred their depository clients and other small businesses from even applying for funds from the governmental loan programs. Nothing in the CARES Act authorizes or permits Defendants to pick and choose who would gain access to or benefit from the federally backed lending program. And, the priority of access to these limited funds is material – the demand is overwhelming as America responds to the economic tsunami of COVID-19 upon small businesses. There is no justification for requiring depository clients and other small businesses to go to the end of the line.   “Unfortunately, the banks were the ones who were supposed to administer it, but it wasn’t their money. It’s Treasury money. It’s your money. It’s taxpayer money,” said Alan Rifkin with Rifkin Weiner Livingston, LLC, an attorney representing the plaintiffs.   Yasmine Young, the owner of Diaspora Salon in Baltimore’s Charles Village neighborhood, is also participating in the class-action suit.   “I was hurt. I was upset, and then I was mad,” she said.   Young has been in business with the bank since before she opened the salon, but since she didn’t have a loan, she wasn’t able to get the PPP money.   “(Bank of America has) the ability to be a beacon of hope for people like me and you are choosing to not do that,” she said.   Bank of America said many other lenders chose not to participate in the program at all. In a brief filed Thursday, the company argues, “…beyond setting minimum eligibility criteria, the Act nowhere prohibits participating lenders from determining how best to prioritize to whom they will lend under the Program.”   The company also said prioritizing its existing customers will speed up the process and get money to businesses quicker.     Bank of America says many lenders have chosen not to participate in the PPP loan program and attorneys just cited its 3,000 employees working to process applications.   They argue the bank is prioritizing clients who have borrowing relationships to speed the process up.   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  April 10, 2020     In response, Young said, “it feels gross.”   “I’m almost disgusted by it because Bank of America says they care about small businesses.”   Several senators, including Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) have criticized Bank of America and asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to lift the restrictions.     The requirement that a  #SmallBusiness  not just have a business account but also a loan or credit card is NOT in the law we wrote & passed or in the regulations.   This is a  @BankofAmerica  requirement not a govt one.    They should drop it. This money is 100% guaranteed by fed govt.  pic.twitter.com/cG2i9eqi7k   — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)  April 3, 2020     Cardin called the bank’s priority “an artificial barrier” and “redlining by another name.”   “We’re going to support their applications being received, processed and fully funded, and we will put as much money as needed to make sure that every small business can participate that’s eligible,” he said.     The demand for  #PaycheckProtectionProgram  loans is a welcome sign that small businesses are beginning to receive the economic relief that they desperately need. I remain committed to ensuring that no small business is left behind as our cities and states address  #COVID19 .   — Senator Ben Cardin (@SenatorCardin)  April 8, 2020     Since the lawsuit was filed last week, attorneys said they’ve received 61,000 requests to join the suit.

Life in the age of the coronavirus is creating a new normal for everyone, and it's no different for those who work on the front lines.

FREDERICK, Md. (WJZ) —  Life in the age of the coronavirus is creating a new normal for everyone, and it’s no different for those who work on the front lines.  It’s a heartbreaking reality health care workers face every day.   “It’s terrifying, you try to put a poker face on so you’re not upsetting or making your patient feel like your scared,” Linda Chaffman, an ER Nurse at Frederick Health Hospital, said.   Chaffman said as a nurse in the emergency room, the stress is high.   “You’re constantly thinking did you, are you, covered completely? Did you put all your materials on right? Is there anything that you possibly did wrong that could’ve… you’re potentially bringing out of the room to another patient,” she said.   She and her coworkers are dressed head to toe in full protective gear, steps that are necessary to fend off a virus proven to be deadly.   But supplies are tight, masks are often reused, and there’s a nationwide shortage of ventilators.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “It gives me anxiety because what if we run out and we have an influx of patients like New York or even Italy, and we don’t have anything,” Chaffman said.   Chaffman said as someone with an underlying health condition, her job can go from stressful to dangerous.   “It terrifies me when I go to work every day. I’m afraid I’m going to get it and I’m going to be one of those patients on a vent,” she said.   Although the pressure is high, Chaffman said she finds comfort in her coworkers, knowing together, they will get through this.   “We are there for each other to talk to, to kind of calm ourselves and reassure that we’re here for another and we’re going to work and make it through,” Chaffman said.
