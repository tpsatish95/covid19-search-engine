Drive-in theaters, which combined America’s passion for automobiles and movies, peaked in popularity during the 1950s and early 1960s. Many closed down as more people chose to watch movies indoors or at home.   More than 40,000 movie theater screens nationwide are now dark and Americans sheltering in place are turning to drive-ins for much-needed out-of-the-house entertainment.   There were 305 drive-in theaters with a total of 549 screens throughout the United States as of October, according to the  United Drive-in Theater Owner Association .   While some drive-in theaters caught in the umbrella shutdown of non-essential services are still closed, others are starting to reopen.

Under normal circumstances, Airbnb will allow its hosts to set house rules about events or parties. May is normally a time for graduation celebrations, baby or bridal showers or other special events, but Airbnb says they won’t allow it.   “We have previously announced that we will not allow for hosts to authorize parties and events in regions where current public health mandates prohibit events and gatherings,” an Airbnb statement reads. “Governor Hogan’s executive order very clearly bans social gatherings in the state, meaning our new policy means we are not allowing any type of party in Baltimore until further notice.”   Baltimore City Health Commission Ask Residents Not To Throw Parties As Weather Gets Warmer   Currently under the governor’s order, gatherings of more than 10 people are discouraged. The city and state of Maryland are under a stay at home order, which means residents should stay at home unless they are going out for essential reasons or exercise.   “We want to be very clear — not only will we ban guests who attempt to throw an unauthorized party in a Baltimore Airbnb listing, we will be cooperating with Baltimore Police in any investigations relating to parties and violations of public health mandates, consistent with our Terms of Service,” the company added.   To further deter hosts or renters from throwing parties, the company has disable the event-friendly” search filter.   On Tuesday, city health commissioner Letitia Dzirasa also warned against residents throwing parties, because they are endangering their health and the health of others.   “As the weather begins to warm, we acknowledge that it will be increasingly difficult for residents who abide by the stay at home order,” said Dzirasa. “Just this past weekend, we saw a number of house party and cookout invitations go out on social media.”   Dzirasa reminded residents that if they are inviting friends over for a cookout, graduation ceremony, Cinco de Mayo or Mother’s Day brunch, they are putting themselves, their friends, family and neighbors at risk of contracting COVID-19.   Airbnb said it’s proud of its hosts that have opened up their rentals to frontline workers.   “During this challenging time, our host community has stepped up in an extraordinary way by offering 200,000 places to stay globally for COVID-19 responders through Airbnb’s Frontline Stays program,” a statement from Airbnb continues. “We are incredibly proud of hosts in cities around the world who have offered their homes to those on the front lines and in need of shelter, and we thank them for providing this critical need for safe accommodations at such an important moment in history.”   For latest information on our COVID-19 response, from policy updates to resources for hosts and guests, please visit  airbnb.com/covid19.

Washington, who was selected with the 170th overall pick in April’s draft, was a three-year starter and four-year contributor for the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the Big 12. The 6’2, 305-pound tackle earned honorable mention All-Big 12 honors after piling up 39 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks, 2 passes defensed and a fumble recovery as a senior in 2019.   As for the six undrafted free agents, the team signed a pair of cornerbacks in Khalil Dorsey and Josh Nurse, outside linebacker Marcus Willoughby, safety Nigel Warrior, tight end Eli Wolf and wide receiver Jaylon Moore.   Nurse (Utah) and Dorsey (Northern Arizona) add depth to a secondary that heads into 2020 looking like one of the league’s strongest. The pair combined for 84 games of experience at the college level. Nurse started 10 games for the Utes in 2019 opposite from Chicago Bears draft pick Jaylon Johnson. At 6’3″ 197, he’s on the bigger side for a corner, and that length helped him tie for third on the Utah team in passes defensed with six in 2019.   Dorsey, a 5’9″ 181 lbs, started in all four seasons for the Lumberjacks ending his career with 197 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 8 interceptions and 41 passes defensed in that span.   Warrior played in 49 games and started 38 including every game in 2019 for Tennessee. He earned second-team All-SEC honors in his senior season and finished his four-year career with 239 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 18 passes defensed, and 5 interceptions.   Willoughby was a captain for Elon in 2019, starting all 11 games and earning All-CAA second-team honors for posting 65 tackles, 13.5 for loss, and a pair of forced fumbles. He finished his career with the Phoenix amassing 224 tackles, 31 for loss and 16.5 sacks.   On the offensive side, Moore appeared in 39 games with 25 starts over the course of four years for Tennessee-Martin finishing with 92 receptions for 1,492 yards and 18 touchdowns in his career. Wolf, a 6’4″ 238-pound tight end from Georgia, was a grad transfer to the Bulldogs last season after spending the beginning of his college career at Tennessee.

As with everyone else, the league has had to rely on technology to do the heavy lifting of its offseason work.  Rather than the traditional organized team activities (OTAs) or minicamps, teams have been holding virtual meetings to begin installing the playbook and going over schemes while players continue to work out on their own in accordance with social-distancing guidelines.   The wonders of technology do help in allowing teams to still meet with players under these conditions, but it does raise the question of how these changes could affect play on the field. New NFL On CBS analyst Charles Davis says the closest parallel we can make is to the 2011 lockout year. Though admittedly not a perfect comparison (as Davis puts it, the stakes are much different), it is an interesting one to consider.   In that 2011 season, when the two sides were still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement deep into the summer, teams and players weren’t allowed to meet at all. In comparison, this offseason is better from a connectivity point of view, as teams have been able to meet virtually. It is in this way that Davis believes that, though the offseason is markedly different, teams will still be able to prepare for the fall.   “They couldn’t meet, they couldn’t talk, they couldn’t do anything,” said Davis of the 2011 season. “In this case, at least with our technology and being virtual and being connected, that has to help at least some. We won’t know the full results until we see how long they go before they can meet with each other on the field. I think the training and the learning will go as well as it can go in today’s era.”   Davis is quick to point out, however, that those meetings only take you so far. At some point teams getting on the field and practicing together needs to happen. How long that time away from the field extends will determine what we see on the field on Sundays.   While the league continues to work to determine how best to keep players, staffs and fans safe in returning to football, the rest of the offseason has gone on virtually. Teams filled their needs through free agency and the draft, and two in particular stood out to Davis in how well they did so: the Baltimore Ravens and Miami Dolphins.   On the other side, one of the more interesting or head-scratching offseasons belongs to the Green Bay Packers. Davis wasn’t necessarily surprised by the move to get quarterback Jordan Love (he did note in his  final mock draft  that the team could look QB in the first round), but he was surprised to see them go without taking a wide receiver in what was a talented receiver class.   “I don’t have as much problem with getting the quarterback because the last two times they have made big moves for quarterbacks it was to trade for Brett Favre and draft Aaron Rodgers,” said Davis. “As an organization, they ought to get the benefit of the doubt on that one. But I was surprised, as the rest of the draft unfolded, that in the deepest receiver crop we have had in 20 years, they didn’t draft a single receiver.”   It feels safe to say that Packers fans were surprised by their team’s moves in the draft as well. Overall, Davis is excited to watch several storylines play out in 2020. And he is thrilled to be doing so as part of the CBS Sports team, joining the network’s broadcast booth alongside Ian Eagle.   “It means the world to have the CBS Sports family led by Sean McManus deem me worthy first and foremost,” said Davis.   He then pointed out his good fortune in broadcast partners through the years. At FOX, Davis worked with Thom Brenaman, Gus Johnson, and Kevin Brukhardt just to name a few. Now, he joins Eagle, who has been covering the NFL for the network since 1998.   “I have been very fortunate, and this continues my incredible fortune to be able to work with someone of Ian’s talents, because he is as good as it gets,” said Davis.   The team of Eagle and Davis along with all of the NFL On CBS sports broadcast crew, will have football fans covered from the opening of the season up through Super Bowl LV on CBS in February of 2021.

(AP) —  Tampa Bay Rays minor leaguer Blake Bivens says he learned through social media of the deaths of three family members last summer.   Speaking publicly for what is believed to be the first time about the Aug. 28 deaths of wife Emily, 1-year-old son Culle and mother-in-law Joan Bernard, Bivens recalled details of traveling home to Keeling, Virginia, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he had been on a road trip with the Rays’ Double-A Montgomery affiliate.   The 24-year-old pitcher’s brother-in-law, Matthew Bernard, was arrested, charged with three counts of murder and is awaiting trial.   Bivens spoke for more than 30 minutes Sunday with interim senior pastor Travis Gore of The River Church during a conversation aired live on Facebook.   The athlete said his faith has helped him cope with the deaths.   “The only thing I really remember from the whole plane ride is I just went through periods. I just stared at the back of the seat the whole time, trying to get my mind to wrap around what I’m hearing,” Bivens said.   “It’s almost kind of like, `This isn’t really happening.’ I was more in a state of shock. I would go through periods of shaking,” he said. “Then I would start to lose it a little bit and break down and cry. It was kind of like a circle. The plane rides just seemed like they took forever.”   Bivens said he initially feared something was wrong when he awakened that day and had not received a text message from his wife.   The concern grew when he couldn’t reach her and he learned on Facebook that his brother-in-law was being sought by police. He returned to social media, searching for information, while sitting in the Chattanooga airport.   “First headline I see is two females and a small child were gone. I immediately knew that was them,” Bivens said. “I found out my family was gone over a Facebook headline. I just immediately began to scream in the middle of the airport.”   The pitcher said the trip home “could have been a whole lot worse for me” if he had not been accompanied by three members of the Rays organization, including Montgomery manager Morgan Ensberg.   “I think the hardest moment for me was when I got home and I walked in my son’s bedroom for the first time and realized I was never going to see him on this earth again,” Bivens said.   “That was the worst moment in my life. Nothing ever will come to feeling the way I felt at that moment.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

May is the best spring month to view meteor activity for those in the northern hemisphere, according to the  American Meteor Society.   However, this meteor shower favors skywatchers in the southern hemisphere, where between 20 and 40 meteors can be seen each hour. In the northern hemisphere, observers can expect to see between 10 and 30 meteors in the hours before dawn.   The meteor shower is expected to peak on the mornings of May 5 and 6, but it coincides with the coming full moon, which is also a supermoon, on May 7.   However, the waxing gibbous moon is expected to set during the early morning hours this weekend, providing a better opportunity to see the meteor shower on Sunday morning.   You can use  TimeandDate.com  to check when moonset occurs in your area. The amount of visible meteors will also be affected by weather conditions where you live.   The source of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is Halley’s Comet. Earth crosses the comet’s orbital path each spring between April and May. This happens again in October, which creates the Orionid meteor shower.   The meteors will be streaking across our sky at 151,200 miles per hour, and about half of them will leave persistent trains, which are glowing trails of energetic gas that remain for a few seconds after the passing of the meteor, according to  EarthSky .   They appear to be coming from the northeastern part of the Aquarius constellation, which contributes to the name of the shower.   If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights that will obstruct your view.   Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone — so meteors are easier to spot.

Modeling after the restaurant industry, families could place an order for a bag of books. The group picked out books based on the child’s age.   “It’s all contactless; we put it right in their trunk,” Fiering said. “So it’s pretty easy for us to do and were able to supply at least 10 books per child.”   In total, they’re giving out books to more than 400 kids, including avid reader Gregory Areford.   “You pick up a book and it takes you somewhere else,” the 15-year-old said.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants that could switch to curbside take out and delivery have done so. For many, however, the past few weeks have not been easy.   “Honestly they’ve been rough. Where we’re seeing 10 to 15 percent of the sales we would usually do,” Andrew Cole, of Between 2 Buns, said.   In an effort to help struggling local businesses, the Downtown Partnership has launched a new initiative called #CurbsideBaltimore.   “It’s an attempt to do a couple (of) things. One, to help put an infusion of cash into downtown restaurants, and it also provides incentives for residence, residents and people to come out and give back,” Shelonda Stokes, the group’s interim president, said.

There are currently 25 downtown businesses participating, including six at the Mount Vernon Market Place.

(CBS Local)  — Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has apologized for saying someone named Tupac Shakur, who had applied for unemployment in the state, was an example of fraud — when it was actually the person’s real name.  Beshear said Monday someone in Kentucky had applied for unemployment benefits for Tupac Shakur, the same name as the iconic hip-hop artist who was shot to death in 1996.   “One person, who thought they were funny, is going to make tens of thousands of other people wait. Not OK. We can’t be doing that,” the governor said.   The governor’s office said Beshear was advised that a fraudulent claim had been filed in the name of Tupac Shakur. They say it now appears that a Kentuckian by that name has filed a legitimate claim,  CBS affiliate WKYT  reports.   Beshear says he called Tupac Malik Shakur, a 46-year-old Lexington resident who lost his job as a cook at a restaurant, Tuesday morning to apologize and that the Office of Unemployment Insurance is working to resolve the claim.   “I talked to him on the phone today. I apologized. I told him how it happened, but I owned it. It’s my fault. He was gracious,” said Beshear.   “I said I’m sorry if I embarrassed him or caused him any attention he didn’t want. He was very kind. He ended the call, ‘God bless.’ And we’re gonna make sure we resolve his claim,” he added.   Shakur said he appreciated the call and that he forgave Beshear for the error.   “I understand, he’s dealing with a lot,” Shakur told the  Lexington Herald-Leader . “Mistakes happen.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.12958333333333333, "subjectivity": 0.49074074074074076, "wordcount": 268}

(AP) —  While many businesses are struggling nationwide with paying salaries and dealing with layoffs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the theater industry has been hit particularly hard.   With some jobs, working remotely is still possible. However, what about an industry where its primary source of income is heavily reliant on audiences gathering in one place?   It has not been easy. In Annapolis, the outdoor Summer Garden Theatre has to rent space in order to rehearse. However, since the shutdown orders, the rehearsal space has been closed, and rehearsing has been hard, Carolyn Kirby, president of the board of directors at the theater, told Capital News Service on March 30 via a phone call.   The theater’s season has three shows scheduled, with the first one, “Rock of Ages,” having been in its last stages of completion. It was postponed to the 2021 season even after having had about nine months of work done on it, but “now everything is in question,” Kirby said.   For a performance in July, she said, you need more practice. However, the theater and board members are having to work with “a day-to-day solution.”   Another Annapolis theater has been in a similar situation. The Colonial Players, a non-profit, all-volunteer organization had to push back their shows as well, as a result of the pandemic.   The theater does own its rehearsal and performance space, but has financial concerns over production deposits that have already been made and the salaries for the support staff, since the theater does not have any income coming in.   Steve Tobin, the vice president of the Colonial Players, said via a phone interview that the theater is very thankful for donations in lieu of tickets from the community.   The donations are tax-deductible donations to the theater.   “We’re very grateful that it looks right now—at least right now—that the financial impacts are not as bad as they could have been,” Tobin said, thanks to the donations.   He continued that though people have their own financial issues, they still donate — and that is “very heartwarming.”   “Through their generosity, we will be able to recover relatively quickly in the fall,” Tobin said. “That’s a gift from our patrons.”   The Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre also faces production-related financial concerns.   Having to give refunds to people who have already bought tickets “is a scary situation,” Kirby said.   She said that $43,000 worth of tickets were sold and now the situation is extremely uncertain, with the team having to consider canceling their upcoming shows.   Aside from the financial concerns, the performance and production teams also face a disappointment factor — of having worked months on a show and not getting to perform.   The Colonial Players, the Annapolis Summer Garden Theatre and the Annapolis Shakespeare Company expressed disappointment over the loss of shows.   Shirley Panek, president of the Colonial Players theater, also works as the vice president of a technology firm — as do most of the theater’s volunteers. “We do what we do because it’s a passion,” she said.   “Just because we don’t pay people, doesn’t mean that we haven’t put in blood sweat and tears,” Tobin said.   “They (the performers) are disappointed, but they understand,” Kirby said.   Sally Boyett, artistic director with the Annapolis Shakespeare Company, told Capital News Service that their theater had to lay off all their staff except for her and another member.   Boyett said it was devastating to see people she had employed for a show watch that show be shut down.   She continued that though they understand “what has to happen for the public health” that it doesn’t take away from the devastation it has caused for the artists.   One of the key issues coming back from the pandemic shutdowns will be to get the audiences to get back into the habit of watching the plays, Boyett said.   Though she continued that she hopes for the best as “there’s only so much Netflix you can take.”   Jason Vellon works at Sandy Spring Bank, and also as a performer.   Though most community performers do it for the enjoyment of the work rather than the monetary compensation, he said that having a show canceled “is like a death, it’s like something is being ripped from you.”   Vellon and his wife, Ashley Gladden-Vellon, were set to perform this week at the Anne Arundel Community College Theater for the show “Beauty and the Beast” and through a tough audition, his wife was cast as Belle and he as Gaston.   When the director, who is also Vellon’s friend, was telling his wife that the show had to be canceled, she started shedding tears, and so did the director.   “You know that, that it was the right choice to stop that show,” Vellon said. “But it is still a painful loss.”   “Being on stage, it’s kind of like a drug,” he said. But he continued that “for us, it’s part of who we are.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The neighborhoods around the course have been heavily affected by the virus, with 64 cases reported in the 21215 zip code. That’s more than any other part of Baltimore.   Some area residents said it was a good idea to build the site at Pimlico.   “We get sick just like everybody else, you know what I mean? And we need it just like everybody else,” Edward Holden, of Park Heights, said.   The Baltimore City Health Department and Office of Emergency Management will operate the site with the help of the Maryland National Guard, LifeBridge Health and other partners.   But, as Amanda Shrout with Sinai Hospital explained, you’ll need to get screened before coming to get tested.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Our patients are able to call 211 and they are put through a screening process,” Shrout said. “Then if they’re deemed appropriate to have COVID-19 testing, they are given an appointment.”   Patients will come in off the Belvedere Avenue entrance and be met by the National Guard who will then confirm the appointment.   They’ll remain in their car the whole time, except when being swabbed, and will then get the results back in four to five days.   Lifelong resident David Hollins said that regardless of what’s happening in the neighborhood, he‘s just glad to see a site created in the city.   “It’s the fact that it’s in Baltimore, period,” Hollins said. “And that’s where it’s needed so it doesn’t really matter what side of town it’s on. They’ve got a lot of space here, so that makes sense to me.”   The city tells WJZ that they are continuing to analyze the data and that will drive where their resources will go.

Their choice became clear. Marriage was far more important than planned dances and elaborate spreads.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Really think about why we do things and just get to the heart of each matter,” Kevin said. “What’s really important.

They’re thankful for technology that even allowed Stephanie’s dad to virtually walk her down the aisle.   “I have a mother who is a breast cancer survivor, who has a weakened immune system, and so she wasn’t able to travel,” Kevin said. “I have a sister who is pregnant, who is not able to travel. Just a lot of the things that were important to us, like having family their, became a disappointment when we knew that they couldn’t come. But overall, we’ve been really content, it’s been a good time to just reflect on what really is important.”   “We were in love and wanted to be with each other,” Kevin added.   With all kinds of milestones being pushed and postponed, the couple wants you to know your feelings are valid.   “It’s okay to grieve the fact that this is not normal,” Stephanie said. “I think we live in such a fast paced society that we thought we’d get the fixer upper soon, like this will be fixed.”   We don’t know what fixed looks like just yet, but the Greer’s are blissfully aware in their newlywed nest.   “I mean sure, her stuff is where my stuff should be,” Kevin joked. “I have the whole closet.”   They are now encouraging everyone to create your own happily every after.   “We recognize our situation isn’t like everybody else’s and there are a lot of things that can’t move and shift for someone to have our same story. That’s built in us a lot of gratitude,” Stephanie said. “And then think, ‘Ok, what can I focus on that is going great, what can I be grateful for?'”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

A Harford County parking lot, which is usually bustling with customers, now has socially distanced spaced lines at the few booths that are open.   “A little bit different today, not a lot of stands open, but a fair number of people keeping an eye on the social distancing,” a customer told WJZ.   The farmers marker in Bel Air attracts hundreds of families most spring weekends.   “A lot more vendors, a lot of dogs, it’s just nice even when it is packed like that. We know we are supporting local business, so I appreciate that,” another customer said.   Supporting these businesses, to Hillary Tayson, is like a trip to the grocery store.

Smoking marijuana, even occasionally, can increase your risk for more severe complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.   “What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo,  chief medical officer for the American Lung Association . “Now you have some airway inflammation and you get an infection on top of it. So, yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”   Hey wait, you might say, I’ve only just started and I’m not smoking much — so what’s the harm?   The problem, said Dr. Mitchell Glass, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the American Lung Association, is that the last thing you want during a pandemic is to make it more difficult for a doctor to diagnose your symptoms.   “Covid-19 is a pulmonary disease,” Glass said. “Do you really want to have a confounding variable if you need to see a doctor or a healthcare worker by saying, ‘Oh, and by the way, I’m not a regular user of cannabis, but I decided to use cannabis to calm myself down.’   “You don’t want to do anything that’s going to confound the ability of healthcare workers to make a rapid, accurate assessment of what’s going on with you,” he added.   Is that cough from smoking or coronavirus?   “Chronic” marijuana smoking, defined as daily use, damages the lungs over a period of time. The end result “looks a lot like chronic bronchitis, which is of course one of the terms we use for chronic obstructive lung disease, or COPD,” Glass said.   Smokers, people with COPD and other chronic lung diseases, as well as people with moderate to severe asthma are  among those at high risk  for severe illness from Covid-19, including the worst-case scenario of being placed on a ventilator in order to continue breathing.   Signs of lung damage from smoking even just a few cigarettes can show up in a matter of days. While a hit or two of marijuana doesn’t compare, there are some unique properties to a joint of weed that are definitely problematic for the lungs even if you’re a new smoker, Glass said.   Think of what happens to a cigarette when lit and left in an ashtray — it will burn quickly all the way down to the filter, with nothing left but ash.   “It’s surrounded by paper. It’s completely dried out. It is made to burn at a very high temperature,” Glass said.   Now think of how a joint burns — there’s always some weed left, the “roach,” as it is called.   “Marijuana burns at a much, much lower temperature than a commercially made cigarette,” said Glass. “Because of that, the person is inhaling a certain amount of unburnt plant material.”   That irritates the lungs in the same manner as ragweed, birch and oak pollen does for those allergic to them, he said.   “So right off the bat there are those patients who would be increasingly susceptible to having a bronchospasm or cough because they have a more sensitive airway.”   And since a dry cough is a key sign of Covid-19, any cough caused by smoking a joint of weed could easily mimic that symptom, making diagnosis more difficult.   The need for a clear head   There’s another factor as well. As we all know, weed not only calms you down, but it messes with your ability to function — and that does you no favors if you find yourself having a medical emergency during a pandemic.   “You’re reducing anxiety, but that is still a change in your thinking, a change in the way you are handling facts, how you’re grasping situations,” Glass said.   “Now there’s a healthcare worker who is gowned, gloved, possibly in a hazmat suit trying to get through to you. These are people who are trying to decide if you should be going home, coming into the emergency room, or worst case scenario, that you need to be put on a ventilator,” he continued.   “They want the person who’s agreeing and giving informed consent to be completely in control of their thought processes.”   More Americans are using weed   In 2018, more than 43 million Americans aged 12 or older reported using marijuana in the past year, according to the  2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  (PDF).   Around four million of those are people with “marijuana use disorder, meaning that this has escalated to the point where it’s a problem in their lives,” said Jessica Hulsey, founder of the  Addiction Policy Forum , which advocates on behalf of patients and families struggling with substance use disorder and addiction.   “Experts at the National Institutes of Health released some guidance for our patients and our families. saying marijuana use disorder could be a risk factor for complications from Covid-19,” Hulsey said.   “Because it attacks the lungs, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape,” t he NIH said in its announcement.   “We need to make sure that these users are aware that marijuana is in essence an underlying health condition,” Hulsey added. “They should take extra precautions by minimizing use to the extent that is possible, and even start virtual treatment and a recovery journey while everyone’s stuck at home.”   The national drug survey also found more than a third of young adults aged 18 to 25 said they used marijuana during 2018, along with more than 13% of adults aged 26 or older.   But it’s not just the young. Earlier this year, a study found  use by older adults is rising sharply.  In 2006, only 0.4% of people over 65 reported using marijuana products in the past year. By 2018, over 4% of those same aged seniors say they are now using, the study found.   “Marijuana use among seniors is not bouncing up and down like with other drugs. It’s a straight line up,” said study co-author Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, in an interview in February.   Are even more Americans turning to weed during this time of crisis?   Simply put, no one knows. Each state handles reporting differently, Glass says, and sales estimates often combine both THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana that produces the “high,” and CBD, the medicinal compound that is now sold over the counter.   “I made a few phone calls and the numbers ranged quite literally from a million to 30 million. So who knows how many people are getting their hands on cannabis to relieve their anxiety during this time,” Glass said.   What to do?   If you’re not a regular smoker of marijuana, don’t start, experts say.   “Don’t confound your caregivers with trying to sort out whether your dry cough and change in behavior is due to the fact that you’re a novice with marijuana or it’s associated with Covid-19,” Glass said.   “If you do need to see a caregiver, be sure you’re very honest with them about when you last used, and how often you use,” Glass said, “so they can get a good, clear story on what the impact of inhaling marijuana is on you.”   Remember the bottom line when it comes to smoking and Covid-19, Rizzo said.   “It’s common sense that anything you inhale that has been combusted and contains particles or chemicals can inflame your airways,” he said. “So you’re already making your body fight off foreign particles before it even has to fight off the infection.”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

While these public health strategies are working to protect the American people, they result in catastrophic damage to state economies.   “Despite this grave challenge, the recently passed federal CARES Act contained zero funding to offset these drastic state revenue shortfalls. To stabilize state budgets and to make sure states have the resources to battle the virus and provide the services the American people rely on, Congress must provide immediate fiscal assistance directly to all states.    “We must be allowed to use any state stabilization funds for replacement of lost revenue, and these funds should not be tied to only COVID-19 related expenses. Congress must amend the CARES Act to allow this flexibility for existing federal funding.    “Moreover, Congress must appropriate an additional $500 billion specifically for all states and territories to meet the states’ budgetary shortfalls that have resulted from this unprecedented public health crisis. This critical stabilization funding for states must be separate from much needed fiscal stabilization for local governments.    “In the absence of unrestricted fiscal support of at least $500 billion from the federal government, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to critically important services all across this country, hampering public health, the economic recovery, and—in turn—our collective effort to get people back to work.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland       What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland       Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In Baltimore city, officials say they will lose $103 million in revenue during fiscal year 2021 which starts on July 1.

Since the coronavirus pandemic shut down Italy, her hobby has become more important than ever to help her feel connected to herself.   Italy had at least 135,000 Covid-19 cases as of April 8, and the virus-stricken country requires its residents to travel with government documents detailing where they’re going and why.   Corradini and her boyfriend have been on lockdown together for almost a month now, only leaving to buy groceries and deliver food to her boyfriend’s parents.   “I can say that [baking] is saving my days and my mind,” she said. “It has never been more important to have a hobby than it is now.”   She’s in good company. People around the world — including nearly all Americans — have been advised or ordered to stay home. Many are taking up bread baking to fill the time and easy their nerves — and enjoy some good bread as a result.   Corradini bakes daily, primarily to pass the long hours of isolation but also to build a community of bread bakers on Instagram, where followers keep each other updated on ingredient availability and exchange advice.   “Baking bread to me is really therapeutic. It makes me feel alive and connected with myself and my dexterity,” she said. “I think it is very important now to re-evaluate our priorities and stay more in touch with ourselves, too.”   She’s also happy to slow down.   “I enjoy the fact that bread making is a slow process, which goes against the rapid lives that we live normally,” Corradini said. “Making bread is slow and engaging, therefore it’s a privilege. Having time and energy to dedicate to this hobby is a privilege. [And] it’s exciting, because you never know the outcome.”   Baking can help your mental health   It’s no surprise that Corradini’s quarantine baking hobby makes her feel better, experts say.   Baking provides a sense of accomplishment, “especially in this period of angst and unknowns,” said Michael Kocet, a licensed mental health counselor and professor and department chair of the Counselor Education Department at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.   Baking can give us something concrete to create, control and enjoy when we have the finished product. That can help reduce the anxiety stemming from the unfamiliarity of dealing with a pandemic, he added.   Specific parts of the baking process also teach lessons applicable to our daily lives and can lead to a state of mindfulness, Kocet said. Kneading, waiting for it to rise, scoring and standing by while it bakes give us time to reflect — and those steps all require patience and precision that can help someone feel centered and focused.   “You may have to prepare the dough and wait to let it rise overnight. There’s a period of waiting that I think is very symbolic of the waiting we’re collectively doing,” Kocet said.   The research backs Kocet up. One study on baking’s impact on mental health found it helped participants gain a sense of purpose, structure their days and increase their motivation levels.   “With baking bread there’s a lot of physicality, and the kneading of the dough and getting it into the right shape can help you relieve some tension,” said Elizabeth McKay, author of the study and associate professor of occupational therapy at Edinburgh Napier University.   Taking on a recipe, such as beginning a sourdough starter, seeing progress from week to week and receiving positive feedback from others can increase confidence levels, McKay said.   “That’s where social media is so good because people are like, ‘Whoa, you made that?’ Even in our shutdown days, you can put it on social media where people give you feedback, and I think that really helps as well,” she added.   Looking out for loved ones   Abigail Rudolph has turned to social media to take orders for her bread.   A teacher who always helped her mother and grandmother in the kitchen when she was young, Rudolph has been baking on and off her whole life, taking what her family matriarchs taught her and making it her own.   When New Mexico closed the public schools, baking was naturally the way she wanted to spend her free time. It also helps ease her depression and anxiety.   “This whole situation has been hard on all of us,” she said. “The baking gives me something positive to focus my mind on, and as a result I get to bring a little happiness into the lives of the people I care about. They’re also doing the same for me.”   Baking gives her a way to check in with loved ones to make sure they’re not “falling off the edge.” It also helps ease her concern that maybe she’s not doing enough to help others.   “It’s something I can do well, a small way that I can put some good out into the world when it feels like it’s falling apart,” Rudolph said. “It keeps me on track and focused during a time when my normal routines aren’t there to support me.”   Through her Instagram profile, Rudolph asks her friends to make baking requests, which she promises to deliver from six feet away within the week.   “The process of getting the requests, making my plans, executing them, chronicling the experience and sharing the recipes is what’s keeping me sane,” Rudolph said. “Each new project keeps me from getting lost in the negativity and guilt, and gives me a sense of purpose.”   How to start baking   If you could use a little baking therapy in your life, Kocet encourages starting with a recipe you’ve always wanted to try, joining a virtual baking club or participating in sharing your photos on social media with the hashtag #quarantinebaking, where other baking fanatics await.   If bread flour or yeast is in short supply in your area — since so many people are baking — why not try a no-yeast bread recipe or even a gluten-free one? Irish soda bread is yeast-free, and there are more than a few hundred gluten-free recipes online.   Some quarantined neighbors in San Francisco have gotten creative by swapping sourdough starters at a safe distance by putting them in plastic bags and tacking them to phone poles.   If you feel stressed about getting started, know that it’s not about creating or baking the perfect loaf of bread. It’s about enjoying oneself as much as we can, experimenting, trying something new, then sharing it virtually, Kocet said.   “Even though this is a difficult time and we don’t know how long this is going to happen, this could clearly go into the summer or much further,” he added.   “How will people maintain their mental health and wellness? Cooking and baking can certainly be a way to do that.”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

So, it’s no surprise that when Spotrac released their latest payroll accounting for every team in the league, the O’s find themselves last in MLB with a total payroll of $46,308,782.   But, the Orioles can say something no other team can: one player makes up 45% of that payroll! That honor, of course, belongs to first baseman Chris Davis, who is due a little over $21.1 million this season. The 34-year-old first baseman struggled again in 2019 posting a .179 batting average with 12 homers and 36 RBI in 105 games. The .179 average was an improvement over 2018 when Davis hit .168 with 16 homers and 49 RBI.   Davis was hopeful about turning things around in 2020 and he had gotten off to a good start in Spring Training with seven hits in 15 at bats (.467 average), including three home runs and nine RBI. Most promising was the nine walks he racked up against just three strikeouts.   Davis isn’t the only O’s player counting for a significant portion of the team’s payroll either. Starting pitcher Alex Cobb is on the books for $14 million. Combined with Davis, that accounts for 60% of the team’s payroll for the upcoming season. Cobb appeared in just three games for the team in 2019 before needing season-ending hip surgery.   The 2020 season is still suspended as the league works on plans to potentially return to play. When they do, the Orioles will have the distinction of holding the league’s smallest payroll despite paying big money to two veterans.

Your starter becomes a living thing with a totally unique identity, almost like a pet, or at least a  houseplant ; you care for it and, in a sense, it cares for you. These sourdough starter tips will help you get the hang of it.  Creating a sourdough starter is not a complicated process—you just mix flour and water together and wait—but then what? It’s time to start the feeding and maintenance process. There are a few tips and tricks to help you maintain a long and  healthy  relationship with your starter.

Grab my beginner recipe on the blog right now… all you need is flour, water, and a little bit of time.

The truth is that there’s no “wrong” answer, and it’s purely a matter of preference. Starter is fed with a ratio of the original ferment to water and flour.   I maintain what’s considered a thick starter. It’s a forgiving and sturdy ferment (her name is Rose) that has a medium-to-strong sourness. The ratio for mine is 1:2:3, which translates to one part starter, two parts water, and three parts flour, by volume. I use room temperature starter, just slightly warm filtered (tap) water and unbleached, all-purpose flour.                                 View this post on Instagram                                            My three starters! Part of an upcoming writing project, I’m pleased to introduce these girls: (L to R) Maude, Betty, and Rose. Maude and Betty are just a few weeks old, and Rose is the elder lady, at more than three years of age. All were fed at the same time this morning, and were all at the line of the rubber band about six hours ago. As you can see, Rose is the most active but I’m excited to bake with all of these lovelies this weekend and compare the results. #breadnerding #sourdough #starters #sourdoughstarter #wildyeast #eatlikeamother #chicagobreadclub #chicagobaker #procrastibaking   A post shared by   Heather Lynn Reid  (@eatlikeamother_312) on  Mar 5, 2020 at 1:09pm PST         For a typical feeding, I mix 100 grams of starter, 200 grams of water, and 300 grams of flour. I let the ferment sit at room temperature for 4-6 hours (or until tripled in volume) before I put it to work. If I’m not going to bake until the next day or after that, I let her sit out for 3-4 hours and then refrigerate. When I’m ready to rock, I bring her out and let her come to room temperature again (about an hour) before baking.   Another popular ratio is 1:1:1, which means if you start with 100 grams of starter, you add 100 grams of water and 100 grams of flour. This creates a ferment that’s thinner (more like pancake batter), but it’s also quite versatile and easy to convert to other types of flour if you want.   If your starter is healthy, you should notice that it is bubbly and fragrant and should double/triple in volume after a few hours.   Can You Feed Sourdough Starter With Other Types Of Flour?     As I mentioned, I use unbleached all-purpose flour, but you can use whatever you prefer. Whole-wheat, barley, einkorn, spelt, rye, even rice flour all work well and create distinct flavor profiles that will transfer into your bread or other baked goods.   Avoid buckwheat because it’s actually not a grain, but rather a seed that’s related to rhubarb. There are methods to making a  gluten-free buckwheat starter  that involve a more complicated fermentation process, but adding it raw won’t work for your starter.   Having trouble finding flour in stores (in-person and online) right now? It might be worth  reaching out to a local bakery .   A Special Note About Rye   Rye flour is a (not so) secret weapon for sourdough bakers! If your starter is taking a long time to double, it may be lacking some of the microbial strength it needs to do its job in your baking. I regularly substitute about 10 percent of my AP flour when feeding for rye flour. I think it supercharges my starter and adds a slightly sweet and nutty flavor.

Such a plump little loaf, which is how I felt about myself today after yesterday’s feast! 😂😱🤦‍♀️ . . . #eatlikeamother #sourdough #igbreadclub #breadsofinstagram #herbsdeprovence #francophile #baker #homemade #wildyeast   A post shared by   Heather Lynn Reid  (@eatlikeamother_312) on  Nov 23, 2018 at 4:28pm PST         What Happens If You Forget To Feed Your Starter?   The general rule is not to let your starter go longer than two weeks without being fed, but we all know that it happens.   If you come across a starter that you’ve ignored for a bit too long, you may not be out of luck. Check the starter carefully: If there is any mold or fuzz growing on it, throw it out. If it’s been sitting unfed for a while, you probably will see some grayish liquid on the top. This is called the ‘hooch,’ a naturally occurring alcohol that’s part of the sourdough fermentation process. Pour it off and discard that liquid. Feed the desired quantity of the remaining starter, and feed it more often than usual over the next few days (every 6-12 hours) to revive your old friend. Keep in mind that the volume will triple each time, so you don’t have to start with a very large quantity of ferment.   For example, if you use a 1:1:1 ratio for your feeding, and you feed 20 grams of starter you’ll have 60 grams after the first feeding; 180 after the second; and 360 after the third, and so forth. So don’t despair if you are starting with a small quantity. With a few feeds, your starter will be back in action: bubbly, happy, and ready for your next baking adventure.

Now, several arts organizations are banding together to create a relief fund for artists affected by the pandemic.   The Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts has set up the “Baltimore Artists Emergency Relief Fund,” a joint partnership effort designed to provide direct assistance to the city’s artists and entrepreneurs who have lost income due to COVID-19.   “If we don’t support them now, they’re not going to be there for us later. Artists are the ones with the life and the breath of the community. They give us life, they give us vitality,” said BOPA’s arts council director Jocquelyn Downs.   The fund started off with $20,000 but has since risen to $95,000. The group’s goal is to raise $125,000.   To help with immediate needs, the coalition is offering one-time grants of $500 to struggling individual artists in the city.   “We really want to support them and show that we see them,” Downs said.

Gig after gig and paycheck after paycheck were canceled within a matter of days for reasons beyond anyone’s control.   “Many people all over the place rely on artists to relieve that stress,” Nichole said. “You go to bars and you hear the person in the corner playing the acoustic guitar, you go and see a show.”   The artists aren’t just artists — many have families to support.   “I’m a single mother. I have two children who are both out of school, so … you talk about canceling eight weeks of events but still having to support them with new technology for distance learning,” Nichole said.

He said the strike team assessed the facility and determined it is “taking appropriate steps to contain the outbreak.”   Cecil County Health Officer Laura Levy spoke this weekend to the continued lack of testing resources.   “Unfortunately, the testing kit availability remains limited, and so we have to be strategic about our use of testing kits,” Levy said.

(WJZ) —  Three in-person voting centers will be open for the 7th congressional district special general election on April 28 for voters who can’t get their ballots cast by mail, the Maryland State Board of Elections decided on Monday.  One voting center will be open in each local jurisdiction; Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County.   The State Board is still recommending that all 7th district voters who can vote by mail do so. The Board mailed ballots to all eligible voters in the 7th district in early April, including a return envelope and prepaid postage.   They will announce the locations by April 20.   “The safest way to vote in the 7th District special election is to vote by mail,” said Linda Lamone, State Administrator of Elections. “Not every voter can cast a ballot by mail, and the Board is committed to safeguarding their voting rights by authorizing local boards to operate a select few in-person voting centers. For all voters who are able to send in their ballot by mail, the choice is clear: vote safe, vote by mail.”       Maryland’s 7th Congressional District covers portions of the City of Baltimore, Baltimore County, and Howard County, respectively.   The special election is being held to fill the remainder of the term of the 116th Congress, after it was lefty empty due to the death of Representative Elijah Cummings in October 2019.   Maryland’s primary presidential election was postponed earlier this year to June 2, 2020, and the State Board has recommended that  there be no in-person voting.

Billy Gardell stars as Bob in his second go with America’s Most Watched Network after his successful run on  Mike And Molly .  CBS Local’s Matt Weiss caught up with Gardell to discuss the show’s first season and his ultimate goal for bringing happiness to viewer’s TVs.   MW:  Good morning Billy, the last time we spoke you talked about how happy you were just happy to get a second chance  after  Mike and Molly , so now that you’re almost through a full season of  Bob Hearts Abishola  how do you feel about the project now?   BG:  You know man, I’m blown away by what’s happened this year. It’s such a sweet, kind show and it’s received so wonderfully. We had a freshman hit and to have a freshman hit on sitcom now is crazy. When you’re on a hit sitcom, you think the second one won’t go this well but this show has been a great ensemble cast.    I think Chuck  Lorre  found a beautiful temperature between a working-class family and a family of hardworking immigrants that want to make a better life for their family. They connected beautifully in a real way. I think there’s a real kindness to our show and the collaboration and again, the ensemble, every character is funny, every character is interesting and that’s a Chuck  Lorre  staple. So, I’m blown away and I’m so grateful for the success of this show this year. Really am.     MW:  Awesome. You talked about the strong characters. Your character Bob is a huge part of everything. What did you learn playing that character as the season went along?     BG:  You put on the character for the pilot and then you start adding nuances, you start understanding. He would be aggravated at that, or he would like that, or this is probably a habit he has . With all those little things; the character becomes more real. Again, it’s about trust of the cast. My co-star,  Folake   Olowofoyeku  is her name, she was a stage actor from England and they found her, and she has this powerful stoicism and yet she can light the room up when she smiles.   Then they found these other beautiful actors to play her family Barry  Shabaka  [Henley], Shola [ Adewusi ]. And on my  side,  we have Christine Ebersole, Matt Jones, and Maribeth [Monroe] . What Chuck does better than anybody is he finds people that you believe and people that you believe know each other. He always says character, character, character because if I don’t care about them, I’m not watching. I don’t care how good the jokes are. We really have this nice chemistry and I can’t believe I landed in it twice. I cannot believe that.     MW:  You’re a blessed man.     BG:  My wife says I have a horseshoe in my ass.    [laughs]     MW:  That’s another way to say it. [laughs] Shifting gears, with everything going on in the world right now, your show has so much positivity. It’s such a great message of inclusion and everyone coming together and really uplifting. What does it mean for you to put on a show with that kind of message with things going on in the world the way they are right now?     BG:  I don’t proport to be better than anybody, smarter than anybody, faster than anybody, any of that stuff, all I know is if you do a television show well and it doesn’t matter what form of entertainment you’re in, whether it’s reporting, whether it’s radio, it’s movies, the most you could hope for is to be a distraction from people’s problems from the time you’re on. I think if you keep it there, your motivation stays right, and your focus stays right, that’s all we’re doing.    Today it doesn’t matter what we think or what your beliefs are we all have one problem and we have to come together as one people. I think in doing that it takes a lot of effort and I think we need  distractions  during the day  that entertain us so that we can get back to focusing on what we need to do. That’s all we’re hoping for; to provide a half hour of laughs for you on Monday night.      MW:  And doing an awesome job of it as well.     BG:  Thanks. I’m proud of the show. The show says a lot of nice things, it’s about learning about each other and being kind and funny and giving each other room to understand each other. I think that’s an important message, very important.     MW:  So as we come up on this week’s episode, what do you want people to know before we tune in tonight?   BG:  well, for one It’s not the season finale. We shut down two weeks early. You do 22 episodes for a full season. We did 20. Tonight, is number 20. So, there’s still room to go. We have 21 and the season finale. We’ll probably do that in August when we come back or September, whatever it takes.    Tonight, is another entertaining episode that kind of pushes us towards the finale. I think what they’re going to do is re-air the show for people who haven’t seen it. So that will be nice that it will be on to give people who haven’t seen it to get a chance to check out the show.     MW:  And they should. It’s an awesome show, it’s been a big hit and a little something people need right now.     BG:  Thanks. Yeah, that’s all you can do. I can’t do what our first responders do , God bless them all and our grocers, all those people. If I can get you to laugh, then I’m here to do that. I’m grateful the way America has stopped when it has to, and I hope we can all get on the same page with this so we can get through this with the least damage as possible.      MW:  And in the meantime, wherever that horseshoe is, keep it right where it is because it’s paying dividends.      BG:  Right!   [Laughs]    I’m a lucky man, I’ve been blessed. My wife of 20 years, she keeps me very grounded. She keeps me remembering what’s important. Connect with your family in this time, try to find  those moments that are very important that you might otherwise might not be able to have. There’s a way to get through everything, it’s a day at a time, sometimes it’s an hour at a time. We will endure, but we have to look out for each other. I’m just blessed and try to help out where I can.     MW:  Thank you so much Billy. It’s been awesome talking to you, enjoy the rest of your day.      BG:  You too. I hope I talk to you next year; I hope we’re outdoors and we’re having coffee somewhere, how about that.      MW:  Deal.     BG:  Be well!   Tune in tonight at 8:30 PM ET/PT for an all-new  Bob Hearts Abishola . Check your local listings for more information.

In a six-page order filed Monday, Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera ordered judges in circuit courts to weigh a number of factors in cases involving juveniles, including the juvenile’s risk for contracting COVID-19, whether releasing a juvenile poses a threat to their safety or the safety of the community and whether supervised release could allow the juvenile to be released safely.   Judges should avoid placing juvenile offenders in jail unless necessary and should look for alternative placements, according to the order. In addition, hearings should be held every 14 days to evaluate if detention is necessary.   Barbera cited the presence of the virus in juvenile facilities as one of the reasons for the updated guidance.

(WJZ) —  Governor Larry Hogan told the Trump administration Monday that governors need more support to respond to COVID-19.  “Governors are on the front lines of the on-the-ground response, implementing aggressive measures that are beginning to successfully flatten the curve of the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 response is resulting in catastrophic damage to state economies, and fiscal assistance is critical now so that we can continue leading this fight,” he said.   Governors are urging Congress to “act immediately” and appropriate $500 billion specifically for states and territories to meet “budgetary shortfalls” due to the coronavirus pandemic.   “Without sufficient federal relief, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to essential services, which will in turn devastate the economic recovery and our efforts to get people back to work.” He said.

In an appearance on CNN Monday afternoon, Hogan also urged caution to avoid re-opening businesses too quickly.   “Nobody wants to hurt the economy and put people out of work, but mainly we are talking about saving lives,“ the governor said. “The difference between tens of thousands of people dying or bringing that down so we don’t overload the healthcare system, that has got to be our first priority.“   Hogan said governors — not the president — will make the decision on when states will lift stay-at-home orders.   According to state comptroller Peter Franchot, Maryland is expected to see a $2.8 billion shortfall in the final quarter of this fiscal year.

(WJZ) —  At least forty-one grocery workers have died nationwide from the coronavirus,  according to the Washington Post.   Now, workers are saying the CDC guidelines don’t go far enough to properly protect them or their customers.   During a press call with the largest food and retail union Monday, members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union voiced some of their biggest frustrations.   Jane St. Louis works at the Safeway in Damascus, Maryland. She’s been an employee there for more than 27 years.   “A lot of them are still not wearing masks,” she said. “People are not social distancing… that is huge.”   The union’s president Marc Perrone said some of the blame lies with shoppers themselves.   “The careless customers are probably the biggest threat we have right now,” to his millions of union members, he said.

In a nationwide poll UFCW conducted, 5,000 grocery workers were asked to describe in one word how they felt about going to work. Many answered “anxious, worried, stressed or scared.”   The CDC is recommending everyone wear face coverings outside of the home, but the union is calling on the CDC to require it for all grocery workers.   In Prince George’s County, face coverings are  now mandatory in supermarkets  for both employees and customers.   “This is about life or death, workers are being exposed and they are dying,” Perrone said.

CNN reports  a nearly 900 percent increase in the use of crisis hotlines.   With the constant barrage of headlines about the death toll rising and countless people losing jobs, it can be hard to stay positive, but a Baltimore mental health professional said it’s important to remain socially connected despite being physically apart.   “We want, we need safe physical distancing but we want social network enhancement, social closeness is what we are seeking,” said Dr. Elias Shaya with MedStar Health’s behavioral health department.   Another way to stay in a good headspace is to keep a routine by eating meals at the same time and getting enough — but not too much — sleep, he said.

Will Arcentelas said he’s also spending time outside to get some fresh air.   “I always follow the order about the time until 8 but before that, I can go outside and play soccer,” he said.   The sun can play a significant role in one’s overall mood, Dr. Shaya said, because it’s filled with nutrients people need.   “Going outside, getting fresh air, but also getting sun exposure is great or even coming close to the window,” he said.   He also recommends limiting the amount of negativity people see on social media and TV.

City and state governments all over the country have closed restaurant dining rooms, which were never really set up with social distancing in mind anyway. Only delivery and takeout orders are allowed for the foreseeable future.  Many restaurants have shifted to the new, hopefully short-lived reality. Many more have closed entirely. Whether they’re gone for now or gone for good remains to be seen. But for the time being most restaurant staffers find themselves unemployed, and people who might dine out under normal circumstances find themselves ordering in, if they can even find a place to take their order.   The restaurant industry is suffering, like most of the economy. But there will come a day when people will eat out again. And while the landscape will be drastically different, the experience may be strikingly familiar. Once the health crisis subsides, what will it take for restaurants to open their doors?   Jason Bowell is the assistant general manager at the Beatrice Inn, a traditional New York chophouse that prides itself on its innovative yet timeless meat dishes. Bowell has been managing restaurants for about a decade and worked in the restaurant business for the better part of three decades.   “The restaurants that are going to have not as much trouble getting back on their feet are going to be restaurants that are involved with larger chains,” says Bowell. “Restaurants that are able to pivot well enough to create a good enough online delivery business — delivery and takeout business — are at least going to weather the storm a little bit. And people that are savvy enough to understand how to work their way through getting relief from the government. There are loans being offered, especially for restaurants that are keeping people on staff as paid.”   A successful pivot, even if only to tread water in the short-term, is far from assured for most establishments. There are many factors at play.   “Places with high overhead, like large places that would normally really focus in on getting a lot of guests in and turning those guests over, they’ll be struggling pretty bad,” Bowell points out. “If your business model is based on having large groups of people in your place… your costs per square foot is going to be really hard to cover by doing delivery.”   Those costs could be anything from fixed costs like rent on the space to variable costs like electricity and other utilities. Variable costs, of course, drop with decreased usage. Restaurants sharply reduced their labor costs when governments closed dining rooms and eliminated it entirely if they opted for hibernation. After all, as Bowell points out, “the most important difference between a restaurant that’s going to succeed and one that’s not going to succeed is whether or not you can cover your current costs.”   While reducing or eliminating labor costs may bide time in the short-term, those tactics will also make re-opening that much harder when that time finally comes. “I don’t see the point of not employing people, being in business if you can. If you’re not, not only are you going to have a really hard time not completely folding while the restaurants are closed, but also getting yourself back up to speed when you’re actually allowed to start taking people again.”   Having a staff ready to go when the economy opens its doors again could be the difference between a strong comeback and a dismal end. “It’s about staff retention,” Bowell bluntly puts it. “If I retain my staff, I could probably be open in four or five days. And that’s just to make sure that we’re getting all of our product in and that we’re prepping everything and all the things we need to have ready to go for service are ready to go.”   Not retaining staff means using time for hiring and training that might otherwise be spent serving, and making money from, the public. Another potential hurdle is restocking restaurant kitchens with ingredients.   “You’re going to have a lot of people ordering a lot of stuff really quickly,” says Bowell. “And that’s going to cause issues getting product from point A to point B if you’re having huge, massive orders come across your board. Keep in mind, you make those orders for all that food, it’s all perishable. So it’s all about timing. Restaurants are going to have to wait until they’re stocked up, until they’re prepped and then take a day to open. It might be staggered when those restaurants are opening.”   The few restaurants that can stay open, retain staff and ramp up quickly, can expect banner days as all the pent-up demand fills the marketplace. Diners should expect a far different landscape, however, with fewer dining-out options. According to Bowell, “a lot of those places that shouldn’t have been open, that were on the cusp, are going to be closed. So all the restaurants that are still open are going to benefit from that for awhile.”   The in-house dining experience may largely return to what it was before the pandemic, and restaurant scenes everywhere will find some sort of post-coronavirus existence. But Bowell doesn’t see the world returning to the way it was. “I don’t think there’s ever a normal again after this, because this is really rewriting the way all restaurateurs think about their businesses. It’s going to be a different playing field. I think a lot of people learned a lot of lessons about how their businesses run during this thing. It’s going to change the way they run their businesses right now.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.11593690359819392, "subjectivity": 0.5028789430402334, "wordcount": 951}

In tonight’s episode titled “The Arizona” a man seeks to prove he deserves to be laid to rest one day on the USS Arizona alongside his brothers and sisters as a veteran of Pearl Harbor.  CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke with  NCIS ‘ Wilmer Valderrama about tonight’s episode, his time on the show and working with Lloyd.   MW:  Good morning Wilmer, hope all’s well by you!   WV:  All’s good, brother same to you.   MW:  Happy to hear it, so I’m excited for tonight’s new episode of  NCIS   but before we get into tonight, you’ve been on the show for a number of years now but you joined the program at a point where they had already been on the air for 10-plus years. What was it like for you to join such an established show?     WV:  It was fun.  It was fun to join a show that knew itself very well, that understood what was special about itself, which is the characters. The recipe of the show is it cares about really good characters and you really understand them to be human, they make mistakes, they win and lose. To me that’s what’s really special and I had a lot of fun developing my character over the last four years .    The truth is if you do your work, you come prepared, you come to play, you want to be there, it’s quite an exciting time. It’s a lot of fun to be with a group of individuals along with an amazing crew that loves what they do. To me that was the most important thing, to be able to go to a place where people love what they’re doing.     MW:  And you did more than just join the show you’ve become a major part of everything playing Nick Torres. What have you learned about the character over years?     WV:  To be disruptive. To be a character that comes to a show that knows itself and its tone too well for too long, I think your only contribution is to disrupt the peace a little bit. I think that’s the most unique part about joining the show is to develop a character that could really change things up for  the rest of the characters. I think that’s what Torres was meant to do was to really expand the universe of  NCIS  to a whole different spectrum and to create a tonal difference from what was there before to what it is there now.    So that to me was my contribution to the show to create a character that I think people wanted to tune in for. Someone who would light it on fire a little bit. Who would break the door open before he knocks on it, someone who was able to talk back at Gibbs when nobody else does. It was refreshing to play a character that would have the ability to do that.     MW:  What about tonight’s all-new episode, what can you tell us about you have in store for viewers this week?     WV:  I’m stoked about it. This will be an episode that will lead into our hiatus, it’s an emotional episode. We’ll have Christopher Lloyd as our lead guest star and like a little kid I’m freaking out. I’ve seen all of his characters from  Addams Family  to  Back To The Future  to see him as this character that was so raw so real. You’re going to see him preform like you’ve never seen him before. He has a little bit of humor but he’s two-thirds  heart. It’s a very heartfelt story about his character wanting to be put to rest alongside his brothers and sisters inside the USS Arizona.    I don’t know how many people know, if you’re a veteran and you served on one of the ships that retired, you have the ability to join your brothers and sisters in the mass of the ship. So that’s all he wants, he wants to be recognized and laid to rest next his comrades. That’s what the episode is, to make sure he makes it there.     MW:  Awesome. You know a lot of people are in need of a distraction right now and what better way than having yourself and Doc on the same episode. That’s a pretty cool thing.     WV:  Yeah, it’s definitely fun [laughs]. I have some really cool scenes with him too. You’ll see, it’s a really fun episode and its really heart felt. I think  at this time, what we need the most is some inspiration or may be a laugh or two. Tonight will just play on the strings of your heart. This is the episode that reminds us we need to continue celebrating our sullen heroes and look around at the people who are stepping up for you and that’s what this show is about.     MW:  Much needed. Thanks so much for the time today Wilmer and all the best, stay safe out there!   WV:  Thanks, you too man, I appreciate it!     Tune into  NCIS  to watch “The Arizona” tonight at 8:00 PM ET/PT, only on CBS and streaming on  CBS All Access .

(AP) —  A Maryland man who operated an online drug dealing website engaged in extensive plans to bomb and burn down a competing pharmacy in Nebraska, an FBI agent testified Monday.   At a court hearing in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, the agent testified that William Burgamy, 32, of Hanover, Maryland, was getting his supply of drugs from a pharmacist in Nebraska. Under the plan discussed in a journal and text messages, Burgamy and his supplier pharmacist reasoned that if the competing pharmacy were destroyed, Burgamy’s pharmacist would pick up new customers and could then increase his supply to Burgamy without attracting suspicion, authorities said.   “The defendant is a dangerous and volatile individual who schemed to blow up that pharmacy using Molotov cocktails,” prosecutor Raj Parekh said.   During a two-hour detention hearing conducted by conference call, FBI agent Samad Shahrani said that a search of Burgamy’s home found eight loaded weapons in his residence. Text messages showed that he made a list of needed equipment that included body armor, weapons, bottles, lighter fluid and other materials. Last month his pharmacist gave him a map that could be used to plot his getaway after bombing the rival pharmacy, Shahrani testified.   U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff ordered Burgamy to remain in jail pending trial after Monday’s detention hearing.   Public defender Elizabeth Mullin had argued Burgamy should be released pending trial, saying that his talk about firebombing a pharmacy was just hyperbole. She also said pretrial detention should be used sparingly because jails can be a particular risk for spreading the coronavirus.   Burgamy “does not have an unrequited thirst for violence,” Mullin said.   Burgamy was arrested last week on charges of illegal drug distribution and money laundering after prosecutors accused him of selling large-scale quantities of narcotics and other drugs over the internet.   An FBI affidavit states Burgamy operated a business on the Darknet called NeverPressedRX that sold oxycodone and other narcotics over the internet without a prescription.   Court papers do not specify the volume of transactions, but show Burgamy regularly exchanged thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin used in the purchases for U.S. currency.   Burgamy boasted on his vendor page late last month that, “Even with Corona Virus the shop is running at full speed,” according to the affidavit.   Neither the testimony nor the court documents specified the Nebraska town or towns where the pharmacies were located.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

A court heard arguments in the case last week. Several small businesses based in Baltimore sued Bank of America, claiming the bank’s plan to give existing customers priority when assigning funds through the Paycheck Protection Program was unfair.   The program includes nearly $350 billion in funding in the form of government-backed loans for small businesses to cover payroll and other expenses amid the pandemic.

READ MORE: Lawsuit Accuses Bank Of America Of Prioritizing Existing Customers When Doling Out Federal Coronavirus Relief Funds   In a 23-page opinion filed Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher said Congress is better positioned to make changes to the law than the court:   “The Court will not wade into the merits of this debate. Certainly, Plaintiffs’ experiences demonstrate a significant flaw, from their perspective and that of many other small businesses, in the implementation of the massive and complex PPP program. However, given the competing policy interests, the need to balance the desire to assist the widest swath of small businesses with the need to incentivize lender participation, and the overall fluidity of this epidemic, Congress is better positioned to remedy any defects in the CARES Act, and to pass the supplemental legislation it believes best aimed at ameliorating the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.”   Gallagher also wrote that Bank of America’s argument for prioritizing existing customers was “compelling.”     NEW: Judge Gallagher sides with Bank of America and denies the Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.

Hur. “These resources will help support their efforts to promote public safety during this difficult time.”   Funds may be used to hire personnel, pay overtime costs, cover protective equipment and supplies, address correctional inmates’ medical needs and defray expenses related to the distribution of resources to hard-hit areas, among other activities. Grant funds may be applied retroactively to Jan. 20, 2020, subject to federal supplanting rules.   “This is an unprecedented moment in our nation’s history and an especially dangerous one for our front-line law enforcement officers, corrections officials, and public safety professionals,” said Office of Justice Programs Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Katharine T. Sullivan. “We are grateful to the Congress for making these resources available and for the show of support this program represents.”   Agencies that were eligible for the fiscal year 2019 State and Local Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program are candidates for this emergency funding.

The critically acclaimed addition to the  Star Trek  universe releases a new episode every Wednesday through CBS All Access as it continues to wind its way through its inaugural ten-episode season.   CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke with cast mates Michelle Hurd (Raffi) and Isa Briones (Soji/Dahj) to discuss their history with the  Star Trek  franchise before joining the crew and the importance of the show’s message of inclusion for young people.   MW:  Good morning and congrats to both of you for landing on this show and all the success so far. I’m curious, were either of you  Star Trek  fans growing up?   MH:  Yeah,  Star Trek  was always in my family’s house. I’m biracial, my father is black and my mother is white. My father is an actor and it was really important for him that his three daughters could see themselves represented when we watched television.  Star Trek  was actually one of the only shows that was inclusive and one of the only shows that we would watch as a family. It was one of the first times they had a biracial kiss on television. Isa and I, we’re both biracial creatures it’s an honor to carry that torch for the other little munchkins that are out there now, they get to see themselves represented on television. I don’t think I realized as an adult how impactful that show was to my life and to the decisions I’ve made, I’m excited we get to do that to some other little kids.   MW:  That’s great. Isa, what about you?   IB:  Unfortunately, I didn’t watch it as a kid. I was always aware of it. In my household we didn’t watch it but we were always very aware of George Takei, he was obviously a big figure in the Asian American community and for my dad. He would talk about how he didn’t realize that early on he was the only Asian character he saw because growing up he only saw White people and he was like ‘yeah that’s what TV looks like, I’m not going to question it’ but then you realize, wow he was one of the first, he really paved that way. So really amazing to join the same universe as that and continue that legacy and to think of all those little girls out there, all those little mixed kids are going to be like ‘oh my gosh, I can be in space.’   MW:  That’s awesome. Moving into both of your characters, I would love to hear from each of you, in your own words, what are your characters all about…   MH:  Roffi, I adore playing Roffi. She’s a great character one of the best I’ve ever had. She is a security analyst, she’s a hacking genius, but her person, she’s a woman who is struggling with decisions she has made in the past. Things that have happened to her that have haunted her. She’s doing her very best to get up in the morning and greet the day.   Because of these things that are haunting her; she is relying on vices as crutches. I think that’s a great story to tell right now about addiction, which has been part of our society forever. For a period of time it’s been sort of this shameful thing and sometimes you write people off who are addicted to things. You think they are outcast and what I love and what is important for us to remember are people who have addictions those are demons that are their shoulders. They’re doing their very best to try to greet the day and they’re still valuable, they’re still contributes to our society. We should reach out, look out and help them. I think given this opportunity to play Roffi and tell that story under the awning of sci-fi is phenomenal because we could really explore what that means. I’m excited to play a character so perfectly imperfect.   IB:  I play Dahj and Soji as you’ve seen now, but you’re going to see a lot more of Soji coming up. It’s really exciting because you get to see a young woman dealing with trauma and struggling with her identity. For me it touches my heart that I get to portray that when I know being mixed, racial identity can really be hard to wrap your head around when you are younger and figure out where you belong and I think that’s exactly what Soji is going through. She’s figuring out these two parts of her, she’s lived her life human, now she’s finding out she’s something else. There’s so much at play and coming to terms with those two truths and deciding for yourself who you are and not what other people tell you or make you believe but trusting yourself is really beautiful.   MW:  Great. Last question before I let you go and thank you both so much for taking the time to speak with me. If each of you could describe the series in one word, I know it’s putting you on the spot a little bit, but one word for each you to describe the series, what would you choose?   MH:  Hope.   IB:  Timely.   MW:  Perfect. Thank you so much to each of you for giving me the time today and all the best moving forward!   MH:  Thanks Matt.   IB:  Thank you have a good one!

As the name suggests, the latest chapter of the  Star Trek  anthology focuses on the legendary Captain Picard portrayed by Sir Patrick Stewart.  Picard  picks up years after the good captain’s departure from Star Fleet with an all-new outlook on life.   In order to understand the events that lead to the show’s opening episode one needs only to look towards the work of acclaimed  Star Trek  author Una McCormack’s latest novel,  Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope . CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke to McCormack to discuss her latest book and the path that took her from writing fan fiction to legitimately adding to the  Star   Trek  universe.   MW:  First off, I just want to know, where did your love of  Star Trek  begin? It’s a big part of your life. Where did it all begin for you, your earliest memories?     UM:  I think most people my age in the States were watching it in syndication. Of course ,  I’m in Britain so we didn’t get the original show until the late 70s. My first introduction was  with  the movies in the 80s. I was a teenager and they were brilliant. Then the  Next Generation  started  and couldn’t get them in Britain so  I got them at Blockbuster and rented them out two  episodes  at a time. I was about 16 or 17, really excited to get to see them and obviously reading the novels at the same time.    I really got into it as a teenager, but not with the original  Trek , it was that cast and the movies ,  The Next Generation  with Patrick Stewart playing Captain Picard, so same sort of age but different rooting.     MW:  Do you just pinch yourself now that you get to add to the  Star Trek  universe the way that you do?     UM:  Yeah, it’s  absolutely  incredible.  I’ve written a lot of books with  Star Trek  being more than half of them, but the show has been off the air for most of the time I’ve been doing those novels which has its own fun. To work right alongside a show like this it’s coming on air, it’s really exciting, a lot of people are really interested in it. Picard is such a cultural icon, it’s an absolutely brilliant dream come true.     MW:  Awesome. What was your  initial   reaction when you heard that Picard was returning with his own series?     UM:  My initial reaction was ‘ooh I hope I get to  write  a book.’  [laughs]     I was really excited, wondering where are they going to take this. The team around it  is just so brilliant.  After what they’ve done with this, it’s going to be worth seeing. Even  if I wasn’t involved in this in any way ,  I would’ve been really excited for the show, just to see what they were going to do with it  and this team of writers in particular.     MW:  Have you actually met Sir Patrick before?     UM:  Oh, I’ve never met him. I’ve been at a convention hall and he was sort of on the other side of it. So that’s probably  the closest I’ve ever got, no.     MW:  Oh no, we have to  work on that for you.     UM:  Oh yeah, I would love to!   MW:   The   Last Best Hope  actually ties directly into the All Access series, can you share how exactly the book fits in and what fans can expect?     UM:  Absolutely, so if you watch the show now, it’s a prequel novel. It’s set about  14-15 years before the action of the show, so we see what leads up to Picard leaving Starfleet.  I don’t want to spoil the plot. The Picard we meet at the start of that is much closer to the one that we remember from all those years ago. We see the events that sort of lead u p to Picard being the man that he is at the start of the current show. We meet a few other characters that we know already ,  Geordi  La   Forge but  also,  we meet some people from the new show. So ,  they’ll read more about  J u rat i  or about Raffi . There’s also a  lot  of new characters there that we ma k e up for the book, telling  their  stories.    So,  it’s a prequel novel, leans back  in to the old show,  but also  gives a kind of background, further  exploration  of people and settings of the new show. People will see the  Elnor  and the  Qowat  Milat .  So,  lots, lots to sort of see back in the old show and  feed  into the current  viewing .  Which I don’t think spoils the plot.     MW:  I’m curious   when you’re writing these books, they’re your ideas but they are part of a much bigger universe that has a lot of hands in it. How much freedom do you have when you’re writing these books to put in your own ideas versus how much of it is collaborative?   UM:  The show is really high profile and people working on it are really vested in it. I work really closely with  Kirsten   Beyer  in the  writer’s   room,  so we were really working on what’s the story we really want to tell that’s really going to serve the show and serve the book as well. We were reading scripts as they were coming in and being rewritten, but that’s part of what you do with a job like this you write about parts, filling in parts. It’s really enjoyable. I really like it.   I’ve done this job for 15 years or so and I write fan fiction for  pleasure,  so I love filling in these little corners that we haven’t explored. I’ll watch something on screen and wonder what’s the story behind that or something leading up to that, exactly the kind of thing this book can explore, I just really love that. I love spending more time with characters I love off TV shows or novels that I’ve read. I think Michael  Chabon  talks about fan fiction and  how he sees it deep in the show; his version of Trek fever and things like that. It’s all really good fun. I never see it as a lack of freedom, I see it as a process of me getting to enrich my own appreciation of something.     MW:  I’m glad you brought up the fan fiction. That will be the last question for you here today and we will kind of end at the beginning in a way. You started writing fan fiction and that’s how you got discovered. What was that like going from writing fan fiction to where you are now? Also, what advice do you have for other aspiring people out there who are writing fan fiction who want to get to the levels that you are at?     UM:  I was doing it for fun, and someone said would you like to be commissioned to do this. I think I was very lucky. I was commissioned for a  Deep Space 9  novel and it was off the air, so it was a bit easier to break into it. This was back in the late 90s so, there wasn’t as much fan fiction online, it was a bit easier to get noticed.    I would say to people, there aren’t that many slots for these kinds of books these days. I would say that the best routine is to be writing your own new stuff and get that published and get that out. Then get an agent and express interest in books or series being done at the moment. It’s good for people to see you have a track record of these kind of things. It’s sound like saying you need the experience to get the job but if you can show you can do it that goes a long way  because often you have to train to the story because a new script is coming or you need to be prepared to alter things quite close to a deadline. You have to show that you’re quite good at coping with deadlines and be able to change or finesse a story.    So ,  the way to get into  these kinds of things  is to write and to write as much as possible, send your stuff out and hopefully a gig like this will come and it will be huge fun for people too.     MW:  Very valuable insight from someone as accomplished as yourself.  Thank you for speaking with me Una and all the best moving forward!   UM:  Very kind.  Same to you Matt!

Typically around this time of year, accountants are frantically trying to make the April 15 tax filing deadline. Even though that deadline has been extended to July 15 this year, they’re still busy now, helping clients navigate the challenging economic crisis caused by COVID-19.   “We have a number of clients who are in the ‘essential’ business category who are still up and running, but their primary concern aside from the health and well being of their team (is) will they ultimately get paid?” Jeff Rosen, co-managing partner of accounting firm RS&F, said.   Accountants are trying to accommodate small business owners who are increasingly turning to them seeking guidance about loans and other options.

Many small business owners across the country are racing to secure their portion of the $349 billion made available by the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created as part of the coronavirus stimulus package officially known as the CARES Act.   The money is available to qualifying small businesses to help them survive the pandemic, but it hasn’t been all smooth sailing.   READ MORE: Md.

She’s my best friend.’ ”   After helping his grandma, the boy with the big smile and bigger heart looked at his grandmother’s neighbors at her senior citizen home — and worried.   “He was so heartbroken that he didn’t have enough to give to everyone,” Llacey Simmons, Bell’s mom, told CNN.   So Bell used $600 he’d saved up to fund his first batch of care packages.   “I asked him how much money he wanted to use from his savings– $50 or $100? He’s like ‘let’s use all of it.’ ”   Bell assembled more than 100 care packages and hot meals to deliver.   “We got stacks … we got hygeine products, and we got toilet paper,” Bell said.   The community joins in   When news spread of the first-grader’s good deed, donations began to roll in. He has since started an online campaign to get through what he calls the “coronapocalypse.”   It’s become more of a community project that way. But only Bell and his mother make the deliveries.   “We aren’t allowed to gather in large groups,” the supportive mom shared.   And with an overflow of donations, Simmons and Bell have created a community care pantry in Gaithersburg.   “Hopefully we can help a thousand people. We plan to do this until we run out of donations or until the pandemic is over,” Simmons said,   “It makes me feel beautiful inside because I like giving back,” Bell said.

(WJZ) —  Starting Wednesday, all retail shoppers and employees in Anne Arundel County will be required to wear face coverings in stores.  “Our most effective tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is for each of us to act as though we are carriers of the virus, because we could be,” said County Executive Steuart Pittman. “Face coverings in retail businesses by both shoppers and staff will save lives.

Face coverings may be made out of cloth and don’t have to be surgical-grade masks such as N95 masks, which officials said should be for health workers.   “Masks protect you and those around you,” Kalyanaraman, who signed the order Tuesday morning, said. “It’s an important way each of us can slow the spread of the virus.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The order also requires retail businesses allowed open as essential to limit customer capacity to 50 percent of the normal capacity, maintain six feet between customers at checkout lines, make aisles one-way whenever possible, clearly mark social distancing restrictions, discontinue all self-service food counters, install physical barriers between cashiers and customers and provide access to sanitary restrooms and soap or hand sanitizer for customers and workers.

(WJZ) —  Maryland school officials are asking local districts to finalize their plans for distance learning as they wait to make a decision about schools closing through the academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  They did not make any official decisions about schools closing on the teleconference Tuesday.   Maryland schools will receive $207 million from the U.S. Department of Education to help pay for expenses and programs during the pandemic.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus List: Top 20 Zip Code In Maryland Reporting COVID-19 Cases   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     State school superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon said 90% of the money will be used to pay for expenses schools have incurred since March 13, 2020, when schools closed in the state.   The state will work with local school systems to make sure funds are dispersed as needed.   “To ensure we have a level of consistency in the continuity of plans for each local school system” their plans must be submitted for approval,” she said. “That [plan] must include their distance learning platform, the technology they have available and how the students who don’t have access to the device or the internet” will learn.   The plans will also describe the roles and responsibilities of school administrators, instructional assistants, students, and parents.   “They have to include a sample teacher and student day, a plan of accountability is to be included and should identify how they will monitor and access student performance,” Salmon added.   They must also describe how their school system plans to address equity, including special education, English learners, homeless students, students with academic needs and gifted students. They must also determine how teachers and staff will continue professional development and what resources will be available to students and teachers.   The school district has laid out some overall guidance and plans on their website along with some tips on how to help students in rural or low-income communities access the internet.   For example, in Cecil County, they are buying TMobile hotspots and putting them on buses. They are then driving the buses into areas with limited coverage.   Some school systems are sending packages with postage paid so they can be returned to teachers, the state said. Others are allowing students to park outside the schools and use that as a hotspot.   Schools also reviewed how they will handle things like graduation credits, attendance and more and put that in an FAQ on the state  schools’ website.    Maryland   Also, schools will continue to provide meals to students in the interim. Salmon said hundreds of thousands of meals have been served to children so far.   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Park Heights is among the zip code 21215  with the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state.   Rashad Singletary is the Manager for Safe Streets Baltimore.

Before walking throughout the neighborhood, he glances at the people sitting too close to each other at the bus stop.   “We’re trying to stop THAT,” he says with a furrowed brow.   “We’re maintaining our social distancing to make sure we don’t get infected or we infect someone else in case somebody does have it. What we’re doing is canvassing the hot spots in our community, or our target area.”   As the group of five walks along Belvedere Avenue, they walk side by side knowing there’s much more work to be done, but it’s a challenge they’re willing to take on.   Jarma Henson is also in the group.   “We just try to go out and deal with different ways of dealing with violence and let them know you don’t always have to deal with situations with violence.”   Another team on the front lines when Baltimore needs it now more than ever.

Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. submitted the budget on Tuesday to the County Council, it reflects an approximately $40 million write-down from earlier revenue estimates according to the county, a side effect from the growing coronavirus pandemic.   “This is not the budget I hoped to present, but it is the one that meets the moment. We are laser-focused on responding to the immediate needs of this crisis even as we prepare our County for the long-term economic recovery.” Olszewski said. “We will get through this together, continuing to build toward our vision for a better Baltimore County for us all.”   The proposed education budget is more than $2 billion, county government officials said, with the proposed Baltimore County Public Schools budget at nearly $36 million above FY20 funding levels and $20 million over Maintenance of Effort, providing a one percent cost-of-living increase for all BCPS employees starting July 1.   It also is proposing more than $1 million to spend on hiring more school counselors and staff to address mental health for students, and funding for tech and early college high school programs for Dundalk High School and Woodlawn High School respectively.   There are also funds being proposed to be set aside for a real time crime center in the county, firefighter gear and Police Athletic League Center funding through the Department of Recreation and Parks.   A two percent cost-of-living increase for all County employees is included in the budget as well, which would increase on June 30. It also provides funds for a Towson Circulator pilot program, funding to resume glass recycling and adds $1 million to support volunteer fire companies.   And for those who love parks- it would provide new funding for buying land for new parks and a more “equitable distribution of park and recreational infrastructure,”   The County Council is scheduled to vote on the budget on May 21.

The site is still operating on an appointment-only model and patients must have a referral to make an appointment.   When it comes to opening future testing sites, Dzirasa said the city is using recently-released demographic and racial data to determine where the next sites should be, adding officials have scouted sites in both west and east Baltimore.

Congress passed the CARES Act in late March to give direct economic relief to individuals and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic, as it devastates the U.S. economy.   However, the CARES Act does not explicitly designate the emergency stimulus payments exempt from garnishment from creditors, the attorney general said in a press release Monday.   He has joined a coalition of 25 other attorneys general calling to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to protect the CARES Act funds, and ensure they are protected from wage garnishment.

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao announced that 18 of the state’s airports will get $107,731,471 in funding. Nationwide, airports will get $10 billion as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act, also known as the coronavirus stimulus program.   “This $10 billion in emergency resources will help fund the continued operations of our nation’s airports during this crisis and save workers’ jobs,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is among the state’s airports to get funding, and the “easy come, easy go” airport is now too easy.   “This virus is…so sneaky,” said BWI Executive Director Ricky Smith. “It’s so unpredictable.”   And, the airport is too eerie.   “It’s been kinda slow,” said custodian Herman Merderth.   WJZ Reporter: “Kinda?”   “Yeah, real slow,” Merderth chuckled.   Since the governor’s executive order nearly a month ago, the TSA reports passengers are down more than 90 percent.   “It’s a good sign that people are staying safe. People are staying home,” Smith said.   Airlines have all changed the way they operate during the pandemic. Southwest Airlines stopped its drink and snack service three weeks ago and said they’re using hospital grade disinfectant throughout their fleet. Jet Blue has temporarily suspended its service at BWI.   “We have a lot of dedicated people who are still here working,” Smith said.   About 80 of the airport’s businesses are closed.   Passengers, these days, are looking a lot like Bobbi Bloom, a traveling nurse.   She flew in Tuesday from Las Vegas.   “There’s only five of us on my plane. It’s very, very empty in there,” Bloom said.   “It’s definitely a little weird seeing empty planes and not having them filled,” said student London Hershey.   “We talked a lot about social distancing and how to make sure to stay safe,” said her mom, Erin Hershey.   Social distancing is written on the signs.   “Touch points, railings, elevator buttons. They’re cleaning those things multiple times a day,” Smith said.   Despite the drop in traffic, the airport has actually increased its sanitation.   “It’s scary because I’m 65 years old, and in my 65 years, I’ve never seen nothing like this,” Merderth said.   The airport is used to 50,000 to 60,000 passengers a day, but is now down to as low as 1,300 a day now.     The funding is meant to help airports continue operations and replace lost revenue stemming from a lack of travel and other airport business due to the public health emergency, including airport capital expenditures, operating expenses including payroll and utilities, as well as debt payments.

Marylanders have been practicing social distancing for about a month now, and while many agree it’s important, some say it’s been taking a toll.   “Being stuck inside all day is kind of dreary,” Madeline Napier, a Baltimore resident, said.   “Work has been kind of challenging getting used to because of the social distancing online,” Nick Chomp, of Locust Point, said.   “I just really hope it doesn’t drag into the summer,” Brian Deiienno, of Federal Hill, said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Dr. Jason Farley, a Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said a return to the days of normalcy will come gradually.   “We will not be flipping a light switch and all returning to normal life,” he said. “This is going to be a gradual rolling back of the restrictions.”   It could take months, and ultimately, a vaccine is needed.   “That vaccine is 12 to 18 months away, but the testing for antibodies and the possible therapeutic of that drug that might work is a much shorter timeline,” Farley said.   Farley said more testing is needed and more research has to be done on antibodies testing. It could determine if an infected person who recovered has developed immunity.   “That antibody year is what’s so critical and important because if we’ve recovered from the infection we ultimately could probably begin going back to our lives,” Farley said.   Farley told WJZ that Johns Hopkins is estimating that social distancing will last at least into May, but they’re also thinking about timelines that last into June or July, and even then, it would still be a gradual rollback on restrictions.

(CBS Local)  — As the coronavirus pandemic limits social contact with others, gyms and exercise studios have been forced to close, leaving members looking for alternative ways to get in their regular workouts. Thankfully, social media and live video technology is allowing trainers to stay close to members from a distance and give individuals ideas for at-home workouts.  In Edina, Minnesota,  Barre3 studio  is offering classes in real time on Instagram Live. Now their $24 classes are free of charge to anyone in need. “It wouldn’t feel right to exclude these live classes from anyone and everyone who wants to join in on them,” co-owner Lucy Gardiner told CBS Minnesota.   Similarly, Chris Vlaun, co-founder of  V. Art of Wellness  based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, teaches a free, 10-minute, full-body workout on his Instagram page. If you do three rounds of it, you can extend your workouts to 30 minutes. “Ten minutes on Instagram is way to connect with people,” he told CBS Miami. “It’s a quick warm up and then intensified. It’s a full-body experience and there is no equipment necessary.”   At Local Motion  Fitness in Pittsburgh , owner Laura Fonzi has created an exercise  class  for kids everyday on her Facebook page,  Local Motion PGH . “As a mom of four, I know our kids need exercise for their mental health now that their schedules are disrupted,”  she told CBS PIttsburgh .   One company in particular is bringing a wide range of health clubs from around the country to its members, giving new meaning to the term “group fitness.” Hundreds of gyms and studios have partnered with Pikesville, Maryland-based  BurnAlong  to get their workouts online and give Americans the ability to work out in real-time along with trainers and gym rats near and far.   BurnAlong helps people stay healthy and engaged with their favorite instructor from home. The online fitness and wellbeing platform brings exercise, yoga, meditation, and other health-centric classes to digital devices, partnering with fitness clubs and trainers to allow members the opportunity to get their fix anywhere, anytime. Over the past month, more than 150 new gyms and studios have signed up with BurnAlong, Co-Chief Executive Daniel Freedman told CBS Local.   “It’s clear people are feeling both the stress of being stuck at home and the concern for jobs, economy, and their health — and are gravitating towards emotional health classes along with classes for their physical health, and taking classes live with others for social support,” he said.   Freedman says because of the restraints of social distancing, a record number of companies are signing up for their employees. “Employers and insurers are understanding that they have a responsibility to support employees during this difficult time by both delivering to them the physical and emotional health classes they need, and, importantly, their families need too,” he said.     Great way for family to start day – live class from  @MonteSanders  on  @BurnAlong  .  (1,000s of classes, 45+ categories, 100s of local instructors.) Keep healthy, keep positive, keep active – so impt during these times.  #fitness   #Health   #exercise   #Motivation   #coronavirus   #wellness   pic.twitter.com/Alyq0ZhpOr   — Daniel Freedman (@dfreed1)  March 20, 2020         The number of classes taken by BurnAlong members has grown seven-fold since March, and more than 25 percent of the classes taken fall into the specialty and emotional support categories.  The increase cuts across all age groups, ranging from 6 weeks — with parents in particular rushing to fill time in “Mommy and Me” classes — to those in their 90s. In fact, the oldest active member is 97 years old.   Freedman said members are especially spending more time tending to their mental health these days. The number of yoga and meditation classes taken has doubled since the beginning of the nationwide stay-at-home recommendations. “We are living in a time of lots of unknowns and that’s scary. Yoga, mindfulness, and meditation helps put those out of the mind and lets people relax,” he said.   For people who do prefer to exercise in a live group setting, BurnAlong includes a class where members can invite up to three friends, family members or co-workers to take group classes together in real time where they can see and hear each other.   “When we ask people what they love most about BurnAlong that’s keeping them so engaged, they say it’s the range of programming – classes for the whole family – and critically the social component, of being able to take classes live online in private sessions with friends, family members, co-workers you see,” said Freedman. “People are craving social support now more than ever.”   Looking ahead into what life will be like once the outbreak ends and life resumes for Americans, Freedman believes that health clubs will need to adapt to the fact that people will be more prone to working out from home. Whether it’s because we’ve simply grown used to this new normal, or because people will feel safer and healthier at home, the need on-demand fitness likely won’t fade. “Post-COVID, with fitness as with work, I think we will see more of a hybrid model. People will be more comfortable than before exercising from home, but will still crave in-person experiences,” he said. “So the key for brick and mortar is to make sure people can easily transition between online and in-person, similar to the sports and music industries.”   As for some other online exercise options:   Amy Segal is a Miami-based flywheel  fitness  trainer under her Instagram name  @Spinmoma  or #amyspin. These days Segal is burning calories and having loads fun off the bike from outside her home with as many  fitness  friends and fans as she can fit on her daily free Zoom  classes .

It all happened so quickly and I said I don’t know. She said find out and figure it out because that’s very important in terms of where we go with this.

And for the sports-deprived fan, it can’t come fast enough. The world remains in full-on lock-down mode thanks to coronavirus. Basketball and hockey are on seemingly permanent pause. Baseball never really started. Football fans can’t even follow the  XFL , which played half a season 19 years after its first and disappeared again like some sort of sports league cicada.  The three-day NFL Draft is probably the closest to live sports we’re going to get for awhile. Or maybe not…   CBS Sports, in partnership with the NFL, has updated its schedule to broadcast 15 of this century’s classic NFL games leading into next week’s Draft. Among them are Super Bowls, Championships and regular season games, featuring some of the game’s greats and bright young stars. See Tom Brady take on Peyton Manning and Patrick Mahomes face down Lamar Jackson.   The re-airings are scheduled to start Thursday, April 16 on CBS Sports Network with the 2019 Week 3 matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes got the better of Jackson that wet afternoon, as the Ravens eked out a 33-28 win. The re-broadcasts will continue through the weekend when Manning leads his Indianapolis Colts past Brady’s New England Patriots in the 2006 AFC Championship and into Super Bowl XLI and then does it again with the Denver Broncos in the 2015 AFC Championship for a trip to Super Bowl 50.

In Anne Arundel County, an order requiring employees and shoppers to wear face coverings while in stores went into effect Wednesday.

However, it’s the worst time to be a sports fan. With coronavirus and the subsequent social distancing, all in-season sports have gone on hiatus. All out-of-season sports — namely football — have gone remote for all off-season activities.  MLB is exploring options for a properly distanced baseball, for which teams, umpires and relevant staff would isolate themselves, perhaps in Arizona, for a shortened, fan-free regular season. The NFL is still planning for a 16-game regular season in the fall. But is there a way to be safe and still play ball?   Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the country’s top infectious disease expert, believes there is. When asked by Snapchat’s Peter Hamby about the chances of baseball resuming this summer and college football and the pro football following in August, Fauci seemed open to the possibility.   “There’s a way of doing that,” Fauci said. “Nobody comes to the stadium. Put [players and coaches] in big hotels, wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled. But have them tested like every week and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out.”   Fauci has more pressing matters to attend to, with the country in the throes of the worst pandemic its seen in generations. However he did admit to missing baseball.   “I mean, people say, well you can’t play without spectators. Well, I think you’ll probably get enough buy-in from people who are dying to see a baseball game. Particularly me,” Dr. Fauci said. “I’m living in Washington, we have the world-champion Washington Nationals, you know? I want to see them play again.”   MLB’s reported plan, still in the formulation process, would both keep out fans and protect the health of all involved. Arizona’s governor Doug Ducey would  support hosting games . As Ducey said, “I just want everyone to know that Arizona, at the right time, is very open-minded to hosting whatever Major League Baseball would like from the state, at the time that it would be appropriate for public health if Arizona were in a position to reopen.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.06769047619047619, "subjectivity": 0.4005871998371999, "wordcount": 385}

There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now and there is clearly a light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us. Right now while our numbers are still climbing and we are still heading up that curve, not down, it is absolutely critical for Marylanders to stay home, to continue avoiding crowds and gatherings, and to aggressively practice social distancing.”   Gov. Hogan laid out four building blocks for a recovery plan:     Expanding testing capacity   Increasing hospital surge capacity   Ramping up supply of PPE   Building a robust contact tracing operation     The number of state workers handling Maryland’s contact tracing operation will quadruple—from 250 to 1,000.

Mart to Taser a man who wore a face covering while shopping for groceries earlier this month.  According to The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the man of Tunisian heritage is a healthcare worker who worked with COVID-19 positive patients.   When he entered the store on April 4, a security guard approached him and asked him to remove his face covering. The shopper removed the face covering to show the guard who he was, a regular customer that’s known to the store, then replaced the mask. He also asked the guard to move back so they could follow social distancing guidelines, CAIR says.

The shopper declined saying he had the right to protect himself and other shoppers and proceeding to continue to get groceries.   When the man got to the checkout counter to pay for his items, the security guard again allegedly confronted him and Tasered him as the man stepped away to leave.   When the shopper fell down in shock and pain, the guard allegedly pinned him down and restrained him and then escorted him to an enclosed office space.   Police were called as well as the paramedics and the man was evaluated and cleared for release.   “This individual is a hero providing an essential service during this pandemic, yet he was disrespected, attacked and humiliated as if he were a criminal. This ordeal has traumatized him and has had a profound effect on his wife and children,” said CAIR’s Director of Maryland Outreach Zainab Chaudry. “His experience underscores why too many people of color are uncomfortable or reluctant to wear personal protective gear like face masks in public for fear of being profiled and attacked. We urge law enforcement to promptly investigate the circumstances of this incident, restore some measure of dignity, and help deliver justice for him and his family.”   “This incident is carved in my mind,” the shopper said in a statement provided by CAIR. “[I am] still waking up in the middle of the night with nightmares screaming and crying. My family noticed the change in my behavior also. My daughter and my son are still crying and my daughter was crying in my arms yesterday saying, ‘I want my Dad back’. All I want from this horrifying incident is justice for me and my family. All I want is that after me nobody and no human being should go through what I went through.”   CAIR notes that there have been other incidents where people have been harassed while wearing a face mask in public.   “Our client was violently attacked for simply trying to protect himself and the public from the coronavirus,” said Attorney David Muncy of Plaxen and Adler Law Firm, who is providing legal representation. “The actions of the L.A. Mart guard were reprehensible and cannot be tolerated. We will fight to obtain justice for him and his family and look forward to holding this company responsible for the harm they have caused.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Plans are still developing — pandemics only afford so much certainty —  but pieces are falling into place.  The  schedule shuffle  started in early April, when governing bodies announced new dates for three of the majors. The PGA Championship moved from May to August 3-9. What was supposed to be the season’s second major became the season’s first but will still be played at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, California. The U.S. Open, now September 14-20, became the season’s second major. Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York remains the host. The Masters, at Augusta National, as always, moved to November 9-15. The  Open Championship , pro golf’s fourth major, was cancelled for 2020.   FedExCup Playoff dates, including the  BMW Championship , also moved back, but only by a week. And a report surfaced today that the PGA Tour is planning to return with the  Charles Schwab Challenge  on June 11. Fans won’t be allowed to attend events early in golf’s return, and it remains unclear when they will be allowed.   The Charles Schwab is almost two months away, and a lot can happen between now and then. In the meantime, golf fans can still get their golf fix as CBS Sports re-airs select final rounds of the originally scheduled event, along with PGA Tour specials. Some of the previous winners will discuss their wins via Zoom as we re-live them at home.   It all starts — returns — with the final round of the 2016 RBC Heritage this Saturday on CBS. On that Sunday four years ago, Branden Grace fended off Luke Donald and Russell Knox with a final-round 66 to win his first Tour title. A day forward and a year back, this Sunday CBS will rebroadcast Jim Furyk’s final round at the 2015 RBC Heritage.   In the weeks to come, CBS will return to classic final rounds at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, the Wells Fargo Championship and the AT&T Byron Nelson.   Below is the complete schedule on CBS:   RBC Heritage     2016 Final Round – Saturday, April 18, 3:00 – 6:00 pm   2015 Final Round – Sunday, April 19,  3:00 – 6:00 pm     Zurich Classic of New Orleans     2017 Final Round – Saturday, April 25, 3:00 – 6:00 pm   2019 Final Round – Sunday, April 26,  3:00 – 6:00 pm     Wells Fargo Championship     2015 Final Round – Saturday, May 2, 3:00 – 6:00 pm   2018 Final Round – Sunday, May 3,  3:00 – 6:00 pm     AT&T Byron Nelson     2016 Final Round – Saturday, May 9, 3:00 – 6:00 pm   2017 Final Round – Sunday, May 10,  3:00 – 6:00 pm                                      ", "sentiment": 0.02342052601486562, "subjectivity": 0.5019153802172668, "wordcount": 458}

(WJZ) —  Four recently-admitted residents at a Baltimore County nursing home have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Tuesday.  All four people were admitted to Stella Maris in Timonium, a spokesperson for the facility said. They were all admitted “directly into a dedicated COVID-19 unit, which is separate from the rest of the building and has a dedicated staff of healthcare professionals,” the facility said in a statement.   The spokesperson did not provide further updates citing a policy to not discuss specific patients, but WJZ has learned all four are Jesuit priests who were evacuated from an infirmary in the Philadelphia area.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Rebecca Cook said her mother is a 93-year-old resident at Stella Maris and was shocked to hear the news.   “It’s unbelievable,” Cook said. “I don’t understand why they would do something like that.”   Cook said she got a letter from the facility. The letter said, over the weekend, the priests were treated as persons under investigation. They tested positive for coronavirus and were admitted to a designated COVID-19 unit.   In a statement to WJZ, the nursing home said they’re taking precautionary steps to stop the spread of the virus, like screening staff members upon entry, not allowing any visitors or non essential personal and cancelling all group activities within the facility.   Cook, however, said since there hadn’t been any positive cases on campus, she questions why the nursing facility brought them here in the first place.   “It’s one thing if they were in state, but these people are coming from Philadelphia, so they have places in Philadelphia,” Cook said. “They have hospitals, they have places set up to take people like this.”   John Schweitzer told WJZ his parents are in an independent living hall at Stella Maris. He said he’s upset by the decision the facility made.   “I already can’t see my parents,” he said. “They are 93. Now, they brought the disease to this building, and I don’t think it’s fair.”   The facility does have what’s called a Certificate of Need from Governor Larry Hogan’s office. It designates the facility to create an 18 bed unit for coronavirus patients – that includes residents that become sick or patients who were released from the hospital and need extra care.   Stella Maris said in a letter to family members that “the decision to accept the priest was not made lightly and is in keeping with our Mission to care for the sick and the elderly.”   One employee at Stella Maris, who did not want to be identified, said he’s comfortable with going to work.   “I think we are doing a great job,” the employee said. “We have really been trying to cut down on the people coming into the facility, which is good, and everybody who comes in has their temperature checked.”   Nursing homes have been hit especially hard in Maryland and elsewhere; 24 residents of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy have died and dozens more residents and staff members have tested positive.   There are confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 90 or more nursing home and long-term care facilities in the state, health officials said.   The significant spread of the virus within enclosed communities led Gov. Larry Hogan  to announce the creation of “strike teams”  to bolster facilities’ abilities to respond to the pandemic.

Larry Hogan has signed an executive order that will require all Marylanders to wear face coverings while in stores and on public transportation to limit the spread of COVID-19, and gave an update on strike teams at Maryland facilities and PPE equipment in a press conference on Wednesday.  The order will go into effect on Saturday at 7 a.m., the governor said. All essential business workers must also require their staff to wear face coverings and put into place appropriate social distancing measures in order to keep the customers and their own employees safe.   This includes when people are dealing with Uber, Lyft drivers or delivery workers, all of whom must wear a face covering when near a customer.     Uber and Lyft drivers need to wear face coverings if customers are in the car. Delivery people need to wear face coverings when interacting with customers.   — Mike Ricci (@riccimike)  April 15, 2020     This comes just minutes after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young announced he signed an executive order advising Baltimore residents to wear face coverings out in public.   Other jurisdictions across the state have already made face masks mandatory, including Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County and Montgomery County.   The governor said that according to early projections from Johns Hopkins, without the state taking the drastic actions they have already, the pandemic would infect nearly 360,000 in the state and potentially kill 12,000 Marylanders by June 1.   He said that at this point, the state’s hospitalization rates have started to show signs of stabilizing and they expect their testing capability to continue to ramp up, saying that they are on track to more than triple their current capacity to up to 10,000 tests a day.   “The state has recently secured an additional 40,000 tests, including 30,000 that will be utilized that will utilize the state’s new Abbott m 2000 testing machines,” He said.   These state tests will complement the testing that is happening in clinical facilities and private commercial labs across the state.   Maryland has also entered into a separate agreement with Abbott Labs to acquire a “substantial number” of antibody tests.   The governor said they are also ramping up their supply of PPE, headed by a multi-agency task force, and that they have received one million face shields and 1,000 ICU beds, and in the next week expect deliveries of 4.5 million additional N95 masks, 280 oxygen concentrators and 52 additional ICU ventilators.   In a move that was the first in the nation, there are now strike teams at 16 nursing homes and 15 group homes for medically fragile children.   And, in signs of what he’s calling cautious optimism, he said they are developing a roadmap for the reopening of the state- but clarified that wouldn’t necessarily be happening any time soon.   “Because if the recovery is not in a thoughtful and responsible way, it would not only cost lives, but it would deepen the economic crisis and actually prolong the problems and slow our economy,” Gov. Hogan said.   “There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now. And there is clearly a light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us right now while our numbers are still climbing. And while we’re still heading up that curve. Instead of down. It is absolutely critical for Marylanders to stay at home to continue avoiding crowds and gatherings, and to aggressively practice, social distancing.” He added.

The 21215 zip code has the highest number of cases in Maryland.   Baltimore Mayor Jack Young said of the cases at the facility in the 4800 block of Seton Drive, 129 are residents and 41 are staff members.   “We were very concerned about that,” Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott said.   Scott added that he wants patients inside to know they’re working to keep them safe.   “We have to communicate with the population to make sure they know we’re keeping them informed and healthy and safe and alive,” Scott said. “Everybody has to be communicated with consistently, especially the most vulnerable.”   Coronavirus Latest: More Than 10K COVID-19 Cases Reported In Maryland, 349 Deaths On Record   FutureCare proactively implemented a process known as ‘widespread surveillance testing’ at that Lochearn site, which monitors the intensity and spread of the disease in a community with high transmission.

Hall (@katadhall)  April 15, 2020     “Many of the people who have tested positive are not symptomatic, but this proactive testing allows the medical staff to monitor, and also isolate positive patients,” the city said in a statement.   “The Baltimore City Health Department is aware of the confirmed COVID-19 cases at the FutureCare – Lochearn location, and is working diligently with FutureCare management,” Young said. “I have spoken with Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa, and will continue to monitor the situation at this facility.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus List: Top 20 Zip Code In Maryland Reporting COVID-19 Cases   Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We will continue to provide additional support as needed to help FutureCare support its patients and staff,” Dr. Dzirasa said.   The Baltimore City Health Department is working closely with the Maryland Department of Health, LifeBridge Health, and Johns Hopkins to address the positive cases at the facility.   The following actions have taken place to slow the spread:     In conjunction with the Baltimore City Health Department, the Maryland Department of Health dispatched one of the State’s Strike Teams for Nursing Homes to the facility. The team is composed of members of the National Guard, representatives of local and state health departments, and EMS clinicians, as well as doctors and nurses from local hospital systems.   Baltimore City Health Department distributed personal protective equipment (PPE) from the Strategic National Stockpile and from the Maryland Department of Health’s PPE cache.   The State worked with the Baltimore City Health Department to conduct a site assessment, and helped coordinate efforts with LifeBridge Health and Johns Hopkins.   LifeBridge Health worked with FutureCare to test all of the residents and staff on site, and provided PPE.   LifeBridge sent a medical survey team to provide recommendations to FutureCare management and to assist in establishing medical protocols.     “Our Lochearn facility cares for an elderly population with underlying conditions in the highest COVID-19 impacted zip code in the city, 21215. Therefore, we sought to be the first company to proactively implement a process known as ‘widespread surveillance testing’,” FutureCare Spokeswoman Holly O’Shea said. “This testing monitors the intensity and spread of the disease in a community with high transmission, like zip code 21215.”   “Given this location is also a large facility, with 200 beds, we felt strongly that it was important to know who was carrying the virus, even if they didn’t present specific COVID-19 symptoms, to mitigate its spread and protect our staff and residents,” O’Shea continued. “In fact, most of our positives tested over the weekend presented no symptoms of any kind. This type of surveillance testing is unprecedented and can save lives.”   “FutureCare’s highest priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our staff and residents, and we will continue to work diligently with the state and local health departments, our LifeBridge health partners, and our Johns Hopkins infectious disease consultant, to protect our staff and residents,” she continued.”FutureCare has employed infection control procedures, and was an early adapter of visitation restriction, universal masking, and have implemented all of Governor Hogan’s orders.”   According to officials, all residents who tested negative for COVID-19 are being moved out of the facility.

Health care workers need those when they’re  treating coronavirus patients .  You should also note:     Face covering  is  recommended but not mandatory       Homemade masks are  not  a substitute for social distancing and staying in     Still, if you want to make a mask, here are step-by-step instructions — based on guidance from the  Vanderbilt University Medical Center  and  Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin .   Not sure how to wear or clean the masks? We answer those questions under the mask-making instructions.   Materials you’ll need      2 pieces of tight-weave cotton fabric, 9 x 6 inches (per mask)   4 strips of fabric, 2 x 16 inches (per mask)   Ruler   Sewing machine OR needle and thread   Pencil or marker   Scissors   A handful of sewing pins   Iron     Make your mask   1. Cut your fabric into two 9 x 6-inch rectangles. Place them on top of each other.   2. On the top of the 9-inch side, pin or mark a 2-inch opening in the center of the top edge of the 9-inch side, between the 3.5- and 5.5-inch points, along the top edge. Then, sew the edges on either side of where you pinned or marked the opening. You’ll need that 2-inch opening to turn the mask right side out.   3. Sew the other three sides of the mask shut, too.   4. Turn the mask right side out through the 2-inch opening you left on the top. Then, press the mask with an iron to get rid of wrinkles.   5. Line your ruler up vertically along the 6-inch side of the mask. Starting at the 1.5-inch line, pin where you’ll sew your pleats down the side. These pleats help the mask stretch.   Pin again at the 2-, 3-, 3.5-, 4.5- and 5-inch lines.   6. Bring the pin at the 1.5-inch line down to the 2-inch line, and voila, you’ve made a pleat! Repeat with the 3-inch to the 3.5-inch and the 4.5-inch to the 5-inch line. Pin your new pleats, and repeat on the other side.   7. Sew the sides of your mask up so the pleats are laid flat.   Make mask ties   1. Cut four strips of fabric, 2 inches wide by 16 inches long.   2. Fold them in half lengthwise.   3. Turn them under 1/4-inch on the long side.   4. Iron them in place, then stitch the long side shut.   5. Pin each tie to a corner of the mask.   6. Sew around the perimeter of the mask once more so the ties are attached — and now you’ve completed your mask.     Mask FAQs   How do I wear it?    Masks are only effective if you wear them properly. The  World Health Organization  has the how-to:     Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water before touching or putting on the mask.   Make sure your entire nose and mouth are covered when you put it on.   Avoid touching the mask while you’re out — this can contaminate it.   Do not take the mask off while you’re in public.   To take it off once you return, untie it from the back — don’t touch the front of it.   You should immediately wash the mask after returning so it doesn’t contaminate your belongings.   Wash your hands immediately after you’ve taken it off, and again after you’ve washed the mask.     Are masks even effective?    Homemade mask  studies have shown that they’re significantly less effective than surgical masks  — and they’re certainly no replacement for the essential N95 respirators health care workers must wear to treat patients.   “Homemade masks are partially effective,” said Dr. Koushik Kasanagottu, an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Maryland.   They offer a physical barrier from viral particles, he said, but they don’t have the filters that N95 respirators do.   But they’re better than nothing, especially for people who only go out in public to make a quick trip to the grocery store or pharmacy, said Anna Davies and Raina MacIntyre, public health researchers and authors of two separate studies on the effectiveness of cloth mask.   It’s important to note, though, that masks cannot replace social distancing measures. Maintaining at least six feet of distance from others and staying home as much as possible is still the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.   How do you clean them?    You should launder the masks before and after each use to clean off any germs you might have picked up in public. Hand wash the masks or put them in a mesh wash bag in the washing machine so they don’t fall apart, and use a high heat setting.   What if my craft store is closed or out of supplies?    Crafters on Etsy  aren’t sold out of face masks yet. It’s difficult to discern how effective these masks are since you didn’t craft them yourself, but you can compare them to our mask tutorial before you buy — does it cover your nose and mouth? Are there pleats? Will it tightly seal around your face?   You likely don’t need to buy more than a few masks — physicians recommend that  only one member of each household runs errands in public .   It may take longer than usual to ship the masks, so be aware of this when you buy.   And be sure to wash the masks before you wear them.   If you can’t access masks at all, then  keep washing your hands , maintaining distance from others and following other social distancing measures. Staying home is the best defense against coronavirus, after all.   The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

(WJZ) —  Many local farms have seen an increased demand for their products during the coronavirus pandemic.  As people grow wary of making frequent trips to the grocery store and struggle to find stocked shelves, many are turning to farms for local, fresh and safe food products.   “We’ve been trying for years to get people to try to buy local and I believe the pandemic has actually helped us make people realize that buying local is better,” said Jamie Brown, Owner and Operator of TLV Tree Farm.   TLV Tree Farm in Howard County  says right now, business is up. So much so, they’re gearing up to provide more meats, eggs and vegetables to meet the rising demand from the community.   “We didn’t have the supply when the demand hit, which we had no idea that the demand was going to hit as early as it did, but we will catch up,” said Brown.   To make it easier for residents to find more options of fresh local farm products, Howard County launched an  interactive online map called “HoCo Farms Connect”  on Tuesday.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This pandemic just not only was a challenge, but it created an opportunity for us to really help people understand to shop local,” said Calvin Ball, Howard County Executive.   Through the database, shoppers can search for the type of products they’re looking for such produce, dairy or meats. From there, the database connects them with the available farms.   County officials hope this will encourage more people to continue supporting the farm-to-table culture.   “Every dollar that people spend shopping locally, about 67 cents goes back into our local community,” said Ball.

The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the season back nearly a month already and it seems unlikely the Boys of Summer will take the field any time soon.   There have been several reported plans considered. One involves taking all 30 teams to Arizona and playing out the full season in the desert with players, team officials and staff in hotels isolated from fans and families. Another would see the teams return to their respective Spring Training facilities, replace the National and American Leagues, and play things out based on whether teams are in the Grapefruit (Florida) or Cactus (Arizona) leagues.   Neither of those proposals really speaks to WJZ sports anchor Mark Viviano. While he understands that getting the sport back on television to provide fans something to watch is key, he just doesn’t feel right about having teams play away from their home cities. Though he acknowledges, these are unusual times.   “An elongated version of that just wouldn’t feel right to me, none of it feels right, let’s be honest. These are unusual times,” said Viviano in an interview with CBS Local’s Katie Johnston. “So I guess as we start to get further into… I mean, they’re not going to start the season, at best, as we speak, till late May, June. So you’re already talking a rather truncated season. Make it 100 games, and then just work your schedule from there. But as to where they start and how they start, yes, so much to be determined.”   While the when and where of the MLB season re-starting is still up for debate, whenever it does happen, Viviano believes the shortened nature will hurt the Baltimore Orioles. The main reason for that belief? The team needs time for its young players to acclimate to professional ball and time is the one thing the major and minor leagues are running short on at the moment.   “It hurts the Orioles, and in this regard. They are a team entering the second season of a full-fledged rebuild. In other words, they have torn down their structure, with a whole new regime brought in to build it back up. You’re building it back up with young talent. That young talent is in the minor leagues,” said Viviano. “If the major leaguers aren’t playing, for sure the minor leaguers aren’t playing. And these young players, who really need to be getting the seasoning, the build up, the training toward becoming big leaguers, this is time last for them. Now you can say, well, every team’s in the same boat. Well, in terms of time lost, they are. But I think the time is more valuable for a team like the Orioles. It’s more needed because they have so many young players.”   Viviano acknowledges of course that every team in the league will have to deal with less time for their young players to progress. But, for guys like last year’s first overall pick Adley Rutschman, less time this year is likely to mean more time in the minors and an extended rebuilding timeline.

(WJZ) —  A 26-year-old Glen Burnie man was arrested in an alleged armed robbery spree of delivery drivers near his home, police say.  According to Anne Arundel County police, there were at least four incidents starting in December allegedly linked to Anthony Ronald Stoddard Jr. All of the robberies occurred just a block away from where Stoddard lives.   Anthony Ronald Stoddard Jr.   The first robbery was reported on Dec. 5, 2019 around 7 p.m. A delivery driver from China Spring Carry-Out said he was delivering food in the 6400 block of Jefferson Place when he was approached by an unknown man in all black pointing a long firearm at him. The suspect demanded the man put the food on the ground and then stole the food valued at just over $31.   The next reported incident wasn’t until March 16 around 8:20 p.m. Officers responded to Ocean Restaurant for a reported robbery. Again, police say another delivery driver said he took food to the 6400 block of Washington Square when he was also approached by an unknown man with what looked like a shotgun and demanded the driver put the food on the ground. He complied and the suspect ran off with $36 worth of food and $300 cash.   Then just days later on March 22 around 9:50 p.m. officers responded to Heritage Hills for a reported robbery. Another delivery driver said he was taking food to a home in the 6400 block of Jefferson Place when an unknown man in a hoodie pointing a long gun at home and demanded the driver drop his money to the ground. This time the suspect fled with $100.   Finally on March 28 around 10:30 p.m. officers responded to Easy Moon Bistro & Sushi for a reported robbery. Another delivery driver told police he was taking food to the 6400 block of Jefferson Place, but when he got there, the residents said they didn’t order the food. As he returned to his car, an unknown man approached him and pointed a long gun at his head.  The victim was able to flee before anything was stolen.   On Wednesday, April 15, police identified Stoddard, who lives in the 6400 block of Mt. Vernon Lane, as a suspect.  He was charged in all four robberies.   Weapons recovered from Anthony Stoddard’s home. Credit: AACO Police   On Thursday morning, detectives searched Stoddard’s residence and recovered six long guns, including one that was sawed off and shorter than the legal limit.                                     ", "sentiment": 0.019202898550724636, "subjectivity": 0.3771739130434782, "wordcount": 415}

Beginning Thursday, April 23, prospects from across the country will hear their names called as they find out what their destinations will be in the NFL.   Things will be of course, a little bit different. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the entirety of the draft is being held virtually with general managers operating from their various homes. For Ravens GM Eric DeCosta, improving a team that went 14-2 last year is going to come down to filling in a couple of positions in particular. The first, as WJZ sports anchor Mark Viviano points out is the interior of the offensive line.   “With the retirement of Marshal Yanda and the injury to Matt Skura, they have a clear need on the interior offensive line,” said Viviano in an interview with CBS Local’s Katie Johnston. “Now, that doesn’t mean that is a position they will be drafting high because the Ravens really believe, and they have a history of doing this, picking third, fourth, fifth or later and turning those offensive line picks into starters. That though, it’s a need, and is probably not something I’m going to see them address high up.”   Currently holding seven picks in the 2nd through 5th rounds, the Ravens have plenty of opportunity to add to the interior of the offensive line in those later rounds. But, the question is what will the team do with the 28th overall pick in the first round? Some fans would love to see a move up the board to snag a wide receiver. Others may argue a running back to complement Mark Ingram and Gus Edwards would be a good move. But, Viviano again points to the interior, this time on the defensive side of the ball.   “(Patrick) Queen from LSU and [Kenneth] Murray out of Oklahoma seem to be the top candidates for that if they’re available at 28,” said Viviano. “It leads to question as to whether Eric DeCosta, now in his second draft as general manager, might move up if he fears those guys won’t be there. Or move down and out of the first round, let someone else move up into the first round and he figures he could find quality in the second round.”   Queen and Murray are both currently slotted in the 23-28 range in CBSSports.com’s prospect rankings. If either is there at 28, it would be a solid upgrade in the middle of a defense that has one of the league’s deepest secondaries and added help up front in Calais Campbell and Derek Wolfe.   But, no matter what happens next weekend, there is a bigger question currently looming over the NFL season. How will the coronavirus pandemic impact the league? It has, as Viviano points out, already pushed the first set of team OTAs virtual as facilities remain closed. What will come next?   “The next impact will come in terms of when will these players be together on a field to begin practicing? Will there be mini camps,” asked Viviano. “I don’t think so. I don’t think you’re going to see the typical rookie mini camps and veteran mini camps that we see in May and June. That just seems unlikely.”   If minicamps are canceled due to social distancing guidelines, that would mean the first time teams would likely be able to have everybody back together would be July for training camp. Will that lead to fewer postseason games to allow time for training? Or skip the preseason all together and just hold training camps and OTAs in order to allow teams to ramp up for the season? The only thing that is certain at the moment is uncertainty as we continue to wait to a return to some form of normal for the sports world.

The payments designed to help combat an economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic are meant to cover as many people as possible.

Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said he was alerted to the situation by a text message from a friend said his dad, who died in 2018, had received $1,200 from the government.   “Ok this is insane, but just the tip of the iceberg, Massie, one of the few lawmakers who opposed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act stimulus bill, tweeted.

Mailed checks for those who don’t have bank account information on file will start going out next week, but it could take months for all the payments to be distributed,  Bloomberg  reported.   Errors such as payments to deceased people are a consequence of lawmakers trying to balance accuracy with distributing the money as quickly as possible, says Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy at the  American Action Forum , a conservative policy research group.   “Congress erred on the side of speed, which nearly everyone agreed was the right answer in this case,” he told Bloomberg.   Nina Olson, the former head of the  Taxpayer Advocate Service , an internal IRS watchdog, doubts the IRS will ask for the money back. She told  Marketwatch  the CARES Act stimulus bill contained no “clawback” provisions to retrieve money sent to a dead person after it’s been handed out.

His interest in the science behind the performance of the world’s top athletes began at a young age, when as a child in Virginia, he grew up watching the Orioles star Cal Ripken Jr., the Redskins Super Bowl runs and the Washington Bullets take home an NBA championship.  The passion for understanding the performance of the world’s top athletes has extended to other areas of performance as well, which is what led to his partnership with the Kill Cliff brand which produces energy, endurance and performance drinks for athletes. The brand, which was founded in 2013 by former United States Navy SEAL Todd Ehrlich, aims to provide a more natural energy drink made with clean ingredients for athletes looking to improve their performance.   But, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, workouts and sports performance, while a part of the wellness equation, aren’t the entire picture. That’s why the brand is hosting a  livestream on its YouTube channel  on Friday, April 17 from 7-8pm EST titled “How To Be Resilient.” The stream which will feature both former Navy SEALs and sports luminaries like Baltimore Ravens legend Ray Lewis, MMA fighter Ryan Bader, Man vs. Wild’s Bear Grylls and more, aims to help provide people the tools they need to remain resilient in these uncertain times.   “What’s incredible about this current situation is, there are a lot of times when people say, ‘oh my god, I made a bad decision and this bad thing happened’. We happen to be in a situation as a country and really the world, where I didn’t do anything. And then all of a sudden I’m locked up in my house so the feeling is this is unfair and this is out of nowhere,” said Brenkus in a phone interview. “That feeling is one that we want to address. We need to tap into being resilient and there’s nobody better on the planet than a Navy SEAL to tell you, look, things are not fair. Life is not set up to be fair, and your mindset is really a choice. There are a lot of tools that you can use to reframe the situation that you’re in, to be able to get yourself out of any kind of mental funk.”   Brenkus says that the company feels this event is really more of a public service than anything, giving people the tools that they need to be able to handle the adversity that life is currently throwing at all of us. It is that toolbox that Brenkus says he hopes is the main takeaway that people get from tuning into the stream.   “You learn how to ride a bike and you can ride a bike forever. Many of us are challenged and we need to learn how to be resilient and, you know, you can always refine those skills,” said Brenkus. “Whether or not you’re somebody who is just super down right now or whether you feel like you’re just not operating at your optimal level, this is something that you can really benefit from.”   “I feel like we as a world are stitched together as one more than ever, and I feel like when there’s an authentic message out there, it’s something that we’re all going to listen to and, this is certainly designed to be a source of positive inspirational content that can help you today. And everyday moving forward,” Brenkus continued.   The psychology of human performance is an area that Brenkus really feels is the next area of exploration for the sports science field.   “What we’re finding the numbers and what I can really conclude through  Sports Science  is look the numbers are only part of the story,” said Brenkus. “Many people fall in love with what I refer to as the top of the curve, they want to be the biggest, strongest, and fastest. But you hit a certain point and it’s proven over and over when you look at athletes that are undersized that the metric aspect of it is only one aspect of the equation. Those intangible aspects, the psychological aspect of how you deal with adversity and how you bounce back from failure. The difference between good and great are those who are more confident of their ability to try and humble enough in their ability to get better. So, when you have that combination, that’s what really defines greatness.”   Brenkus’ passion for sports performance and quantifying it has led to a career with six Emmy nominations, a best-selling book ( The Perfection Point),  and partnerships across the sports world. But, what he really values most is the relationships that he has built with athletes over time.   “I’ve always been drawn toward storytelling but very truthful honest storytelling. That’s really centered around perpetuating positive energy,” said Brenkus. “And if you just look at the practice of Sport Science really featuring the world’s greatest athletes, being pushed to their limits, through different tests that we end up creating. We’ve never paid a single athlete ever to enter the lab. I believe that people who are the best at what they do will do things not out of desire for financial gain but out of desire to be truly great, and part of being truly great is to recognize that you can always get better. So that’s why we are so blessed and fortunate to have been part of a movement of looking at sport through the lens of science and also being introduced to some incredible human beings men and women from every sport who are the best at what they do.”   Now, Brenkus, in conjunction with Kill Cliff, is trying to make a wider impact with an audience here in the United States that may need some positive messaging right now.

In The Dark  stars Perry Mattfeld as Murphy Mason, a blind woman navigating her way through her twenties. In season one viewers saw Murphy attempt to unravel the mystery of her murdered friend, Tyson, and left off with her in the hospital following a vicious car crash.  CBS  Local’s Matt Weiss spoke with Mattfeld ahead of tonight’s season premiere to discuss the challenges of playing a blind woman and the escape from reality  In The Dark  seeks to deliver for its fans.   MW:  Good morning Perry!  In  The Dark ,  season two , kicking off to night, c ongratulations.  W hat was it about the show that made you want to get involved in the first place ?     PM:  Hey Matt, thanks, you know  I’ve  said before I usually kind of judge how I feel about  a  script based on how quickly I’m able to get through it . Y ou know when you’re reading a book sometimes you feel like you read the same page over and over again ;  if I have to go back a ton of times and  ask  who said what or what so and so did that’s not great, but I flew through that pilot of  In The Dark,  I laughed out loud .  I remember it got me choked up,   I  felt so much in 45 pages,  I flew through it .    I just felt like it was written in such a natural conversational way and t t  was so easy to connect to .  I don’t think anyone knew it was going to be as funny as it  turned out . I don’t think anyone would have predicted we’d be where we are now ,  I don’t think I could have ever guessed what  the show was going to be about . It’s awesome.     MW:   Y our character, Murphy Mason, is blind of course .   W hat kind of preparation did you have to do in order to play this role ?     PM:   W ell  l uckily for me, and for everyone, the show is inspired by a real person named Lori .  Lori  is not only involved in the writing process  but  is my right hand through all of this .   I spent a couple weeks with her before we even started filming just obsessing over her, o bsessing over her day-to-day,  I spent  hours with her .   N ot only did I need to learn how she use s her  guide dog ,  but watching her get ready for bed ,  watching her make a snack in her kitchen ,  watching her go through her closet ,  watching her do   her morning routine all that kind of stuff . I j ust had to obsess over the physicality because Murphy as a whole is such a handful besides the physical so I needed to make sure that I could at least  try.     I’ll never fully understand being in her shoes but I had to at least try to educate myself as much as possible about the physical so that when  I  went to go try to deal with the emotional and mental part of  Murphy,   I  felt a little more prepared about the physical .  Now  I’m able  to talk to Lori all the way through when she’s there on set .  I’m able to watch her go through the blocking .   S o ,  if the director says roll out of bed go grab a beer from the fridge ,  I can watch her do it  and  then mimic her .   I t’s helpful as an actor to be able to replicate a real person .   I’m  literally  copying  the person that is supposed to be Murphy .     MW:  Yeah,  that sounds like an incredible asset for you . W hat’s been the most challenging part for you?   PM:   I’ve  said before when I read some of these scenes for the first time and every line of Murphy’s is ‘shut up ,  no ,  idiot ,  shut up ,  shut   up stupid .’ The  hard part for me is  it’s my job to find the moments in between her lines, in between when she’s talking,  to find  the moments that make her lovable, t hat make people  want to  root for her .  I have to find the  in between  or the little underlying piece of Murphy that is human .  It’s about t he goodness of her ,  the kindness of her that make people still want her to come out on top .      Chloe is a huge part of  seeing  that, h er relationship with Chloe .   Ty son was a huge part of that  in  season one .   Her  relationship  with Pretzel,  there’s some affection that you see there as well .   It’s  definitely hard for me to find a balance sometimes just as an actor .  Murphy’s strength is obviously one of her best qualities .       MW:  I can imagine it can be hard to pull off sympathetic while telling people to shut up at the same time .     PM:  [Laughs] Even  if the other characters around me don’t see it the audience has to s ee it. W hat is it that I can do whether it’s with my facial expressions or some sort of physical movement just  so the  audience sees at least she thought about it or at least she felt it .   E ven if she didn’t say that she felt bad; s he feels it .   A lways trying to find those  moments.     MW:   L ast season ended with the big car crash and then  Nia  c a me  to  tell Murphy that she is actually on the hook for the money that Felix and  Jess  took .   W here do we pick up tonight ?     PM:  E xactly where  we  left off, a ll the same bruises . T hat was fun to come back and  have to replicate exactly where I was at the end of season one .   I love that at the end of season one  you  get some closure in terms of the whole Tyson  arc,  but it didn’t bring him back .   N ow she’s in a bigger hole than she ever was .   It  sets up a really interesting season .   I t’s shocking where it goes .     MW:   W e were talking about it a little bit before ,  but what does it mean to be able to provide people with entertainment at this time when everyone is locked indoors?   PM:  I’ve always said that’s part of why I enjoy playing characters  is  I’ve always considered myself a character  actor.   I t’s fun to bring characters that are like yourself b ut I enjoy even more so creating a character that is so  far  from  who   I am be cause of that escape;   i t’s pretend .   It’s a chance  to completely pretend you’re in another world that either doesn’t exist or that you’ve never been  a part  of .  I think that’s one of the great things about  In The D ark   is that  it does have a very genuine raw kind of ground ing  to it .     People right now are feeling especially vulnerable . I think they’ll actually get to know some vulnerable characters watching our show and even  a little laugh with it.   T here’s definitely  going to  be an opportunity to completely escape .  I think people will enjoy the season and will be able to escape with these characters .   MW:  L ast question before I let you go ,  pu t  you on th e spot  little bit .   I f you could describe the new season in three words ,  what would they be ?     PM:    Oo h,  does  br eaking  b ad  count as  one or two?   MW:  Let’s go with one.   PM:  OK  b reaking ba d,  thrilling, a nd deceit.     MW:  Thank you so much for the time today Perry, all the best and stay safe!   PM:  Thanks, Matt! Same to you!

Inside Saint Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, doctors say four COVID-19 patients are hanging onto life.   “I’m an ICU doctor, so all my patients are critically ill,” Dr. Pablo Garcia said. “All have varying degrees of organ failure.”   ER’s across the country are swamped, overflowing with desperately ill coronavirus patients.

CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The Mayo Clinic and hospitals across the country want those survivors to donate now.   Saint Agnes is part of this emergency clinical trial.   “The idea of this experimental therapy is that, if we can get plasma from someone who has been sick with COVID-19 but has recovered, that plasma carries antibodies to the virus,” Garcia said, “We can transfuse those antibodies to someone who is still fighting the virus and potentially help their immune system.”   Baltimore City has at least two institutions partnering with the Mayo Clinic, including Johns Hopkins University.   The Red Cross will also be on the frontlines of this emergency study, collecting plasma from survivors.   Kevin Greenaugh said the study is a no brainer and that he’ll donate if he qualifies.   “I just think that from a spiritual perspective, from a society perspective, that if I have the antibody in my body that can help other people, this is something that I should do,” Greenaugh said.   It’s a possible fix patients and their doctors across the country hope will work.   “We don’t know yet, but it certainly has potential to be a game-changer,” Garcia said.

The department’s arguments came in a court filing after a grassroots organization and activists sued to stop the pilot program from kicking off. Under the six-month pilot program, cameras attached to up to three airplanes will collect images of the city to help investigate homicides, nonfatal shootings, armed robberies and carjackings.   “As the City suffers persistently high levels of violent crime, philanthropic funding in excess of $3.6 million has made it possible for BPD to evaluate adding a potential investigatory tool for its detectives to use in combatting the most serious of violent crimes,” the department’s lawyers wrote in their court filing.   The planes, their pilots, analysts and hangar space will be funded by the nonprofit of Texas billionaires Laura and John Arnold. A private company will operate the airplanes and provide staff who will analyze the images.   The aircraft will fly for at least 40 hours a week. The technology is capable of capturing 32 square miles (83 square kilometers) of the city per image per second.   The civil complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore argues the program infringes upon the reasonable expectation of privacy regarding movement, results in indiscriminate searches without a warrant and impedes the right to gather freely.   The police department’s attorneys argued that aerial photography and surveillance is not a search. They say the U.S. Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Maryland, “have held constitutional far more intrusive aerial surveillance than that contemplated” by Baltimore’s pilot program.   Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison had expressed skepticism over the use of the planes, describing the idea as an “untested” crime-fighting strategy, before he announced the pilot program in December.   The Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the plaintiffs.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

As concern for inmates and correctional officers grows, the chief judge of Maryland is ordering lower courts to identify juvenile offenders who could be released amid the pandemic, as well as identify offenders in general who are at risk for contracting the coronavirus for possible release.   In an order Tuesday , Judge Mary Ellen Barbera said lower courts should identify the high-risk offenders in order to protect the inmate population as a whole.   Before releasing an offender, the courts should consider whether that person is a threat to the community, whether the facility they’re being held at can address coronavirus-related medical issues and whether the person shows any symptoms of the virus, the order reads.

You may be skipping a form of exercise that can help mitigate one of the biggest risk factors associated with this condition.   Despite what you may have read or heard, there is no conclusive evidence that running causes osteoarthritis (the most common form of arthritis, often in the hips and knees as well as the hands), or that you shouldn’t be running at all if you have osteoarthritis. Since there is no cure for it, doctors usually look to treat osteoarthritis with a combination of therapies that includes increased physical activity.   You should speak with your primary care doctor or physical therapist about exercises that are right for you, but it’s possible that running can help manage osteoarthritis, says Grace “Annie” Neurohr, DPT, CMTPT, a therapist and running specialist in the  running program  at the  Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics  at  Sinai Hospital of Baltimore .   “One of the biggest factors in osteoarthritis and knee pain is weight gain. Running can keep your weight down, decreasing the amount of force that goes through your knee joint,” Neurohr says.   In addition to decreasing body fat, running can help build the strength and endurance your muscles need to support your joints, Neurohr adds. It can also help decrease the regular workload of the cardiovascular system and lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood. In other words, running can be one of the best ways to combat the development or progression of osteoarthritis.   Neurohr says that while she doesn’t typically recommend high-mileage running for someone with osteoarthritis, recommendations depend on the person’s “symptoms, body type and grade of osteoarthritis.”   She adds: “I typically recommend that runners with osteoarthritis have a good strength training program to complement their running. Improving the strength of the muscles around the hips and knees can better protect the joint with higher-impact activities. I also recommend they run on slightly softer surfaces such as packed dirt, trails or tracks as opposed to concrete.”   Among the biggest risk factors for osteoarthritis in addition to obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:      joint injury or overuse (repetitive stress on a joint)   gender (women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis than men, especially after 50)   family history     The CDC says people who have hand osteoarthritis are more likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knee. The risk of developing osteoarthritis also increases with age. But middle-aged people shouldn’t be discouraged from running, Neurohr says.   “Some of the best distance runners are over the age of 40 and still getting faster,” she says.   Neurohr advises aging runners to focus on calf strength. “These muscles lose power quicker as we age and are crucial in giving us efficient push-off as we propel ourselves forward,” she says.   Neurohr also recommends calcium and vitamin D supplements, which she says “can be helpful in maintaining bone health, which is very important for avoiding stress injuries or fractures as we age.” (Remember to consult your doctor first before taking any new supplements.)   “These supplements can help compound the gains you can make in a strength training program and help build stronger bones and maintain muscle strength,” she says.

Is it still safe to go to the doctor’s office for appointments?   Should I be doing more to keep me and my baby healthy?   Amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, these are the kinds of questions you’re probably asking yourself if you’re pregnant.   There is still much for medical experts to learn about how COVID-19 could cause problems during pregnancy, whether it can be passed to the fetus, and how it can affect the health of babies after birth. But there is concern for women with high-risk pregnancies, including women who have diabetes, chronic hypertension or lung problems.   Pregnant women in general experience changes in their bodies that can increase risk for infection, and with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections (such as influenza), they may have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   “Pregnant women have increased needs for good pulmonary function. Therefore, any pregnant woman who has significant lung problems would be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection. This would include severe asthma, HIV, chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and immunocompromise states,” says  Pedro P. Arrabal, M.D. , director of maternal-fetal medicine at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore. “Our recommendations are extrapolations from women having been infected with influenza. However, much information is still unknown about the effects of this virus in pregnancy, and pregnant women should not be lulled into a false sense of complacency about this infection.”   At the first sign of infection, “such as difficulty breathing, fever, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, chest pressure, nausea and vomiting,” and dehydration, you need to be medically evaluated, Arrabal says. “There may be a higher risk of preterm labor and you should be evaluated ASAP. If there is a clinical need for radiologic studies such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan, they can safely be performed during pregnancy and they should not be delayed,” he adds.    Is it still safe (or necessary) to go to appointments?   Do you have to conduct all your pregnancy appointments at the doctor’s office during the COVID-19 pandemic? Well, if your pregnancy isn’t considered high-risk, and depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy, telemedicine visits may be an option for you. Sinai, for instance, recently implemented telemedicine visits via phone calls for checkups and, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, is prepared to conduct phone visits during the early weeks of pregnancy after the all-important initial in-person pregnancy visit.   “Coincidentally, we had recently instituted telemedicine for diabetes education and genetic counseling. This has worked out very well,” Arrabal says.   Many patients, however, require ultrasounds and an evaluation of their vital signs, particularly those at risk for hypertension. “Many of the ultrasound procedures and fetal testing that we do in pregnancy have significant time limitations and need to be performed at specific times during the pregnancy,” Arrabal says.   Also, if you are at 24 weeks gestational age and beyond, you will need to be seen in person. “It is important to have regular blood pressure checks and visits with a physician as you get closer to your delivery date,” says  Elizabeth Zadzielski, M.D. , chief of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Sinai.   Zadzielski stresses that an in-person visit is necessary if you just recently found out you’re pregnant.   “It is extremely important to have that first ultrasound to determine how far along you are. Important blood work and tests, such as the first trimester screen, still need to be done as well,” Zadzielski says.   In addition, if you’ve been experiencing problems with bleeding or decreased fetal movement, or if there are concerns about preterm labor, you will need to be seen in a doctor’s office or OB triage unit. “Patients whose fetuses are at risk for compromise and stillbirth need to be seen on a regular basis for fetal testing,” Arrabal says.   He adds: “Delivery still needs to occur in the hospital or birthing center setting, and not at home.”   Take precaution   What should you do if you’re pregnant to protect you and your baby amid the COVID-19 outbreak? Essentially the same things as the general public: good hand hygiene (use soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer), social distancing, plenty of rest and nutritious meals.   “Try to get outside and into some fresh air,” Zadzielski says. “As compelling as the news may be, try to limit exposure to the media blitz that can provoke anxiety.”   Visit lifebridgehealth.org or call 410-601-WELL to learn more about our services at LifeBridge Health and scheduling an appointment.

But is one more effective than the other?  Alexander Chen, M.D., FACP , of the  Division of Infectious Diseases  at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, explains the importance of both:    Which should you buy?   If you’re having trouble finding hand sanitizer and all you have is soap, it’s okay. You’re not stuck with the inferior option.   Both soap and alcohol-based sanitizer are effective for eliminating coronaviruses. “Both methods should disrupt the coating of the virus, while soap also helps remove the virus mechanically,” Chen says.   If you are lucky enough to find a bottle of hand sanitizer, check the label and make sure it has at least 60 percent alcohol content. Sanitizer comes in handy when you’re out and about and a sink isn’t nearby, though you shouldn’t use it if your hands are dirty or greasy.   Antibacterial soap is a good choice, but really “either type of soap will be fine,” Chen says. If your hands become dry from frequent hand-washing, use whichever hand lotion you are accustomed to. “I don’t have any preference, but some people may have sensitive skin and can look for products that are hypoallergenic,” Chen says.   Another good thing about that elusive hand sanitizer: most have a moisturizer included.   What about washing your face?   One of the main things you are urged to do to protect yourself from the coronavirus is avoid touching your face (mainly your eyes, nose and mouth). But what if you need to wash your face? Or apply makeup and other facial products? Or floss?   It’s still OK to do the necessary things involving your face—but after you clean your hands thoroughly.   “You should perform hand hygiene before touching your face, including eating and drinking,” Chen says. “Since many of us touch our face without realizing it, try to keep track of where your hands are.”   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (especially after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing). When you use sanitizer, cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.   “If you are caring for or with anyone who might be sick, perform hand hygiene after you touch anything. In addition, if you are in a high-traffic area, you can use hand sanitizer any time you touch anything that might not be clean,” Chen says.   Try to avoid touching as many surfaces as possible when you’re in public. “I like to keep my hands in my pockets when I’m out, that way I minimize what I touch,” Chen says.

Check out the video below for an exclusive sneak peek at this brand-new novella collection, which will be released on April 21 from ViacomCBS sister company Simon & Schuster.   Stephen King has published more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers. Now the #1  New York Times  bestselling author and master of short fiction has written an extraordinary collection of four new and compelling novellas: “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone,” “The Life of Chuck,” “Rat,”   and the title story, “ If It Bleeds .”   Just as impactful and enduring as his longer fiction, King’s short stories are their own dark treat. His full range is on display once again with  If It Bleeds , which offers readers four more works sure to prove as iconic as their predecessors. In the title story, reader favorite Holly Gibney (from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and  The Outsider ) must face her fears, and possibly another outsider—this time on her own. In “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” an intergenerational friendship has a disturbing afterlife. “The Life of Chuck” explores, beautifully, how each of us contains multitudes. And in “Rat,” a struggling writer must contend with the darker side of ambition.   If these stories exhibit King’s creative depths, they also prove that certain themes endure. One of King’s great concerns is evil, and in  If It Bleeds , there’s plenty of it, imagined in the title story as “a big bird, all frowsy and frosty grey.” There is also evil’s opposite, which in King’s fiction often manifests as friendship. In these stories, Holly Gibney is reminded that friendship is not only life-affirming but can be life-saving.   King also reminds us that life’s quotidian pleasures are even more glorious because they are fleeting: the outrageous good fortune of a beautiful blue day after a string of grey ones; the delight of dancing really well, when every move feels perfect; a serendipitous meeting. It’s in these moments that King’s ability to describe pure joy rivals his ability to terrify us.

The email is  ui.inquiry@maryland.gov .   There’s also  a new way to file for unemployment in Maryland,  after the system was inundated with calls and emails over the last few weeks.   Ricci assured residents that no one will lose benefits or be penalized because of missing a deadline for weekly certification, and they’ll be sending messages to those claimants with instructions on how to fix this issue and file their certifications for previous weeks.   Ricci has also said they’ve added a button on their website for people to submit their email addresses so they can keep them up to date when the system is up and running.   It takes 21 days total to process claims and then get the first benefit payment out, he said, which includes all payments from the date of eligibility, he added.

The patients taking part in a clinical trial of the drug have all had severe respiratory symptoms and fever, but were able to leave the hospital after less than a week of treatment,  STAT quoted the doctor  leading the trial as saying.   “The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish,”  Dr. Kathleen Mullane , an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago who is leading the clinical trial, said in the video.   Mullane did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.   The University of Chicago said Mullane’s comments constituted partial information.   “Partial data from an ongoing clinical trial is by definition incomplete and should never be used to draw conclusions about the safety or efficacy of a potential treatment that is under investigation,” it said in a statement.   “In this case, information from an internal forum for research colleagues concerning work in progress was released without authorization. Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”   There is no approved therapy for the Covid-19, which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in some patients. But the National Institutes of Health  is organizing trials  of several drugs and other treatments, among them remdesivir.   The drug, made by Gilead Sciences, was tested against Ebola with little success, but multiple studies in animals showed the drug could both prevent and treat coronaviruses related to Covid-19, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).   Back in February, the World Health Organization said remdesivir showed potential against Covid-19.   STAT said it obtained and viewed a copy of the video discussion Mullane had last week with colleagues about the trial.   “Most of our patients are severe and most of them are leaving at six days, so that tells us duration of therapy doesn’t have to be 10 days,” she was quoted as saying.   However, the trial does not include what’s known as a control group, so it will be difficult to say whether the drug is truly helping patients recover better. With a control arm, some patients do not receive the drug being tested so that doctors can determine whether it’s the drug that is really affecting their condition.   Trials of the drug are ongoing at dozens of other clinical centers, as well. Gilead is sponsoring tests of the drug in 2,400 patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in 152 trial sites around the world. It’s also testing the drug in 1,600 patients with moderate symptoms at 169 hospitals and clinics around the world.   Gilead said it expected results from the trial by the end of the month.   “We understand the urgent need for a COVID-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir,” the company said in a statement to CNN. But it said a few stories about patients are just that — stories.   “The totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial. Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19,” Gilead said.

Washington, D.C. topped the list with 54 percent of residents staying home, followed by New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Michigan.

(AP) —  Long linked by proximity and the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who live and work in their jurisdictions, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia are now connected by the growing numbers of coronavirus cases they are battling.  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser spoke in a conference call Friday to discuss coordinating virus response efforts. Hogan said the three officials have frequently spoken over the past month. Hogan also noted that their staffs are in daily contact.   “While we may have individual differences about how we’re going after different things, the sharing of information, the willingness to try to cooperate on things that are of importance to the region has been terrific, and it has been throughout the crisis, and I think it’s going to continue,” Hogan said Friday after the call.   Hogan noted that this was the deadliest week yet in the region in and around the nation’s capital. He said the area has had more than 21,000 cases of coronavirus and 818 deaths.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     As states review guidelines from the White House aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, cases in areas near the capital are “going up rather than down,” said Hogan, who is the chairman of the National Governors Association.   “We’re all in some part of a phase of talking about the gradual reopening but not able to start that quite yet, and we all are in agreement that we want to do that in a way that’s cooperative,” said Hogan, a Republican. “We understand that while each area is unique that there are certainly things that we have to do together as a region.”   Northam, a Democrat, said at a news conference Friday that Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and the District would “do everything that we can to be in coordination and be consistent” when it comes to reopening the economy.   “We share some of the same challenges, and we will do everything that we can to be in coordination and be consistent so we’ll be as straightforward as possible for everybody in this region,” Northam said.   Northam said he, Hogan and Bowser had discussed coordinating regionally on when to lift restrictions on elective surgeries.   “We want to be consistent because what we don’t want to happen is, if we do it sooner in one state than the other, then individuals will go to other states to have their surgery done,” Northam said.   Northam said Virginia does not meet the criteria to start even the first phase of the White House plan. To do so, the state would need its number of positive tests to be on a downward trend for 14 days.   “We have not met that criteria. We’re still seeing more cases each day, not fewer. So we are not there yet,” he said.   Governors in the Northeast and along the West Coast this week announced separate state compacts to coordinate how to begin reopening society amid the coronavirus pandemic. They did not announce specific plans on how to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses. Instead, both groups said they would coordinate those decisions while first considering the health of residents.   Although Hogan, Northam and Bowser have not been as formal in announcing a compact, they have been working together for weeks. For example, the three signed a letter to President Donald Trump dated March 15, requesting that the president add the region as a priority location for a federally supported testing site.   “The National Capital Region is home to over six million residents and the seat of the federal government, with hundreds of thousands of employees and contractors serving the Department of Defense and other mission essential agencies,” the three wrote. “The health of the National Capital Region is a top priority for the continuity of our democratic government and critical to continuing federal government functions.”   For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.   ___   Associated Press writer Sarah Rankin contributed to this report in Richmond, Virginia.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan said he wants to quadruple the number of workers in the state doing contact tracing for patients who test positive for the coronavirus.  Contact tracing involves a worker re-tracing the steps of someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and warning those with whom the patient may have had contact that they may have been exposed.   The moment someone tests positive, a disease investigator will go back in time, contacting people who may have had contact with them at the grocery store, pharmacy, the bank or even at home.   Health workers are using phone calls and even social media to track those who have tested positive.

(WJZ) —  A company in Frederick is developing new technology that disinfects and decontaminates face masks.  Doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients have no choice but to reuse their N95 masks during this pandemic, putting them at risk of getting the virus themselves.   So, InPro Technologies President Eric Couch and his team — including his brother and dad — decided to do something about it.   “The fact that they can’t have the necessary (personal protective equipment) to do their jobs is unacceptable,” Couch said.   Over the last week and a half, they’ve been designing and building a machine that disinfects the masks in about a minute or less using the power of UV technology.   “It could be running batches through a conveyorized system like ours exposed to UV energy that can inactivate the coronavirus,” Couch said.

(WJZ) —  Maryland schools will remain closed through May 15. Officials said they would continue to evaluate the moving situation before making an ultimate decision about schools closing.  “After extensive consultation with the State Board of Education and leading public health experts in the state. I am extending the closure of schools, through May 15,” State Schools Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon said Friday.   Salmon addressed Maryland parents, students and teachers during Gov. Larry Hogan’s press conference.   CORONAVIRUS LATEST:     Gov.

DC officials closed the district schools early on May 29  and moved to online learning through the remainder of the year.   Maryland schools have been closed since March 13 and Salmon previously announced schools would remain closed until April 24.   “In a very short timeframe school systems have continued to increase their digital presence and capabilities to provide learning opportunities to all students all school systems must submit these continuity of learning plans to the Maryland State Department of Education for review,” Salmon said.   Salmon had previously made that announcement  during a school board meeting earlier this week. The plans must include their distance learning platform, the technology they have available and how the students who don’t have access to the device or the internet will learn.   The plans will also describe the roles and responsibilities of school administrators, instructional assistants, students, and parents. They must also describe how their school system plans to address equity, including special education, English learners, homeless students, students with academic needs and gifted students. They must also determine how teachers and staff will continue professional development and what resources will be available to students and teachers.   “We are helping school systems, obtain these resources such as additional devices platforms for learning and expanded broadband capabilities that they need to carry out their plans in equitable and meaningful ways,” Salmon said. “We are hopeful that the additional $207 million in funding from the federal CARES ACT, 90% of which will go directly to local school systems, will help address gaps and the availability of these resources.”   Any lost instructional time may end up being made up over the summer.   “State and local school officials are preparing for a number of scenarios, depending on when our educators and students would be able to reenter school buildings,” she added.   Salmon said the uncertainty has created anxiety across the school communities, especially for high school seniors.   “We want seniors and their families to have an opportunity to recognize their wonderful accomplishments from their time in high school and receive their diplomas,” she added. “I will let you know that local superintendents have been working on a number of creative alternatives to ensure our high school seniors receive the recognition they deserve.”   Baltimore County elementary school teacher and Maryland State Education Association (MSEA) President Cheryl Bost released the following statement:   “This is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators, and state. Educators will continue to do our best for our students as together we navigate the challenges of crisis distance learning. We know that this type of learning is no substitute for in-person learning, and we will need to be thoughtful and serious about how we help students recover from this crisis. Recent weeks have magnified existing inequities—whether of technology access, food security, or otherwise—that our students face every day and that challenge their ability to succeed in school. We must come together to address these issues over the short- and long-term. Everyone’s safety is paramount, but we remain hopeful that educators and students will be able to spend time together again at their schools before this school year is over.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

They want the governor to reopen Maryland by May 1.   “We are the strongest country on the planet and have put a man on the moon, there is no compelling reason why we can’t protect the sick and vulnerable and get our economy back to work,” a Facebook event says.

Consuming that extra scoop of ice cream or another handful of chips or cookies, however, can cause feelings of guilt — and even more stress — along with fatigue and irritability from sugar highs and lows.   Yet the opposite is also true: Consuming healthy mood-boosting foods can deliver important brain nutrients while positively impacting your well-being.   Below are some nutritious and delicious foods that can improve your frame of mind while helping you avoid the #quarantine15 and other related health issues.   Healthy, mood-boosting comfort foods   We know that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish — particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — play an important role in brain development. But these fats may also play a role in our mental health, too. In one meta-analysis involving 26 studies and over 150,000 participants, researchers found that consuming high amounts of fatty fish may help  protect us from depression .   Another study examining the mechanisms by which omega-3s work concluded that while many factors may contribute to a rise in depression, “dietary recommendations suggesting proper intake of  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  … can result in substantial benefits for the general population.”   “Those who consume ample amounts of the omega-3 fat DHA are less prone to depression, aggressiveness and hostility,” according to registered dietitian Elizabeth Somer, author of “Food and Mood” and medical advisory board member for Persona Nutrition.   The healthy fat “helps form healthy membranes that easily transport nutrients into brain cells, lowers inflammation and raises serotonin levels,” Somer added. Serotonin is one of the key neurotransmitters influencing our mood, so incorporating plenty of DHA in your diet can help you maintain a balanced outlook.   Somer recommends aiming for at least two servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel or sardines, or looking for foods fortified with the omega-3 DHA. For a tasty way to enjoy omega-3 fats, check out my simple salmon recipe below.   Green veggies: spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts   These green veggies are a source of folate, a B vitamin that’s essential for the body’s production of serotonin, according to Somer.   In one meta-analysis, researchers found that  individuals with depression consume less folate  and have lower blood levels of the vitamin compared to those without depression.   In addition to increasing the risk for depression, poor intake of folate is also linked to fatigue and poor memory.   Somer recommends consuming at least 400 micrograms of folate per day, an amount found in 1 ½ cups of sautéed spinach. Beans, peas, lentils, avocado and strawberries are other good sources of folate.   Probiotics: yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi   You may have heard a lot about probiotics and their role in keeping our digestive tract healthy, but recent research suggests that probiotics may also play a role in keeping up our spirits. One study found that  probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts  associated with sad moods, and it suggested that probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for depression.   Probiotics can help  alleviate depressive symptoms , according to another recent review involving 10 studies. There is a need, however, for more research to determine the ideal duration of treatment, dosage and strain of probiotics to achieve better mental health.   One of the easiest ways to enjoy a daily dose of probotics is to consume a cup of low-fat yogurt with fresh fruit or a smoothie with yogurt as a snack.   Whole grains: oats, brown rice, whole wheat bread   Whole grains are rich in B vitamins that are important for energy and optimal brain health. Thanks to their fiber content, whole grains also help to keep blood sugar from spiking and crashing, which can help you avoid mood swings.   “If you’re eating bread, reach for the whole wheat over the white, since it also stabilizes blood sugar levels,” Somer said. “Refined grains found in white bread can send you on a blood sugar roller coaster, leaving you jittery, grumpy and hungry.”   Carbohydrates including whole grains also boost levels of serotonin, the “feel-good brain chemical,” according to Somer. Adding some protein, like chicken, legumes, fish or nut butter with whole grains can help, too, as protein triggers the release of norepinephrine, a brain chemical that provides an energy and mood lift.   A whole grain bagel with peanut butter, for example, can make for a nutritious mini-meal. Somer also likes whole grain crackers or bread sticks with low-fat cheese.   Vitamin D: Egg yolks, fatty fish; fortified milks   We’ve talked about vitamin D and its relation to bone health and immunity, but research has also revealed a connection between vitamin D and mental health. In one recent meta-analysis involving over 30,000 people, those with  low vitamin D levels  were more likely to be depressed.   Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with  low moods  and poor cognitive performance in older adults.   Our bodies synthesize vitamin D from the sun’s ultraviolet light, so most of us can meet at least some of our D needs during sunnier months. Certain factors including darker skin and air pollution, however, can reduce the ability of the sun to produce vitamin D in human skin, according to Dr. Michael Holick, an expert on Vitamin D research from Boston University.   So in the wintertime, it’s especially important to seek out vitamin D-rich foods, like fatty fish, eggs and fortified foods and beverages, or vitamin D supplements.   Yes, dark chocolate (in moderation)   This sweet treat can definitely give us a mood boost. Chocolate contains caffeine and  theobromine, a compound that may affect mood . The popular indulgence may also boost serotonin levels.   What’s more, dark chocolate also contains  healthful flav a nols  that have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and improve cognition.   To keep weight in check, limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily, or about 150 calories.   Coffee and tea   Coffee and tea are sources of caffeine, which can give us a lift.   “When we consume caffeine, it has positive effects on mood and alertness, and people like these beneficial effects,” said Mary M. Sweeney, an instructor who researches caffeine’s effects on individuals in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.   One  meta-analysis  revealed that consuming coffee (and tea) may help protect against depression.   Just keep in mind that people vary in their tolerance to caffeine. “Many people consume caffeine without negative consequences, but for some individuals, either regularly consuming too much caffeine or consuming too much at once can cause distress,” Sweeney said.   Green tea has less caffeine than coffee, is a rich source of the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG, and also contains the amino acid theanine, which may help  reduce stress  and  promote calm feelings .

Mood-boosting recipes   Mustard-crusted salmon with roasted green beans and shallots  (from my book, “ The Beauty Diet “)   Total time: 45 minutes   Nonstick cooking spray   1 pound green beans, trimmed   2 shallots, sliced   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil   1⁄2 teaspoon kosher salt   1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   4 6-ounce wild salmon fillets   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard   2 teaspoons honey   Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the green beans, and boil for 3–5 minutes or until bright green and slightly tender. Drain and run under cold water until cool.

Larry Hogan said at a press conference Friday:   “Some people have said that covering their faces infringes on their rights. But this isn’t just about your rights or protecting yourself. It’s about protecting your neighbors, and the best science that we have shows that people might not know that they’re carriers of the virus, and through no fault of their own, they could infect other people, and spreading this disease infringes on your neighbor’s rights.”   Shoppers at the Giant Foods store in Hampden Saturday said they felt like the measure was an appropriate step to take   “It’s like washing your hands or putting on clothes when it’s cold, it’s the same thing we do any time to preserve our own health,” said Eric Thomas.   “I think it’s an awesome idea to try to keep the virus down,” Scharon Dickerson said.

Testing nationwide is currently at 150,000 per day, they said, adding that “If we can’t be doing at least 500,000 tests a day by May 1, it is hard to see any way we can remain open.”   The US has reported more than 735,000 coronavirus cases and 39,090 deaths, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University . Though some officials have warned against it, several states are looking to reopen as soon as possible.   The research on the testing shortfall was done by Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, Dr. Thomas Tsai, researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Benjamin Jacobson, research assistant at the Harvard Global Health Institute.   And the number of positive tests much also be much lower, the researchers said. In the US, 20% of those tested for coronavirus get positive results. The World Health Organization has said that to reopen, that number should be between 3% to 12%.   In a three-part guideline released last week, the White House said states can enter the first phase toward reopening once they see a continued decrease over two weeks. Experts have long said one of the major determining factors behind governors’ decisions to reopen their economies should be testing.   Testing is crucial to determine who’s infected and a risk to others.   Contamination delayed tests   The US is currently lacking the testing capacity critical to reopening, and the roll out of tests was stalled from the start of the national outbreak.   That delay stemmed from contamination in manufacturing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coronavirus test, multiple health officials told CNN. Part of that contamination came from the CDC not adhering to its own protocols, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. It said the test was made in a CDC laboratory instead of one of its manufacturing facilities, which is not consistent with its protocol.   “Routine quality control measures aim to identify these types of issues. Those measures were not sufficient in this circumstance, and CDC implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing this issue moving forward,” CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said.   States easing restrictions   Some states are already taking steps to begin reopening, though the changes are gradual and limited mostly to outdoor activities.   In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster is expected to announce Monday that he lifted restrictions on beach access and retail stores, according to a report from The Post and Courier newspaper in Charleston. In Florida, residents flocked to Jacksonville beaches after officials announced a soft opening Friday night allowing for recreational activities for several hours each day.   But Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said the openings do not mean the area is done flattening the curve but provide a responsible way to exercise outdoors.   Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Friday easing some measures next week — ordering state parks to reopen by Monday but directing residents to wear face coverings, keep a distance and stay in groups of five people or less. The state has more than 18,000 reported infections.   Abbott said the process of reopening the state will happen gradually and will be guided by medical experts.   In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz signed an order allowing many outdoor activities — including golfing, boating, hunting and biking — to resume Saturday morning, as long as residents follow social distancing guidelines, avoid crowded spaces and stay close to home.   “The only way this is going to work even with something like golf or shooting ranges or trails, is if we follow those, washing our hands, stay home (guidelines). If you’re sick, cough into your sleeve, wear a mask.” Walz said Friday.   Protests over orders   Meanwhile, some residents are taking to the streets demanding an end to stay-at-home orders over concerns of the economic impact.   Hundreds gathered in front of the Texas State Capitol in Austin Saturday for a “You Can’t Close America” rally. While, in New Hampshire, a crowd formed outside the State House, urging Gov. Chris Sununu to lift emergency orders.   In Indianapolis, protesters gathered outside the home of Gov. Eric Holcomb to protest his stay-at-home order, which has been extended until May 1. People in cars paraded through Annapolis, Maryland, honking their horns and holding signs asking Gov. Larry Hogan to lift restrictions.   More are planned for the coming days, including in Wisconsin, Kansas and Missouri.   Ben Dorr, who organized the group Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine, told CNN affiliate WFRV he fears economic destruction.   “Hundreds of thousands of workers are out of work. Hundreds and thousands of small family businesses are being destroyed right now under this quarantine, under this lockdown,” Dorr told the news station.

But for those with hypertension, “Covid will cause a systemic reaction in the body in a patient that already has risk” because of poor heart health, she said. That means the virus can attack multiple organ systems.   The CDC’s  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report  from February 12 to March 28 showed that 9% of Covid-19 patients in the United States also self-reported a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.   High blood pressure is the most common type of heart disease and affects almost half of all American adults,  according to the CDC . That’s about 108 million Americans living with the condition.   And because hypertension is more common as people grow older, that means many of the same people with high blood pressure already overlap with the elderly population s  known to be at higher risk for contracting Covid-19.   Recognize the warning signs and know how to take your blood pressure   At a basic anatomic level, hypertension happens when there’s an abnormality in blood vessels that can impair the way oxygen is transferred to the cells.   Having a low blood oxygen level is common among those hospitalized with Covid-19, according to a study of patients in Wuhan, China published in  the Lancet  in January.   “High blood pressure is not [just] a number. The number is a guide, it’s a symbol,” Delgado-Lelievre said. “It’s telling us your vessels all over the body are not working as they should.”   High blood pressure  may not come  with noticeable symptoms, so the best way to identify it is to simply do a blood pressure reading.   To do that, first make sure you have a blood pressure cuff. Today’s technology is accurate enough that using a digital wrist cuff can get a good blood pressure reading, Delgado-Lelievre said.   Next, rest in a sturdy chair for at least five minutes, making sure to sit with your back straight. Keep your forearms supported on a flat surface such as a table, and keep the blood pressure cuff placed directly above where your elbow bends.   As you’re monitoring blood pressure over time, make sure to take the readings at the same time every day.   Any blood pressure reading of 120 over 80 is considered elevated, Delgado-Lelievre said.   Moving up from that point, the first level of hypertension is defined as 130 or higher for systolic (the top number) and 80 or higher for diastolic (the lower number), according to the American Heart Association.   Maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep taking your medicine   During the pandemic, the best way those with hypertension can manage their own risk is to follow the same guidelines as everyone else: maintain social distancing, wash hands frequently and refrain from touching one’s face.   More specific to high blood pressure, it’s important to try to relax as much as possible, as stress commonly drives up readings.   With so much of society upended by social distancing and the threat of more infections, relaxing is obviously easier said than done. But do as well as you can to try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.   Although hypertension is a genetic disease, it has external drivers such as lifestyle, diet and exercise.   Delgado-Lelievre said she often tells patients that if they come up with an unusually high blood pressure reading they should try relaxation exercises, or lie down and listen to music. Then they should take their blood pressure again, and they will likely see a drop.   “Some people already know they have hypertension and know they need to monitor their blood pressure two or three times a week,” she added.   And despite some recent rumors to the contrary, doctors  still recommend  taking medications your doctor may have prescribed for blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the American Heart Association says.   “Do not stop your medications unless your doctor tells you to,” Delgado-Lelievre said.   The African American community is at higher risk   It’s not just adults over 60; African Americans are also at a higher risk for hypertension,  according to  a study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   US Surgeon General Jerome Adams told “CBS Sunday Morning” that he has high blood pressure, noting “I have heart disease, and I and many black Americans are at higher risk for Covid,” he said.   CNN political commentator Van Jones  echoed Adams .   “All the doctors are saying: people who have high blood pressure and hypertension are very at risk to dying when they get this virus,” Jones said. “Nobody is saying that to the black community loudly enough.”   For groups more likely to have co-morbid conditions or other risk factors, including African Americans and the elderly, Jones had blunt advice.   “What that means is if your grandmother has high blood pressure or diabetes, grab her and pull her into the house and do not let her out for two months,” he said.   “Those with hypertension have to be very cautious about maintaining the quarantine,” Delgado-Lelievre added.

(WJZ) —  During an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union show Sunday morning, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump’s claim that states have enough COVID-19 tests to reopen is “not accurate.”  During a White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference Saturday afternoon, President Trump said that COVID-19 testing capabilities and capacities are “fully sufficient” to begin opening up the country.   Gov. Hogan said he believes the Trump Administration is trying to ramp up testing, but that governors across the country still don’t have sufficient capabilities.   “To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” Hogan said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests. Not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America, and from all across the world.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Gov. Hogan said that Maryland has increased its COVID-19 testing by 5,000 percent over the past month, but that it’s “nowhere near where it needs to be.”     President Trump’s claim that states have enough tests to reopen “is just absolutely false,” says Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. “It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done. That’s just not being straightforward.”  #CNNSOTU   pic.twitter.com/0K48hRAgzI   — State of the Union (@CNNSotu)  April 19, 2020     “There are things like shortages on swabs that we don’t have anywhere in America, yet you can’t do the tests without, reagents which is a part of the test,” Hogan said. “I think they’ve made some strides at the federal level, I think states are all working hard on their own to find their own testing, Lab capacity has been increasing, but it’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done. That’s just not being straightforward.”   A new testing facility in Baltimore County administered just 30 tests on Thursday because that was all they could get.   “I would have loved to have this up much sooner, but we just didn’t have the tests available,” said Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr.   This is the second day of a decline in Maryland’s reported number of cases. There are 12,830 confirmed cases and 486 confirmed deaths as of Sunday morning, an increase of 522 from Saturday.   The governor signed an executive order Sunday  expediting the release of hundreds of men and women from state correctional institutions  and over the weekend his mandate  requiring masks or face coverings  inside retail stores or while riding public transit went into effect.   “The wearing of masks is also something that we may all have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.   Cloth masks, homemade masks and bandannas all meet the governor’s requirements. Anyone who knowingly violates the governor’s order could receive a year in jail or a $5,000 fine, or both.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Saturday to expedite the release of hundreds of inmates in Maryland correctional institutions in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The executive order expedites the release of inmates in Maryland correctional institutions who were already eligible to be released within the next four months, and the processing of inmates eligible for home detention.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Hogan’s executive order, said, in part:   “In order to reduce the threat to health, welfare, and safety caused by rapid transmission of COVID-19 between residents and staff in congregative correctional custody, and enable social distancing and other mitigation efforts, certain inmates must be removed from these facilities. “   The executive order also said that, “It is in public interest to prevent inmates’ exposure to the novel coronavirus by expeditiously moving them to alternative places of confinement, such as in supervised community placement or their homes.”   On April 16, 2020, there were 136 confirmed cases of the coronavirus within the Maryland correctional system, and one death was reported.   Members of Maryland’s federal Congressional delegation wrote a letter to Gove. Larry Hogan Thursday urging him to take “aggressive actions” to stop the fast spread of COVID-19 through the state’s prison system.   “We are concerned that an outbreak of COVID-19 within Maryland’s correctional system would endanger the health of all—surrounding communities, correctional staff, first responders and inmates,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge you to strongly consider the recommendations of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh that you exercise your commutation power by working with the Maryland Parole Commission to identify and accelerate the release of inmates who pose little risk to public safety but whose continued incarceration would increase the risk of an outbreak amongst the state’s prison population. This action will not only protect correctional officers, first responders, and inmates, but also our state at large.”   Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who pushed for the supervised release of some non-violent inmates at correctional facilities across the state, said released the following statement:   “This is a victory for public health, public safety, and common sense. We applaud the Governor for taking these important steps and are pleased to see him incorporate many of the recommendations we made in a proposal we sent around a month ago. We stand ready to work with his office on implementing his plan, and will continue to develop our own policies. These actions will prevent more deaths among incarcerated people, correctional staff, and Marylanders as a whole.”   There are now more than 12,800 coronavirus cases and nearly 500 deaths in Maryland, according to new data released Sunday morning.

Liam St. John tells WJZ his mother Evelyn Caro was born to help others.   “My mom made the business of ‘caring’ her life’s work and I can’t think of a better way to honor than to share her story,” St. John said.   Caro was a nurse for 19 years. She called her son around March 26 saying she had a fever. Her symptoms began to worsen.   “We were throwing the supplies up her balcony so she could get to them and one of them was a device to measure how much oxygen was getting to her hands,” he said.

After a few days at Howard General, Caro was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital.   “She lost function to her right lung, she had an infection raging, fever spiking — they were doing everything they could,” said St. John, who was able to visit her one last time.   “On Saturday, April 11, my mom passed away in the ICU at Johns Hopkins,” St. John said.   Her grandchildren were not able to say goodbye.   St. John said his mom raised three boys on her own, she was known as abuela to her grandchildren and she fought the coronavirus until the end.   As St. John reflected on his mother’s legacy, as a nurse himself, he pleaded with the public to stay home.   “I really need the public to understand the cost of selfish actions, maybe you don’t get sick, but maybe you give it to somebody else,” he said, as he expressed that many people are not allowed to visit their dying family members in hospitals around the country.   “Please don’t give up on this fight too early,” he said.   St. Johns works at Mercy Hospital and said he’s hoping hospitals can somehow start getting virtual messages to patients.   He said when they wake up, he hopes they see messages of love and hope from family, friends, church groups, local heroes, anyone who can share a positive moment instead of being surrounded by machines.

Since it was first observed in 2019, the comet has been streaming across our solar system and the heat of our sun has caused it to shed gas. Within that gas and the melting bits of the comet is information, some of which could be millions or even billions of years old.   In December, astronomers ensured that telescopes in space and on the ground were oriented to observe the comet’s closest approach to Earth. It passed within 190 million miles of Earth, shedding more gas and dust evaporating through its cometary tail.   This close (for a comet) pass was observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of telescopes in Chile, known as ALMA.   “This is the first time we’ve ever looked inside a comet from outside our solar system,” said Martin Cordiner, astrochemist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and an author of one of two studies on the comet that published Monday.   “And it is dramatically different from most other comets we’ve seen before,” he said in a statement.   Astronomers could identify the gas streaming from the comet, which contained an unusually high amount of carbon monoxide — more than has been identified in a comet within two times the distance from the Earth to the sun, according to the study published in the journal  Nature Astronomy . This suggests that the comet may have formed under different circumstances than those in our own solar system.   A second study about the nature of the carbon monoxide also published Monday in  Nature Astronomy .   The amount of carbon monoxide is thought to be between nine and 26 times greater than the average comet in our solar system.   The also detected hydrogen cyanide, which was expected and the amount was similar to that found our solar system’s comets.   ALMA observed hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN, left) and carbon monoxide gas (CO, right) coming out of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov. The ALMA images show that the comet contains an unusually large amount of CO gas. ALMA is the first telescope to measure the gases originating directly from the nucleus of an object that travelled to us from another planetary system. Credit: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO), M. Cordiner & S. Milam; NRAO/AUI/NSF, S. Dagnello   “The comet must have formed from material very rich in [carbon monoxide] ice, which is only present at the lowest temperatures found in space, below -420 degrees Fahrenheit (-250 degrees Celsius),” said Stefanie Milam, study co-author and planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, in a statement.   Carbon monoxide is common in comets, but the amount appears to vary.   Astronomers believe this variation might be due to the particular region where the comet was formed, or how often a comet is brought closer to a star due to its orbit. This closer approach causes it to melt and shed elements that evaporate easily.   “If the gases we observed reflect the composition of 2I/Borisov’s birthplace, then it shows that it may have formed in a different way than our own solar system comets, in an extremely cold, outer region of a distant planetary system,” said Cordiner. This region can be compared to the cold region of icy bodies beyond Neptune, called the Kuiper Belt.   Comets can uniquely preserve information about how they were formed because most of the time, they’re far away from stars and cold enough that they remain unchanged.   For now, astronomers don’t know what kind of star the comet orbited before being kicked out of its solar system and sent into ours. Astronomers suspect the eviction occurred when the comet interacted with the gravity of its host star or a giant planet in the system.   It’s been traveling on its own, for millions or billions of years, and then entered our solar system and was spotted in  August 2019 .   So where did it come from?   The comets in our solar system are leftovers from the material that makes planets, which was found in a protoplanetary disk around our sun.   The ALMA group of telescopes can observe disks around younger versions of stars similar to our sun.   These protoplanetary disks contain gas and dust where planets pull together and form — and leftover pieces of this gas, dust and ice form comets. So it’s possible that the star this comet orbited was a younger version of our sun.   And the melting elements from the comet tell us what could be found in a protoplanetary disk around a star in another solar system.   “ALMA has been instrumental in transforming our understanding of the nature of cometary material in our own solar system — and now with this unique object coming from our next door neighbors,” said Anthony Remijan, study co-author and at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, in a statement.   “It is only because of ALMA’s unprecedented sensitivity at submillimeter wavelengths that we are able to characterize the gas coming out of such unique objects.”   This is only the second interstellar object to cross into our solar system after  ‘Oumuamua  was spotted in 2017. Astronomers didn’t have long to observe it, and it was classified as an interstellar asteroid.   But 2I/Borisov is with us for longer. And its signature cometary tail gave it away as an interstellar comet.   The comet won’t remain in our solar system, despite the gravity of our sun, because it’s zipping along at 100,000 miles per hour. By June 2020, the comet will be well past Jupiter and on its way back to interstellar space.   “2I/Borisov gave us the first glimpse into the chemistry that shaped another planetary system,” said Milam.   “But only when we can compare the object to other interstellar comets, will we learn whether 2I/Borisov is a special case, or if every interstellar object has unusually high levels of CO (carbon monoxide).”   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Maybe you’ve noticed.  April 20, or 4/20, is known as “ Weed Day ” in some circles because the date corresponds with a numerical code for  marijuana .   Yes, it seems arbitrary. So how did the number 420 come to represent smoking pot?   First, let’s get the myths and rumors out of the way:   The legend of the California penal code   Some claim the number is drawn from the  California criminal codes  used to punish the use or distribution of marijuana. But the state’s 420 code actually applies to obstructing entry on public land. So, not quite.   But the rumor sounds a lot like …   The legend of the police radio code   Neither LAPD nor NYPD even have a code 420. San Francisco Police have one, but it’s for a “juvenile disturbance.”   So never mind that theory.   Then there’s …   The legend of the Dylan song   This one is a nod to  Bob Dylan’s  song, “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35” and its lyric, “Everybody must get stoned.”   Multiply 12 by 35 and you get 420.   Seems a bit of a stretch. And Dylan himself has never confirmed any link.   The story that appears to hold the most water is …   The legend of the Waldos   According to Chris Conrad, curator of the  Oaksterdam Cannabis Museum  in Oakland, California, 420 started as a secret code among high schoolers in the early 1970s.   A group of friends at San Rafael High School in Marin County, California, who called themselves “the Waldos,” would often meet at 4:20 p.m. to get high.   For them, it was an ideal time: They were out of school but their parents still weren’t home, giving them a window of unsupervised freedom. They met at that time every day near a statue of Louis Pasteur, the scientist who pioneered pasteurization.   CNN Money: 10 things to know about legal pot   The 4:20 time became a code for them to use in front of their unsuspecting parents, and 420 gradually spread from there —  possibly via Grateful Dead followers  — across California and beyond. It’s even the number of a California Senate bill that established the state’s medial marijuana program.   What was shorthand for a group of friends can now be seen on T-shirts and throughout pop culture.   And of course, on the calendar every April.

(WJZ) —  The chairman of the Maryland Republican Party is calling for the chief of staff of the state’s comptroller to be fired over controversial comments he made on social media.  Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot’s chief of staff Len Foxwell Saturday responded to criticism of the controversial Facebook post in which he wrote that members of a right-wing group opposed to stay-at-home orders and other coronavirus-related restrictions should be put in a warehouse “and then let Darwin work his magic.”   Foxwell, who joined Franchot’s office in 2007,  according to his biography  with the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum where he’s a board member, shared a link to an article on Monday about a group called “The Patriot Movement” calling on people to defy coronavirus-related orders.  In the post , he wrote:   “Let’s lure them into a big, big warehouse (we’ll call it something real classy to suit their refined sensibilities, like “America MAGA Platinum Palace”) with the promise of all the unfiltered Camels they can smoke, all the Salisbury steak and banana moonpies they can eat, washed down by all the Old Crow and Icehouse they can drink.   “Plus, autographs from Scott Baio and pics with Tawny Kitean, posing all sexy and everything on a sportscar, just like in that old Whitesnake video! Get them in, bar the door and then let Darwin work his magic.”   As of Monday, Foxwell submitted his resignation from the board of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.   The post drew backlash online, with multiple commenters calling for Foxwell to be fired.   Maryland Republican Party chairman Dirk Haire also called on Franchot to fire Foxwell.   “I hope you agree with me that Mr. Foxwell’s statements suggesting the genocide of President Trump’s supporters are extraordinarily inappropriate and representative of a base and destructive mindset. A review of Mr. Foxwell’s Facebook page shows many similar posts by Mr. Foxwell,” Haire wrote.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     On Saturday, Foxwell wrote that his comments were made “in a typical spirit of sarcasm and jest” and were not directed at supporters of President Donald Trump but rather at the leaders and members of the group:   “Again, this had nothing to do with rank-and-file Trump supporters – notwithstanding my deep, searing distaste for the President’s politics and his catastrophic mismanagement of this crisis. Nor, obviously, did I ever express hope that someone would die. Any suggestions to the contrary are simply, absolutely false. By now, it’s fairly obvious that, like so many other social media brush fires that revolve around this President, a handful of provocateurs twisted unrelated content to suit their narrative of victimization and government persecution.”     Saturday night, Franchot said he stands behind Foxwell:   “It has never been my policy to comment on social media content posted by members of my staff, so long as it is done on their own time. I won’t start now. Suffice to say, however, that I remain 100 percent supportive of Len Foxwell and the exceptional work he continues to do for me and for the people of Maryland. He is an exceptional public servant, a dear family friend, and I look forward to his continued service as my Chief of Staff for years to come.”     Foxwell’s latest post came just hours after protesters filled the streets of Annapolis, calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to remove some restrictions the state put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The city of Annapolis had been warning residents and business owners that traffic could be bad downtown due to another protest scheduled for Monday. They have since deleted the tweet.   According to the city, it was supposed to be the same “Reopen Maryland” group that protested over the weekend, but the Reopen Maryland group said it’s not them.   “There have been reports of a demonstration tomorrow in Annapolis to protest the state’s shutdown and lockdown orders, the group said on its page. “#ReOpenMaryland is NOT hosting, sponsoring or endorsing any protest events in Annapolis.”     Ron Furman of Max’s Tap House in Annapolis closed his business last month. His employees have been on furlough.   Furman spoke in favor of the stay-at-home order and restrictions closing numerous businesses like his.   “Every time you go out, you run the risk of bringing it home,” he said. “We need to be able to test the population and track those that have it. Those are answers that we need to open the economy back up.”   While it’s inconvenient, he urged people to listen to experts calling for closures to stay in place for now.   “(Staying home is) what the experts have been telling us and I think we need to listen,” Furman said. “I need to make sure (our employees) are gonna be safe.”   Over the weekend, Reopen Maryland protested the closure of many non-essential businesses due to the coronavirus pandemic with a parade of cars honking near State Circle. Many had signs or writing on their cars to share their stories.   They called on Gov. Larry Hogan to remove some restrictions the state has put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus.   “#ReopenMaryland did sponsor a successful, well-attended, law-abiding protest on Saturday, 18 April 2020, in which numerous Marylanders peacefully exercised their constitutional rights. #ReopenMaryland is committed to peaceful and law-abiding advocacy,” the group said.

The two-night premiere of “The Gene” will air on April 7th and 14th at 8/7c on PBS. To learn more about the best-selling book that inspired the documentary, read this special selection from  Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee’s “The Gene: An Intimate History,”  available now from CBS sister company Simon & Schuster.     [ The Gene: An Intimate History ] is the story of the birth, growth, and future of one of the most powerful and dangerous ideas in the history of science: the “gene,” the fundamental unit of heredity, and the basic unit of all biological information.     I use that last adjective— dangerous —with full cognizance. Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by an earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. Each begins its life as a rather abstract scientific concept, but grows to invade multiple human discourses—thereby transforming culture, society, politics, and language. But the most crucial parallel between the three ideas, by far, is conceptual: each represents the irreducible unit—the building block, the basic organizational unit—of a larger whole: the atom, of matter; the byte (or “bit”), of digitized information; the gene, of heredity and biological information.     Why does this property—being the least divisible unit of a larger form—imbue these particular ideas with such potency and force? The simple answer is that matter, information, and biology are inherently hierarchically organized: understanding that smallest part is crucial to under- standing the whole. When the poet Wallace Stevens writes, “In the sum of the parts, there are only the parts,” he is referring to the deep structural mystery that runs through language: you can only decipher the meaning of a sentence by deciphering every individual word—yet a sentence carries more meaning than any of the individual words. And  so  it is with genes. An organism is much more than its genes, of course, but to under- stand an organism, you must first understand its genes. When the Dutch biologist Hugo de Vries encountered the concept of the gene in the 1890s, he quickly intuited that the idea would reorganize our understanding of the natural world. “The whole organic world is the result of innumerable different combinations and permutations of relatively few factors . . . .  Just as physics and chemistry go back to molecules and atoms, the biological sciences have to penetrate these units [genes] in order to explain . . . the phenomena of the living world.”     The atom, the byte, and the gene provide fundamentally new scientific and technological understandings of their respective systems. You cannot explain the behavior of matter—why gold gleams; why hydrogen combusts with oxygen—without invoking the atomic nature of matter. Nor can you understand the complexities of computing—the nature of algorithms, or the storage or corruption of data—without comprehending the structural anatomy of digitized information. “Alchemy could not become chemistry until its fundamental units were discovered,” a nineteenth-century scientist wrote. By the same token, as I argue in this book, it is impossible to understand organismal and cellular biology or evolution—or human pathology, behavior,  temperament, illness, race, and identity or fate—without first reckoning with the concept of the gene.     There is a second issue at stake here. Understanding atomic science was a necessary precursor to manipulating matter (and, via the manipulation of matter, to the invention of the atomic bomb). Our understanding of genes has allowed us to manipulate organisms with unparalleled dexterity and power. The actual nature of the genetic code, it turns out, is astoundingly simple: there’s just one molecule that carries our hereditary information and just one code. “That the fundamental aspects of heredity should have turned out to be so extraordinarily simple supports us in the hope that nature may, after all, be entirely approachable,” Thomas Morgan, the influential geneticist, wrote. “Her much-advertised inscrutability has once more been found to be an illusion.”     Our understanding of genes has reached such a level of sophistication and depth that we are no longer studying and altering genes in test tubes, but in their native context in human cells. Genes reside on chromosomes—long, filamentous structures buried within cells that contain tens of thousands of genes linked together in chains. Humans have forty-six such chromosomes in total—twenty-three from one parent and twenty-three from another. The entire set of genetic instructions carried by an organism is termed a  genome  (think of the genome as the encyclopedia of all genes, with footnotes, annotations, instructions, and references). The human genome contains about between twenty-one and twenty-three thousand genes that provide the master instructions to build, repair, and maintain humans. Over the last two decades, genetic technologies have advanced so rapidly that we can decipher how several of these genes op-  erate  in time and space to enable these complex functions. And we can, on occasion, deliberately alter some of these genes to change their functions, thereby resulting in altered human states, altered physiologies, and changed beings.     This transition—from explanation to manipulation—is precisely what makes the field of genetics resonate far beyond the realms of science. It is one thing to try to understand how genes influence human identity or sexuality or temperament. It is quite another thing to imagine altering identity or sexuality or behavior by altering genes. The former thought might preoccupy professors in departments of psychology, and their colleagues in the neighboring departments of neuroscience. The latter thought, inflected with both promise and peril, should concern us all.     Excerpted from  The Gene: An Intimate History  by Siddhartha Mukherjee .  Copyright © 2016 by the author.

Despite the anxiety patients may face, doctors say it’s important those with serious medical conditions get the help they need before it’s too late.   Dr. Neil Roy at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore said the fear of contracting COVID-19 is pushing some people away.   “It’s actually a little bit concerning that people are having heart attacks or blood clots for their lungs and they don’t want to come to the hospital because they are worried about getting coronavirus when really they should be coming for those things,” he said.   Since the virus began spreading in Maryland, Roy said Sinai has seen a decrease in patients with non-coronavirus symptoms. That could mean patients with chest pains, broken bones or even a stroke are holding back on getting the medical help they need.

(AP) —  This year’s Scripps National Spelling Bee has been canceled after organizers concluded there is “no clear path to safely set a new date in 2020” because of the coronavirus pandemic.   The decision, announced by Scripps on Tuesday morning, means kids who are in eighth grade this year will miss their final opportunity to compete in the national finals.   Scripps will not change eligibility requirements for next year’s bee, which is scheduled for June 1-3, 2021, at its longtime venue, a convention center outside Washington. The bee has always been open to kids through the eighth grade.   “Our hearts go out to the spellers who won’t get their final shot at winning because of the pandemic and the difficult decisions it is prompting us to make,” Paige Kimble, the bee’s executive director, said in a statement.   The bee, televised by ESPN since 1994, had only previously been canceled in 1943-45 because of World War II.   The first Scripps bee was held in 1925.   Last year’s bee ended in an unprecedented eight-way tie after organizers ran out of words difficult enough to challenge the best spellers.   Scripps had announced on March 20 that this year’s bee would be postponed but did not commit to a new date.   Organizers said Tuesday they would find a way to recognize the more than 150 spellers who had already won their regional bees and qualified for the national finals.

(WJZ) —  Maryland received half a million test kits from South Korea, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday, saying his wife First Lady Yumi Hogan helped to close a deal with a laboratory there.  Hogan said he and the First Lady received the test kits Saturday morning at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. A Korean Air Boeing 777 arrived without passengers but instead with 500,000 test kits, giving Maryland the capability of increasing testing.   It was the first-ever direct flight from Seoul to Maryland.   The testing kits came from LabGenomics as a part of Operation Enduring Friendship.   Hogan recalled meeting with the South Korean president earlier this year.   “He was so proud of my wife, and he said that they considered me… a son-in-law to the Korean people, and I considered it quite an honor for him to say that that night. But I had no idea how much that would truly come to mean these two very long months later,” Hogan said.   The federal government has also purchased tests from South Korea, but this is the first sale brokered to an individual state. The tests will cost Maryland $9 million.   “$9 million to try to keep hundreds of millions of people safe and to protect thousands of lives and to get our economy back on track seems like a pretty worthwhile investment,” the governor said.     On Saturday, First Lady Yumi Hogan and I stood on the tarmac at  @BWI_Airport  to welcome the first ever Korean Air passenger plane, carrying a very important payload of LabGun  #COVID19  test kits which will give MD the capability of performing half a million coronavirus tests.  pic.twitter.com/Elf0ADIRnJ   — Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan)  April 20, 2020     The New York Times  first reported  that tests arrived after Hogan and his wife, “a Korean immigrant who speaks fluent Korean” helped secure the final deal. They started speaking to South Korea about acquiring the tests on March 28, Hogan said.   “The state of Maryland owes an incredible debt of gratitude to the people of South Korea,” the governor said. “As Maryland begins its reopening and recovery, Marylanders should feel confident knowing that we have done everything in our power and gone to every length and used every tool at our disposal to defeat this deadly virus.”   The governor credited the First Lady with helping secure the deal.   “She truly is a champion of this operation,” he said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     So far, about  71,000 coronavirus tests  have been administered in the state. Hogan said these tests will be used “right away.”   “This half a million tests is more than the four of the top five states in America have done so far in the entire COVID-19 crisis, so it’s a huge, huge step in the right direction,” Hogan said.   But the governor said they continue to search for more ways to ramp up the state’s testing capabilities.   “We’ve ramped up our labs, we’re continuing to ramp up the lab capability,” he added. “10,000 was a very aggressive goal — they’re gonna get mad at me for saying this — but I think I’m going to try to blow through that and do maybe a 200% of what their aggressive goal was and try to get up to 20,000 tests a day.”   He also made mention of comments from President Donald Trump that states should take their own initiative when it comes to finding testing supplies and other equipment.   “The (Trump) Administration made it clear over and over again that they want the states to take the lead, and we have to go out and do it ourselves, and so that’s exactly what we did,” he said.   Hogan said while expanded testing will be key to reopening Maryland, he does not want to open parts of the state piecemeal.   “Certain areas don’t have as bad of an infection rate. It may be because they haven’t done enough testing. What we don’t want is to have the neighbor next door come over if you open everything, then they’re going to be flooded with more infected folks,” he said.   Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said he salutes Gov. Hogan for his “continued strong and steady leadership, and to our extraordinary First Lady, Yumi Hogan, for her intervention and involvement in securing these much-needed and life-saving test kits.”   “The widespread use of testing conducted by the South Korean government has been cited as a chief catalyst for the sharp decline of infections in that country. ” He said in part. “Given the absence of a strong federal coordinated response, states have had to fill the void of national leadership. Fortunately here in Maryland, we have a governor who is relentless in fighting for the resources that we need to combat this pandemic effectively and to protect our citizens.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

With retailers running low, consumers are now turning to industrial suppliers. Rich Hebert is the CEO of cleanitsupply.com which sells those giant rolls to businesses.   “With the onset of the crisis, most of our customers now are residential consumers,” he said.   While the company does sell smaller sizes of toilet paper, much of it sold out. What’s left ships by the carton.   “A carton has 96 rolls,” Hebert said. “As long as they’re willing to buy in bulk and have a place to store it, we can satisfy their needs.”   Toilet paper makers have increased production, but it could be several weeks before stores can add more stock.

On Sunday, a number of neighbors and close friends honked and waved as they drove by the east Des Moines home of Murphy Stammer to make sure his special day was one to remember.   “It’s awesome just to see how many people would come out just to drive by for just a couple seconds to wave and say happy birthday,” Murphy’s mom, Mary Ann Stammer, told  WHO .   The well wishers included Murphy’s grandparents, who drove nearly 140 miles from Thayer and back to join the birthday parade.   “Oh awesome, absolutely awesome,” Murphy’s grandfather, Steve Murphy, said. “For grandkids, you have to do what you have to do. I wouldn’t have missed it.”   In accordance with social distancing rules, presents, cards and posters were dropped off near the sidewalk.   “We kept our distance and at least had a grandkid day,” Steve Murphy said.   “It was worthwhile coming up. It was great just seeing that smile on that little boy’s face. I don’t know who enjoyed it more, him or us,” he added.   Murphy’s mom said the surprise celebration provided a welcome change from the isolation.   “I’m not able to work right now because I’m a hair stylist, so to have sort of human interaction is kind of amazing and not just stuck inside,” Mary Ann Stammer said.

Now, there’s a shortage of frozen pizzas.  Americans have bought approximately $275 million worth of frozen pizza since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March. That’s an increase of 92 percent compared to the same time last year, according to  Ad Week , citing stats from data analytics firm  IRI .   “It’s incredible,” says Gina Bolger, vice president of branding for Home Run Inn Pizza, which is churning out as many as 85,000 pizzas a day at its 60,000-square-foot factory in Woodridge, Illinois.   “We equate this to every day being like Super Bowl Sunday — the orders don’t stop. The demand is through the roof. We’re trying to keep up as best we can,” she says.     How much frozen pizza are people buying?

The experts say shoppers are hoarding frozen pizza because it’s affordable, easy to make and tends to be a crowd-pleasing family favorite. Pizzas also can last a long time in the freezer, which can be helpful for a country that largely remains homebound under stay-at-home orders.   Due to the high demand, some stores are limiting the amount of frozen pizzas customers can purchase in one outing. One shopper shared an image of a Whole Foods sign warning customers that only four units of frozen pizza could be purchased in order to “support all customers.”     Limit 4 units of frozen pizza 🍕 what is this a managed futures program?  pic.twitter.com/nkKFiIVDAW   — Phillip Streible (@PStreible)  April 17, 2020     “When living in uncertain times — as many of us are right now — we’re seeing a rise in consumers turning to much-loved comfort foods,” says Ashley Lind, director of demand sciences at Celeste pizza parent Conagra Brands, whose frozen pizza business has grown by over 100 percent from this time a year ago.   “Frozen pizza checks a lot of these boxes for consumers,” he adds.

A shortstop leadoff hitter for Bishop McNamara High School since her freshman year, Greene has been waiting for her junior season to gauge the interest of college recruiters.   “I was banking on that because I really need coaches to come see me,” said Greene. “This is the year where I was like, ‘I’m going to get all these coaches to come see me and maybe I can commit this year.’ But it didn’t happen because we had no games for them to watch.”   A National Collegiate Athletic Association 2018 ruling prevented college coaches from contacting high school athletes until Sept. 1 of their junior year for softball and lacrosse. Now, with a suspended season and college applications due before the start of next season, Greene is just one example of the predicament the pandemic has caused for high school juniors hoping to take their games to the next level.   “Now, of course, a lot of that comes down to what happens this summer,” said Bishop McNamara assistant softball coach Paul O’Brien. “If she’s able to play in the summer, she’ll recover just fine. That’s a huge question mark right now.”   The timetable of returning to normalcy during this pandemic is certainly the biggest question, as college spring sports coaches typically have more time to recruit during the summer and fall, when they’re also in the offseason.   “Add on to that the (NCAA) extending the eligibility of current collegiate athletes, the junior class might be in a huge pinch as programs may not be able to financially do a ton of recruiting for that class,” O’Brien said. “So, you have five classes getting scholarship money in one form for the foreseeable future.”   While the NCAA  did allow schools to provide eligibility relief for spring sport athletes , they did so at the discretion of the schools.   For example, member Ivy League institutions have traditionally ruled against allowing graduate students to play an extra year. Schools such as Princeton, Yale and Harvard have also begun to close a loophole that would have allowed student athletes to retain their extra year of eligibility if they withdraw from this semester’s classes.   Aside from recruiting concerns, Greene said, this was likely the last opportunity for Bishop McNamara, in Forestville, Maryland, to contend for the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference state title. After coming a run short in last year’s semifinals, Greene said a large senior graduating class will likely leave the squad decimated next season.   Greene’s teammate, senior pitcher Bailey Wilcox, was only 14 strikeouts away from setting the school record — a milestone O’Brien said she would’ve completed in two games if given the opportunity.   “It really hits you there,” O’Brien said. “What these folks have been working on for the last four years is affected in a way that can’t be fixed. It’s a shame.”   The Bishop McNamara softball team is just one example of athletes all around the state missing out on chances to get recruited and achieve senior milestones.   Aaron and Andrew Ray, twins on the Loyola Blakefield high school track and field team in Towson, Maryland, were also banking on boosting their recruiting profiles. In a time-based sport that allows coaches to track down runners nationwide, Andrew said he was disappointed to not get the opportunity to improve his times before talking to college coaches.   Without another opportunity to lower his times in the 300-meter hurdles race, exclusively an outdoor event, Andrew will have to go through the college application process with his current marks.   “It’s pretty hard,” Andrew said. “I was pretty excited for this season because I feel like I was bringing everything together.”   Unlike his brother, Aaron has started talking to college coaches from schools such as Lehigh, Dartmouth and Washington and Lee. Still, with a preference of going to a larger state school such as Maryland or Penn State, the potential loss of the full spring season has forced him to become more flexible.   “It pretty much means I’ll be more open to walking-on in college if needed, especially with track and field and the way that college applications work,” Aaron said. “I might go to a college I might not have considered for track and field.”   From a coach’s perspective, Georgetown Preparatory High School, baseball coach Chris Rodriguez told Capital News Service his message to his uncommitted juniors was to stay positive and take this time to be assertive, to introduce themselves to college coaches and keep them updated on what they’re doing during the quarantine to get noticed.   “I don’t think we can do a whole lot right now other than try to be aggressive and stay in sight in some shape and form (with college coaches) that we already had connections with and try to make some new ones,” Rodriguez said. “(College coaches are) not playing either, so they’re probably in front of their computers as much as we are.”   Rodriguez, whose son Ryan is a sophomore on the varsity team, said he’s nervous about the prospect of athletes not getting a chance to compete in the summer or fall when college coaches are more focused on recruiting. Still, his message to his team has been taking this time as an opportunity to get ahead.   “You just have to find a different way to engage,” said Rodriguez, who’s also the dean of students at the Bethesda, Maryland, school. “We’re all in it together and we only have so many options, and I think it’s going to be this way for a few more months. (We’ve got to) deal with it, and get better.”   Greene has taken this time under quarantine to be proactive in contacting colleges, including an innovative way to show coaches her skills while remaining in isolation at home.   For other athletes around the state who’ve already been through the recruiting process, the potential loss of a full spring season means a missed last opportunity to leave a legacy their senior seasons.   Ryan Calvert, a senior pitcher and heavy hitter for La Plata High School in Charles County, Maryland, baseball, was touted as a potential Major League Baseball draft selection following his spring season. In light of potential financial ramifications of the postponement of the season, the MLB is discussing shortening this summer’s draft from 40 rounds to as few as five.   “It would’ve been nice to be drafted this year, but I really want to go to college and play baseball there and get my education,” Calvert said. “I’m preparing for both so I don’t want to leave any options out.”   Fortunately for Calvert, if high school sports aren’t resumed this spring, he’ll end his high school career as a state champion after leading his team to the 2A title on the mound against Middletown, in Frederick County, Maryland, last May.   “It was fun watching him grow. He’s always been big for his age but wasn’t always very athletic. To watch his athleticism catch up to his baseball IQ and ability has been a lot of fun to watch,” said La Plata head coach John Childers, who’s coached Calvert the last six years. “And to not be able to cap it off, fortunately, he got to win a state championship on the mound last year, but it’s hard for him to not to get that chance to do it again.”   Other high school athletes weren’t so fortunate to get that chance — at all.   Such was the case with Gilman High School senior Dylan Walters, who said he’s been dreaming of the chance to play No. 1 singles on the tennis team. After making varsity as a freshman, Walters has progressed up the depth chart to earn the spot his senior season.   Walters was nearly the No. 1 singles player for Gilman, in Baltimore, his junior season, but classmate Nick Boucher overcame him in the final match during tryouts. This spring, however, Walters said head coach Steve Krulevitz sat him down and said how proud he was of his hard work to secure the top spot for a team that has won the last six state titles.   “It’s a real honor to play No. 1 singles for Gilman, and I didn’t get to do that,” said Walters, who will play at Brandeis University next year. “It’s honestly devastating.”   At Baltimore’s Boys Latin High School senior lacrosse attackman Brendan Grimes hoped to get another year of crucial development before heading to play for nearby Johns Hopkins University after missing his junior season from a back injury.   “I felt that great feeling a lot coming into senior year,” Grimes said. “Unfortunately, that was taken away. For next season, to complete a full season would be great for me to get that confidence under my belt again.”   Grimes said he worked hard last year in physical therapy and did constant back and core exercises to get back into shape, something that helped him land a spot on the USA Under-19 national team roster. Now, he’s hoping to use the same patience to continue to work on his game so he’s ready for the next level.   For Ella Mannix, a senior lacrosse midfielder for Boonsboro High School headed to play at Salisbury next year, hoped-for milestones like reaching her 100th goal and making another run to the 1A championship seem all but gone with the current status of the pandemic. She said she’s been working since her freshman year to be nominated for the Player of the Year awarded by her local Hagerstown, Maryland, paper, The Herald-Mail.   Boonsboro lost in the state championship Mannix’s sophomore year before losing to the same side, Patterson Mill, in the semifinals in 2019. Mannix said she was hoping for a chance to lead her team to another postseason run.   “We had workout plans set and wanted to stay in shape so we can come back the same place we were when we got off these two weeks, but when they said the schools are being closed another four weeks it just kind of went downhill honestly,” Mannix said before it was announced schools would be closed until at least May 15. “It’s just really sad for all of us because it’s the whole season we’re missing out on that we had a lot of high hopes for.”   For high school coaches like Rodriguez and Gonzaga College High School assistant athletics director and head men’s lacrosse coach Casey O’Neil, they said it’s now about trying to maintain a positive mentality and keep in touch through weekly meetings.   Rodriguez said his assistant coaches at Georgetown Prep started a weekly baseball trivia night on Zoom, with the seniors dividing the squads into eight teams to compete. He said it’s a fun way to stay connected.   O’Neil’s Gonzaga, in Washington, D.C., has also kept in touch with weekly Zoom chats and through a workout program that each player sends out to the team, organized by jersey number.   When Gonzaga lacrosse learned their season was suspended, they were getting ready for  practice, planning to review a scout report the day before a game against rivals Georgetown Prep. After the news, O’Neil gave the seniors three options: go home right away, play an intrasquad basketball tournament, or scrimmage with teams made up of Gonzaga players from Maryland and Virginia.   The seniors chose the latter two options, taking every last minute to stay at the school with their team before leaving for a future of uncertainty.   “The guys used up all that time,” O’Neil said. “Once we played that game I had an emotional talk with them about the unknown and that they’re cared about if they need anything. They didn’t want to leave the field. They wanted to hang out and be together.”                                   ", "sentiment": 0.09506500026078343, "subjectivity": 0.44234209565534904, "wordcount": 1966}

(CBS Local)  — A restaurant owner who had to shut her doors and layoff most of her staff when the coronavirus pandemic hit Georgia has sold her car so she can pay her employees.  Vittles Restaurant  is a fixture in Smyrna, serving good old southern food for more than three decades. Charity Salyers, who purchased the restaurant last year, she says things were just picking up until the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to temporarily close.   “A lot of our clients are elderly, they come every day, sometimes twice a day, and they depend on us,” she told  WAGA .   Her loyal customers urged Salyers to do curbside pick up. But even so, business fell off sharply.   “I’ve had to cut my staff back from 10 to 12 people per day to 2 people plus me,” she said.

Now Salyers says she’s just hoping things get back to business as usual soon.   “I just pray that something happens soon and we can reopen society,” she said.

We had a great time.     MW:  Do you remember the first time you met Prince? I’m sure you do.     S.E.:  [Laughs] He remembered the first time he met me. It was either ’77 or ’78; he went to the Bay Area where I was born and raised in Oakland, California. When I met him he told me he wanted to record in this studio in this environment where Carlos Santana had recorded his albums at the time and Sly Stone. My dad was in Santana at the time and they were like there’s this young kid next door in the studio recording and playing everything himself and he’s like  ‘ wow, what’s his name ’ ,  ‘ Prince. ’   ‘ Ok. ’  He comes and plays the Bay area and I go  backstage  to meet him and put my hand out and  say,   ‘H ello my name is …’.   H e says,  ‘ I already know who you are, I’ve been following your career, you played this and this and this. I saw you on  drums’ and  he just went on and on. We exchanged numbers and that was the beginning of just a great friendship.      MW:  Wow. What impact did you have on him? And what impact would you say he had on your life as well?     S.E.:  We liked a lot of the same things, but also bringing to him my dad’s music, Latin jazz music. He had never really heard of Latin jazz before. He fell in love with the fact that I was able to play with my family, my brothers and my dad in a band. That was something he always wanted to do with his dad. He just thought that was such a blessing for me to be able to do that. I think it was a learning process in jamming in the studio and playing. I was used to recording with artists that would make sure that when I set up my drums or sometimes it would take an hour or two to get a drum sound. Oh ,  can you take this up, this is a little loud, I’m hearing a rattle and things like that. When you get in a studio with Prince, we’re barely putting the cymbal on and he’s like, ‘1, 2’. And you’re grabbing things, like wait, what? There’s no getting any sound, you just play. If that’s what the drums sound like, then that’s what they sound like. I loved that about him, we’ll do it after, let’s just get into it.     MW:  That’s really cool. You shared the stage with  a lot of artists for this special, which ones really stood out to you?   S.E.:  Everyone did. Everyone was a little bit nervous because, I want to say this to be sensitive, no one came in trying to be Prince. We didn’t do that. This is a celebration and everyone did their interpretation of how they would present his song. I think that’s a great  thing. We’re all going to do things differently so that’s one thing. Putting together the songs for the artists, some of them chose songs and we try to make arrangements that would try and help them get through the song because they’re not trying to be him. No one will be him. That’s what was so cool, coming up with these arrangements to make it a little bit different. I think they all stood out. Everyone had a great time.     MW:  Very cool. To step away from the special for a minute, I’m just curious to hear your opinion, who are some of the upcoming artists today that you are really into that you really see going somewhere?     S.E.:  Oh Gosh, there are so many, and I don’t even know everyone’s names. Of course, I’ve been home and busy, so I’m on the internet going look at this person, look at the person. First let me say that it’s truly exciting to see so many young artists picking up instruments now, playing guitar, singing, in their rooms playing piano and drums, it’s just wonderful to see. I mean H.E.R. was on the show and Gabby’s amazing. I wanted to play with her because she’s from the Bay and she actually sent me a picture of her standing with my dad. Her dad took  her to see my dad’s band. She was like nine or 10 years old. It’s like here you are this massive star and we finally get to play together on this show. But she’s incredible. Miguel was incredible. These up and coming artists is just great.      MW:  Wow, what a story. That’s so cool. Stuff like that is awesome.      S.E.:  It is. You never know how someone’s going to turn out, how you influence people.      MW:  Last question before I let you go, for a huge Prince fan that’s going to be tuning in tomorrow night, what can you say to them about what to expect out of this tribute?     S.E.:  I’m going to tell you; everyone needs to put your dancing shoes on. You’re not going to be able to sit down. You’re going to have a great time. This is a time for families to come together and watch this. Music brings people together and this is a way to celebrate Prince’s legacy which is his music and we did it the best way we knew how, which was to showcase these artists and come together as a community. We hope the younger generation that don’t know a lot about Prince’s music will come and start researching and finding out how many different genres of music and the way he created and wrote songs and amazing guitar player. They will be as amazed as we were.      MW:  Thank you so much Sheila, it was great talking to you and all the best. Stay safe.     S.E.:  Thank you!

But monumental challenges remain.   Black, brown and poor communities suffer disproportionately from ongoing contamination. Deforestation, habitat loss and overfishing have wreaked havoc on global biodiversity. And the existential threat of climate change looms larger than anything that came before.   A fundamental, global change in thinking and action is needed that goes well beyond any one day, said former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who called Earth Day an opportunity for “a wake-up call.”   “But the darkness, the blindness is so pervasive,” said Brown, who several years ago started an organization with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to address climate change.   Outrage over the burning Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, an oil spill that killed thousands of seabirds off the California coast and a plunging bald eagle population blamed on pesticides drew millions of people to the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.   Later that year, Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency to oversee the nation’s response and in ensuing years, passed landmark laws to protect air and water quality, marine mammals and endangered species, and to clean up the nation’s most toxic sites.   “It was quite an amazing time,” said McCarthy, who led the EPA for four years under President Obama and now heads the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. “People just (said), ‘Hey, enough is enough … it’s just not going to happen anymore.’”   Environmentalist and author Bill McKibben, who has led a campaign for universities to pull investments from fossil fuel industries, said the first Earth Day “changed our understanding of the environment almost overnight.”   “We have way cleaner air and way more rivers, streams and lakes you can swim in than people did in 1970,” McKibben said.   Yet in the decades since, some problems that sparked the environmental movement have only gotten worse.   Urbanization, farming and industry have led to widespread loss of forests and grasslands, exacerbating the dangers of climate change and contributing to an alarmingly swift decline in animal and plant species. Overfishing threatens the ocean food web. Hotter global average temperatures are leading to both heavier rainfall and drought, and are contributing to sea level rise that threatens coastal communities.   And new issues emerged that weren’t foreseen in 1970, including widespread contamination of waterways and drinking water by perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl — industrial chemicals known collectively as PFAS — and plastic pollution that kills and injures marine life.   Meanwhile, minority and poor communities affected by ongoing pollution as well as climate change feel left behind as environmental organizations often focus on issues that don’t always resonate with struggling neighborhoods.   Studies show that polluting industry, highways and shipping terminals are more likely to be located in poor and non-white neighborhoods with less political clout, often because historic housing discrimination or poverty forced people of color to live there.   In Charlotte, North Carolina, blacks ended up living near a major railroad line and industrial areas. Those living near Houston refineries and chemical plants are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. Detroit’s most polluted ZIP code, near an oil refinery, is predominantly black and low-income.   “Saving the polar bears is important, don’t get me wrong, but we’re dying in our neighborhoods. What about saving people, too?” said Wasserman, who spent a decade fighting to close two coal-fired power plants in Chicago’s two largest Hispanic enclaves and now worries plans for a distribution warehouse on one site will bring more diesel pollution. “We need to be talking more holistically about saving the earth in general.”   Environmental groups for decades also have struggled to get lawmakers to act on climate change — and to persuade the public to take it seriously.   Early water and air pollution were problems people could see and smell, while climate change until recently had seemed decades away.   “The initial burst of things around Earth Day were mostly things that directly affected people — freeways cutting through their neighborhoods, oil spills on their beaches, their river in Cleveland catching on fire,” said Denis Hayes, who was the 25-year-old national coordinator for that first Earth Day and who is still involved in the movement.   Then, efforts to speak to worldwide climate change began in the 1990s. “That is much more difficult to get people aroused by,” Hayes said. “Maybe more important, it’s more difficult to address.”   As evidenced by last year’s climate protests, a new, diverse generation of activists is demanding action, fueled by fears the worst impacts will happen in their lifetime.   Yet environmental issues have become so politically polarized that it’s difficult for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground, said Carol Browner, who was EPA administrator under President Clinton and directed climate change policy under Obama.   “We could have done a better job at maintaining the bipartisan support for environmental protection,” she said.   Now, environmentalists fear, regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration, along with attacks on science long used to make decisions, also threaten years of progress. Trump is pulling the U.S. out of the landmark Paris agreement, which the United Nations rolled out on Earth Day 2016.   Some Democratic lawmakers have responded by introducing the sweeping Green New Deal to transition the economy away from fossil fuels, and many of the Democratic presidential candidates rolled out their own climate plans. But such efforts face stiff opposition from Republicans and some within the party.   For environmental reforms, the support of minority communities will be very important, activists say, because people of color will comprise the majority of the U.S. population within about 20 years.   Yet representation of people of color in large environmental organizations still is far too low, said Dorceta Taylor, a University of Michigan professor who researches the social impacts of environmentalism. Taylor, who is black, published a study in 2014 study that found just 16% of staff jobs in those organizations were held by minorities, though that’s a big jump compared to 10 years earlier.   Green 2.0, an advocacy organization that tracks racial and ethnic diversity among the top environmental groups and foundations, found growing diversity among staff and boards, though minorities still were just a fraction of the leadership compared to whites in most organizations.   Minorities care deeply about pollution and climate change “because they see it 24/7,” said Robert Bullard, an environmental policy professor at Texas Southern University and a longtime environmental justice activist.   “Earth Day 50 should not look anything demographically like the first one, which was very white and middle class,” he said. “It needs to be … a day to celebrate the fact that our country is changing.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan is now allowing the state’s barbershops and salons to stay open to service essential personnel only during the coronavirus pandemic.  Last week, some licensed beauty professionals called on the governor to let them stay open, with safety precautions in place.   The guidance on the order now says that while barbershops and salons are required to generally stay closed, they can provide services to essential personnel under certain conditions.   The barber/salon may only provide services to customers on an appointment basis, and walk-ins are not allowed. They also can only have one customer in the establishment at a time.   They also can only service employees who are required by their employer to have certain “grooming standards,” and the customer must have written documentation of the employer’s standards. This could include a letter from the employer or a copy of the employer’s policy establishing the standards.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Closings & Cancellations In Baltimore, Across Maryland   What Is A Coronavirus?   The Symptoms Of Coronavirus And What You Should Do If You Feel Sick   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland     The new guidance also requires the customer and barber/salon staff to wear face coverings unless it would be impossible for the services to be performed with a face covering on.   Then, after each customer, the staff must clean and disinfect the area where they performed services in accordance with CDC and the Maryland Department of Health guidelines.   READ MORE: What does “essential” mean in Maryland under Gov. Hogan’s stay-at-home executive order?    The barber/salon must also get phone contact information from each customer. If any staff test positive for COVID-19, they must tell all customers promptly who was serviced at their establishment in the 14-day period before the date the establishment staff gets test results.   So will this help barbers/salons across the state?   Barber Steven Rowell, the owner of Hairway to Steven in Towson, said it’s a baby step in the right direction, but not nearly enough.   “It’s better than nothing at all,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be able to cover my BG&E and telephone.”   Neha Gupta is the owner of NEHA threading salon and spa in Pikesville. She said with the restrictions there won’t be enough work to bring back her 17 employees.   “It is only a one-on-one basis and the business will be slow,” Gupta said. “(Employees) are actually making more money staying at home through unemployment.”   It’s a similar story at Sam’s Barbershop and Styling in Lutherville.   Current owner Mark McBain said if he brings back his 12 employees, even for a couple of hours a week, they’ll lose their unemployment benefits.   Instead, McBain decided to man the shop on his own, giving haircuts to essential employees free of charge.   “I just felt like I needed to do something,” McBain said.

Aside from breaking news that he will be this year’s  Madden NFL cover athlete , he also addressed two recent points of controversy that had been stirred up on social media.  The first topic of conversation centered on the recent picture on Instagram that showed Jackson working out with former Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown. According to team website reporter Ryan Mink, Jackson said that he would be happy if the team brought Brown in for the 2020 season.

Prior to 2019, Brown had tallied six straight seasons with 100+ catches and 1,200 or more receiving yards.   The second topic of interest was Jackson’s recent tweet in response to President Donald Trump. The President tweeted out in response to a video from last year’s draft that Jackson was a “great pick” over the weekend to which Jackson replied “Truzz Trump”. The exchange caused some to wonder whether the back and forth was a statement of Jackson’s political stance. He quickly dispelled that thought process Tuesday when asked about the exchange.     Jackson said he wasn’t making a political statement by responding to President Trump on Twitter. Said he was more agreeing with the sentiment expressed by Trump.   — Jeff Zrebiec (@jeffzrebiec)  April 21, 2020     https://twitter.com/jamisonhensley/status/1252631813341806593                                 ", "sentiment": 0.17616792929292932, "subjectivity": 0.320675505050505, "wordcount": 281}

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat not only to our health, but also to our economic well-being,” said Councilwoman Shannon Sneed. “We all have to be in this together and this means checking on Baltimore City residents and even providing extended pay and other resources to the workers of many of our great businesses in Baltimore City. Once this is over, Baltimore will be stronger and better than we have ever predicted.”   Council members John Bullock, Kristerfer Burnett, Mary Pat Clarke, Zeke Cohen, Ryan Dorsey, Bill Henry, Danielle McCray, Sharon Green Middleton, and Leon Pinkett III joined Sneed in writing to Peter Angelos, owner and chairman of the Orioles. The letter reads:     “We write as City Council members because our city and our country are in a moment of crisis. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not only put the health and safety of our entire city at risk, but also put thousands of Baltimore residents out of work. This includes the 700 concessions workers at Camden Yards.   Mr. Angelos, you have always been a friend to working people and organized labor. Through your law firm you represented working people to ensure that their medical issues were paid for. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike you refused to blame players and refused to field replacement players.   In 2015, when our city was in another moment of crisis, the Orioles did the right thing and paid these workers for games missed as a result of the widespread protests following the funeral for Freddie Gray. We call on the Orioles to once again be a leader in our city today and again pay workers while the MLB season is delayed.   We applaud the Orioles and the MLB for making the difficult decision to delay the start of the season. We also applaud the Orioles for publicly committing to make $1 million available for Camden Yards workers. We would like to make sure, however, that food and beverage concessions workers employed by Delaware North are included in this and paid for missed games.   We are all die-hard Orioles fans and love the team in good times and in bad. Now, we need the Orioles to support concessions workers at Camden Yards who are incredibly vulnerable to sudden loss of income. If Delaware North will not step up for their employees, Baltimore residents, than we hope that you will.

It is unfortunate that the Defense Production Act was not invoked months ago so that these ventilators could be rolling off the line now, since COVID-19 has been a public health emergency since the end of January. Maryland now has over 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of April 20. As numbers continue to rise across the state and region, reopening the White Marsh plant will put high-skilled workers back to work and ensure that ventilators will be available and easily accessible in an area with multiple hotspots.”   READ MORE: Baltimore GM Plant To Close On May 3   The lawmakers also sent a letter to GM Chairwoman Mary Barra asking her to reopen the plant, which closed nearly a year ago.

The study, which reviewed veterans’ medical charts, was posted Tuesday on  medrxiv.org , a pre-print server, meaning it was not peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia.   In the study of 368 patients, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate.   “An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs,” wrote the authors, who work at the Columbia VA Health Care System in South Carolina, the University of South Carolina and the University of Virginia.   Researchers also looked at whether taking hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, had an effect on whether a patient needed to go on a ventilator.   “In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,” the authors wrote.   There are currently no products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19, although research is underway on many drugs.   Hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades to treat patients with diseases such as malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Trump has touted the drug as a “game-changer” for COVID-19 and said hydroxychloroquine shows “tremendous promise.”   Physicians have warned that while Trump is enthusiastic about the drug, it still needs to be studied to see if it works and if it’s safe.   In  another recent study , researchers in France examined medical records for 181 COVID-19 patients who had pneumonia and required supplemental oxygen. About half had taken hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital, and the other half had not.   It found there was no statistically significant difference in the death rates of the two groups, or their chances of being admitted to the intensive care unit. However, it found eight patients who took the drug developed  abnormal heart rhythms  and had to stop taking it. This research also has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan went on a number of morning talk shows Tuesday to defend his decision to  buy 500,000 coronavirus test kits for Maryland  after  President Donald Trump called him out  for not knowing his state’s testing capability during a press conference Monday.  Trump singled out Hogan for purchasing the tests from South Korea for $9 million and not understanding the state’s testing capabilities.   “Some of the governors, like as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list, he didn’t understand too much about what was going on,” Trump said. “The governor of Maryland could have told Mike Pence because that’s a lot of money. No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea, I think he needed to get a little knowledge who would have been helpful.”   Trump also added he felt Hogan acquiring the tests was unnecessary.   “No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a better knowledge, that would have been helpful,” the president told reporters at his Monday night briefing.   President Trump appeared to confuse having access to those tests with the ability to process them. He repeatedly said Maryland had enough resources to process tests at federal labs in Maryland, which Hogan said the state was not allowed to use.   “We now have the tests. They have the labs, and that should be a great solution,“ the governor told MSNBC.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Hogan said he’s not sure why the president lashed out at him, saying that the governors had a great call Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and that he thanked Pence and the president’s coronavirus task force for their help. He said on that call they told the governors about federal labs in each state.     “We were very familiar with all of the labs in our state already but the list they provided us was all federal labs, which I pointed out, and which we hadn’t had any access to,” Hogan said on “The View.” “But our discussion really was about test it wasn’t about lab so the president seemed to be a little confused yesterday in his press conference I have no idea what set him off.”   Hogan said the president asked all the governors to get our own tests.   “He said we needed to be leading and we needed to be stepping up and the governors needed to go get their own testing. That’s what we’ve done,” he added. “The president was not on that call, and I was somewhat, you know, taken aback by his, his sort of fighting attacks on me yesterday I have no idea what that was about.”   CORONAVIRUS LATEST:   Gov. Larry Hogan, ‘The View’ Host Whoopi Goldberg Share A Laugh About Maryland Police Department’s Viral Post On Man Checking Mail Without Pants   On “Fox & Friends,” Hogan reiterated that he was just following the president’s previous directives about reaching out and finding your own ways to test.   “I’m really not sure what he was upset about,” Hogan said, adding that on Monday the governors got a commitment that states can use federal labs, they previously didn’t have access, to for coronavirus testing.   “We already knew where the state labs were in our state but the list that they gave us was mostly federal labs, which we’ve been attempting to use for more than a month now,” Hogan said on Fox News. “So, we got a commitment yesterday from the Vice President and from the President that we can now use federal labs, which is terrific.”   On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Hogan was asked “Would there be have been an easier way to get testing to your state is the president right about that? Are you missing some knowledge, and if there was an easier way what would it be?”     “Well if there was an easier way we certainly would have taken it, you know, every governor in America has been fighting to get tests since the beginning of this crisis and it’s probably been the number one problem in America throughout this entire crisis,” Hogan said. “You know, the President said that the governors are on their own and they should really focus on getting their own tests and that’s exactly what we did. His message changed yesterday, I’m not sure why, but we were very pleased that we had such tremendous success this half a million tests that we secured is more than the top four out of the five states in America have done.”   Hogan said the president has since approved state use of Maryland’s federal labs and sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday afternoon thanking him for doing so.   As for when Hogan said Maryland will reopen, he said he’s listening to the experts’ guidance on that, which is when any state or region has seen a decrease in new cases for at least 14 days.   He also called out the president for encouraging protesters to reopen states including Maryland. Over the weekend, protesters flocked to Annapolis to protest the governor’s stay-at-home order and other executive actions related to the coronavirus.

It doesn’t make any sense, the mixed messages we are getting out of the president,” Hogan said on “The View.” “He basically was encouraging people to violate his own federal policy so I don’t think it was helpful.”   Maryland saw a decrease in number for two consecutive days over the weekend, but then numbers increased Monday.   As of Tuesday morning, there are more than 14,000 cases of COVID-19 in the state and nearly 600 deaths.

Earlier Tuesday, ten Baltimore City Council members  called on the team to pay these workers  for missed games during the coronavirus pandemic.   “These are hard times for all of us. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat not only to our health, but also to our economic well-being,” Councilwoman Shannon Sneed said. “We all have to be in this together and this means checking on Baltimore City residents and even providing extended pay and other resources to the workers of many of our great businesses in Baltimore City. Once this is over, Baltimore will be stronger and better than we have ever predicted.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The MLB postponed its season after concerns over the coronavirus continued to grow in March.   Last month, all 30 baseball teams pledged $1 million each to support their workers. That plan, though, doesn’t include the hundreds of concessions workers who are not getting paid.   One of those workers, Kareem Boy, has been in love with Orioles fan for five-and-a-half seasons. Now, he and more than 700 of his coworkers are missing out on their paychecks.   “Whether the team is doing bad or great, we have to be there with a smile on our face,” he said, “and that’s what we do: we take pride in that and we thought they would take pride in us.”   Instead, Delaware North, the company that runs concessions at Camden Yards, had made Boy feel like he’s unappreciated, he said.   In a statement, Delaware North said:   “We understand the hardship this unprecedented situation has caused our dedicated part-time employees in Baltimore and around the country. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that the impact of the crisis on the hospitality industry will be deeper and longer-lasting than anticipated. It has left nearly all of Delaware North’s businesses temporarily closed and is causing significant financial losses. We have been forced to place more than two-thirds of our full-time employees on temporary leave, and thousands of part-time employees cannot be scheduled for work as a result of the shuttered operations.   “We greatly appreciate all of our employees and hope they remain healthy and safe as we look forward to resuming operations and welcoming them back at the appropriate time.”   Boy said he now hopes the Orioles will step up to the plate to help him and his co-workers.   “Times are really hard right now and we just need them to help us out,” he said.

As his blood pressure plummeted, she tried to insert an intravenous line into an artery in his wrist.  A blood clot clogged the tubing.   Frustrated, Hibbert tried again with a new needle. A blood clot clogged up that line as well.   It took three tries to insert the IV.   “You just watch it clot right in front of you,” said Hibbert, director of the medical intensive care unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s rare to have that happen once, and extremely rare to have that happen twice.”   Hibbert and other doctors are finding that some patients infected with the novel coronavirus have a propensity towards developing blood clots, which can be life-threatening if the clot travels to the heart or lungs.   “The number of clotting problems I’m seeing in the ICU, all related to Covid-19, is unprecedented,” Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, a hematologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, wrote in an email to CNN. “Blood clotting problems appear to be widespread in severe Covid.”   Laurence and his colleagues looked at autopsies on two patients and found blood clots in the lungs and just beneath the surface of the skin, according to  a study  published last week. They also found blood clots beneath the skin’s surface on three living patients.   In the Netherlands, a study found “remarkably high” rates of clotting among Covid patients in the ICU.   An international consortium of experts from more than 30 hospitals gathered to consider the issue. Their conclusion: It’s unclear exactly why, but coronavirus patients may be predisposed to having clots.   “This is one of the most talked about questions in Covid right now,” said Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of the division of critical care medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.   At Montefiore, they’ve started to put all Covid-19 patients on low doses of blood thinners to prevent clots, Gong said.   Not all hospitals have taken that step — but they’re still concerned.   “It’s out of the norm, and we’re wondering, are blot clots one of the reasons why these patients are dying,” said Dr. Todd Rice, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.   ‘Alarming’ rates of blood clots   Being in the intensive care unit, sick and lying still, can be a perfect storm for blood clots for any patient.   “Even before Covid, we’re on high alert for suspicion of clots in the ICU because they’re at high risk,” Gong said.   Even so, doctors have a hunch that Covid patients might be clotting even more than other ICU patients.   The Dutch study of 184 patients in the ICU with Covid-19-related pneumonia found that more than 20% were having clotting issues.  A study  of 81 similarly ill patients in Wuhan, China, found a 25% incidence of clots.   Dr. Behnood Bikdeli, who helped coordinate the international coalition of physicians looking into the clotting issue, called those numbers “alarming.”   Bikdeli, a cardiovascular medicine fellow at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said there are three major reasons why Covid-19 patients might have an especially high risk of clotting.   One is that vast majority of patients who become severely ill with coronavirus have underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. These patients — whether they have coronavirus or not – have a higher tendency to clot than healthy patients.   Second, one way coronavirus can kill patients is through a “cytokine storm,” where the body’s own immune response turns on itself. Patients experiencing that storm, because of coronavirus, influenza, or any other reason are at a higher risk for clotting.   The third reason is that there could be something about the novel coronavirus itself that’s causing clots.   Doctors say it’s hard to know exactly what’s behind what they’re seeing with Covid-19 patients in the ICU.   “My gut tells me there are probably a subset of Covid patients who have really abnormal clotting behavior, that this is happening more frequently than we would expect it to,” said Hibbert, an instructor at Harvard Medical School.   She quickly added, though, that doctors’ gut feelings are “notoriously misleading” and that studies need to be done to get to the bottom of exactly how common clotting is among coronavirus patients.   A tricky fix   Fixing these clotting issues can be tricky.   While a low dose of blood thinners to prevent clots is generally considered low risk, that might not be enough to prevent clots in some patients. Giving larger doses, however, could make a patient bleed excessively, which can be deadly.   That leaves doctors in a conundrum. Some patients might benefit from larger doses of blood thinners because they’re very sick with Covid-19, and their blood tests show they have elevated levels of  D-dimer , a substance that indicates they might have clotting issues.   Doctors at Harvard have proposed doing a large study on blood thinners for these patients, Hibbert said.   “There’s a crying need for these kinds of rapid trials,” Gong said.   Laurence, the hematologist at Weill Cornell, said since treating clotting can be so tricky, he wants to figure out what’s causing the clotting in the first place.   “We’re trying to shut off what’s causing it,” he said. “There’s overexuberant clotting going on with Covid patients, and we’re trying to keep ahead of it.”   While studies sort this out, doctors are being extra vigilant with their Covid-19 patients.   Hibbert described how a nurse recently had to constantly administer a blood thinner called heparin to a Covid-19 patient while the patient was undergoing kidney dialysis, because clots kept clogging up the tubing in the machine.   “We had the nurse at the bedside pushing heparin to keep the machine from clotting off. That’s very rare,” Hibbert said.   Hibbert said she awaits the day when a study will nail down how often Covid-19 patients are having clotting issues, and what to do about them.   “This is one of the many challenges in taking care of critically ill patients and trying to decide if what you’re seeing at the bedside is rare and happening by chance, or if it’s part of a larger pattern that could change your practice,” she said.

At least one aircraft was expected to begin flights this month, but the department agreed to hold off until the court rules on the plaintiffs’ motion.   The lawyers for police said the city’s high-flying surveillance plan will provide law enforcement with another tool to tackle the city’s longstanding violent crime, which even the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been unable to suppress.   “Violent crime continues in Baltimore. We would have expected it to go way down given the orders that we are all living under, and that has not happened,” said Dana Moore, acting city solicitor.   Addressing a remotely conducted hearing because of social distancing orders, she added: “The community at large is crying out for solutions … They want us to take new and different and constitutional solutions that will make the city safe.”   RELATED COVERAGE:     Baltimore Police Defends Planned Aerial Surveillance Program   ACLU Of Maryland Files Lawsuit Against Baltimore Police Over Private Plane Surveillance Program   Baltimore City Board Of Estimates Votes In Favor Of Contract To Launch Surveillance Plane Pilot Program     Under the six-month pilot program, up to three planes will collect images of the city at a rate of one per second to help investigate murders, nonfatal shootings, armed robberies and carjackings. Weather permitting, Moore said, the aircraft will fly up to 12 hours a day.   About 90 percent of the city is expected to be covered by the technology. Analysts will then use those images as well as data from city-operated street-level cameras, license plate readers and a gunshot detection system to identify crime suspects and their associates.   Maryland’s largest city has tallied more than 300 homicides in each of the past five years, even setting a per-capita record in 2019. As of Tuesday morning, 82 people have been killed in 2020, or one more compared with the same period last year.   The city has also recorded 163 non-fatal shootings this year, down 24 compared with the same time last year.   The judge is expected to rule by Friday.   The civil complaint was filed earlier this month in federal court in Baltimore. It argues the program infringes upon people’s reasonable expectation of privacy regarding movement, results in indiscriminate searches without a warrant and impedes the right to gather freely.   The American Civil Liberties Union is representing the plaintiffs, including the group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle.   “There are unquestionably many weighty considerations here,” ACLU attorney Ashley Gorski said during the hearing.   While Groski said the police department’s objective of reducing crime is commendable, the agency “cannot pursue an unconstitutional policy in the service” of its objective.   Ohio-based Persistent Surveillance Technologies will operate the airplanes and employ the analysts.   The nonprofit of Texas billionaires Laura and John Arnold will pay for the planes, their pilots, hangar space and analysts. They also funded the 2016 secret tryout of the same technology in Baltimore. Top city officials were unaware of the police-approved test until the media revealed it.

Any semblance of the daily routine that she had grown accustomed to has been erased by the global disruption of a deadly pandemic.  Life as an  NXT  Superstar is almost always chaotic, but the current circumstances are taking it to next level insanity.   “Everything’s just turned upside down, and I don’t like it,” Kai said. “I want things to go back to how they were.”   Don’t we all?   Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, WWE and its talent have become the flag bearers for the “whatever it takes” and “the show must go on” mentalities. Pushing through has meant abandoning packed arenas and instead broadcasting on closed sets with only essential personnel allowed in the building.   It has also meant adhering to safety measures put in place to limit the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Talent and crew are required to wear masks at all times except for when they are performing on camera. Superstars must also be examined and cleared to wrestle by the medical staff each night. Anyone exhibiting symptoms of an illness will be sent home.   Despite the precautions, an alleged employee  anonymously levied a public complaint  against WWE with the Orange County, Florida Board of County Commissioners this week. The employee, known as “John,” claims it is impossible for talent and crew to maintain social distancing even with the sanitary precautions. The employee further stated that he feared he would be fired if he expressed his concerns with “higher-ups” and requested the county shut down production despite the company being deemed an essential business last week. The essential designation enables WWE to continue taping shows while a statewide stay-at-home order is in effect.   The wrestling giant responded by saying there was no truth to the allegations.   “These accusations aren’t true. Employees know they can confidentially go to Human Resources, not the public,” a statement from the company read. “Notwithstanding the appropriate protocol, no one would be fired if they were uncomfortable with their surroundings. We’ve made accommodations for individuals upon request.”   As for Kai? She feels confident that the steps being taken by WWE provide adequate protection.   The massive changes and empty stands are forcing Kai to completely rethink the way she performs. She is still playing to the audience, but it’s one watching at home. It’s all very strange to focus on something so invisible when you’re used to having the instant feedback of crowd reaction.   Normally fans will cheer if they like something and boo if they don’t. In most cases, wrestlers are good with either response. It’s silence that they dread because it means they’re not connecting with the crowd. But for more than a month, silence is all there has been. Every match is a guessing game and all Kai and others can do is hope they’re on the right track. The soonest any of them can get feedback now is by checking Twitter after a match.   Kai is currently in the midst of an in-ring feud with former bestie, Tegan Nox. Some fans believe with the chemistry they display their battles could potentially grow into a long-running classic akin to the Johnny Gargano-Tommaso Ciampa saga.   The two will write the next chapter in their feud on Wednesday night’s live  NXT  broadcast when Kai teams up with Raquel Gonzalez to face Nox and Shotzi Blackheart.   I had an opportunity to catch up with Kai as she prepares for the match to get her thoughts on the rivalry, their real-life friendship, and safety measures put in place by WWE and wrestling during a global pandemic.   >>READ:  Latest from the world of Pro Wrestling   This whole situation is incredibly weird. Your schedule must be really off from what it typically is.   It’s insane. From going to just shooting on a closed set, just the fact that we’re not in front of an audience anymore really makes you appreciate them so much more than before. It’s so difficult to do that. Yeah, it’s so strange, not traveling to do the live shows that we did anymore, or for now. Everything’s just turned upside down, and I don’t like it. I want things to go back to how they were. I never thought I’d say this, but I miss fans.   What is the biggest adjustment that you’ve had to make in terms of just being in the ring and still performing when you don’t have any of the fans there?   Focusing on the at-home audience more so than ever before. Obviously for TV, that’s already such a key thing to realize, that there’s just so many more people watching at home. But now that’s all we have. So, it’s very strange to just focus on that. It’s been quite a challenge, but we’re doing the best. I just really would like things to go back to they were, and I hope it’s not too far off.   NXT  TakeOver: Tampa didn’t get a chance to happen because of the pandemic. Would you be open to the idea of having a fan-less TakeOver, or is that something you feel like should be reserved for when you can get that packed arena again?   Honestly, it all depends on how much longer things will be the way that they are now. I’m not against it, obviously giving the fans at home forms of entertainment is key right now. I would obviously love, love, love for us to be able to do TakeOvers with the packed arenas again, but who knows how long this is going to be going on. I would not be against that idea at all, doing a crowd-less TakeOver at some point. … [It is] very feasible during this time, very doable what they did with two days of WrestleMania. I think it’s definitely achievable.   Talk a little bit about the chemistry that you and Tegan have. There are certain people that get put in the ring together and just work so well.    We started in WWE at the same time. We literally landed upon moving here at the airport at the same time, and she had the same rental car. So, I sort of knew her before I did Shimmer, and she did a Shimmer show, and that’s the only time I ever met her. I never worked her before or anything. So we were kind of still strangers to one another per moving here, but we became fast friends. It was crazy. We did everything together.   I think that the chemistry stems from a lot of trust. You have to have that in the ring, and we definitely have that. So yeah, I think if you have a connection with someone outside the ring, it just really does carry over to in the ring where you have to put your life basically in the other person’s hands a lot. So yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.   Being such close friends, were you disappointed then when the storylines shifted and you turned on her?   It was a little sad. I think that our tag team could’ve gone a lot further than it did because it just felt like we were able to work together as a tag team for such a short time before WarGames happened and then that storyline began.   But in saying that, being able to be with one of your best friends in the ring as opponents is one of the greatest things, because you’re able to tell this amazing story and really, really trust the other person. So, we were so into all of the stories, and we wanted to be able to put out some of the best wrestling we could. So yeah, it’s a double-edged sword.   Let’s talk a little bit about some of the safety measures that have been put in place. I believe Drew McIntyre told  TMZ  that he basically has a locker room to himself and maybe the talent has to wear masks. Are you feeling comfortable when you’re taping the shows?   I feel so comfortable taping all the shows that there have been a lot of measures being taken during this time. So yeah, all of us have to wear masks, besides from when we’re actually taping the matches, that’s definitely a need. Before we do anything, we have to check in with medical to make sure that we’re able to perform.   If anyone’s unable to, they get sent home. They can’t be involved or at the set at all. They film with only essential personnel. So, anyone that doesn’t need to be there isn’t, and they make sure that there’s only a certain number of people in the area where we film or the makeup area at any one time, so yeah.

According to the office of the inspector general (OIG), they received an allegation of embezzlement at the the family fun center on Nov. 29, 2019. They learned an unsanctioned, adults-only party occurred and concession stand proceeds were allegedly never deposited into the safe.   The Shake & Bake Family Fun Center has been in the Upton community since 1982. It received a $1.6 million renovation in April 2019 and offers state-of-the-art roller skating and bowling and can be booked for private events from $120 to $170 per hour.   The city’s Department of Parks and Recreations Human Resources Department conducted its own internal investigation and learned employees assigned to the Shake & Bake Family Fun Center hosted unauthorized parties at the facility. They advertised the parties on their personal social media accounts and sold $20 tickets for the events. They advertised a cash bar and access to purchasing food from the concession stand.   OIG officials learned a former employee hosted a late-night, adults-only party at the center on Nov. 23, 2019. That employee wasn’t charged a rental fee and the party wasn’t officially listed on the center’s schedule. The OIG found seven other late-night events advertised on social media. Five of the seven events were not on the center’s official schedule and two of the listed events didn’t have any verification of payment.   The investigation revealed a facility director allowed several organization to host parties without collecting rental or other related fees.   Even though the parks and recs department did self-report this situation in late December, they delay in reported led to a loss of key video footage and other evidence which is why OIG couldn’t determine who was responsible for the missing funds.   Parks and Recs completed their internal investigation before reporting the alleged theft to OIG.   The facility director led the internal investigation and accused the shift manager of stealing the deposit. They then took that person’s keys and escorted the employee from the building. OIG learned the facility director confirmed the Nov. 23 party back in September but didn’t charged the former employee the $680 rental fee. The reservation included the use of a VIP Billiard Room from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. The facility director also admitted to allowing a local DJ to host a late-night Rock & Bowl party at the facility and another small business.   OIG estimated thousands of dollars in revenue was lost due to unsanctioned parties and lack of collecting fees and proceeds correctly. Ultimately Parks and Recs fired the facility director for abusing his authority and violating city policy.

(WJZ) —  Spring has sprung in Maryland and even during a coronavirus quarantine pollen continues to be a problem for allergy sufferers.   The officials at Assateague Island National Seashore posted a stunning photo on Facebook that captures what looks like yellow paint in the water and along the beach.   What’s surprising is all that yellow is actually pollen, pine pollen to be exact.   “What in the world happened here?!?!?! Did someone SERIOUSLY dump yellow latex paint in the Sinepuxent and it washed up on the bayside of Assateague Island?!?!? Of course not! All of the yellow you see in this picture is actually pine pollen!,” park officials posted.     Pine pollen is considered large and should be too heavy to travel through the air, officials said.   “However, to compensate to its large size, pine pollen has two air capsules that are attached to either side of the pollen grain itself; if you were to look at pine pollen under a microscope, it would look like a Mickey Mouse head with the ears being the capsules,” officials continued in the post. “The air capsules reduce the weight of the pollen grain and make it easier to travel though the air. When the pine pollen settles out of the air and onto the water, the same air capsules make the pollen grains buoyant, so they float on the water. As the wind blows toward shore, the grains are pushed into one another and creates what appears to be a latex paint like mass along the shoreline.”   That’s a lot of pollen!

One of the more important is: Where do you actually work?", "originalurl": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/04/22/how-to-combat-poor-at-home-work-posture/", "previousfetches": 1, "bodytext": "  (CNN) —   Working from home  presents many questions to sort out. One of the more important is: Where do you actually work?  On the couch? At your dining room table? At the counter? In bed?   The answer matters because it’s important to focus on good posture while working from home to prevent a tight neck, sore back and aching wrists. And where you’re doing the work may be the problem.   But what is ‘proper’ posture?   Proper posture while seated should include your feet flat on the ground, directly underneath the knees. The legs form right angles with your butt on the chair and your knees coming out directly straight from your hips. You want to avoid having your legs dangling from a chair that’s too tall or sitting in a cramped style.   Moving up the body, focus on the spine being in proper alignment. Often the spine rounds forward as you’re typing on your computer or working on something in front of you. Fix this by bringing the abs in toward the spine, lifting the chest and rolling back the shoulders. You want your shoulders to be stacked over your ribs, and your ribs to be stacked over your hips.   Next, bring back your head so that your chin is over your sternum or your breast bone — not jutting forward over your body.   Finally, rest your arms on a desk or surface that provides a 90-degree angle so that your elbows can be bent at your sides and your forearms stretched out in front of you onto your computer or surface.   Ideally, you’d have your computer monitor at eye height and your elbows hugged in at the sides of your waist. However, if you’re working on a laptop computer, that is near impossible without an external keyboard. So, focus on the elbows hugging in at your sides with your forearms extended out to the keyboard, and look down to the computer screen with your eyes while keeping your spine in alignment and your chin back.   Props can help   Depending on where you’re sitting, you may find it’s introducing new problems into the equation. But problems often have solutions.   Problem:  Chair is too high.   Solution:  Put books, boxes or an ottoman underneath your feet so that your legs make a 90-degree angle — your knees stack over your ankles and your knees come straight out from your hips.   Problem:  Slouching on the couch.   Solution:  Sit upright on the couch with pillows behind your back, or sit sideways on the couch with your back against the armrest and your legs straight out in front of you.   Problem:  Lying in bed.   Solution:  Prop yourself up with pillows behind you, pillows underneath your arms and pillows underneath your legs. You want to have your knees bent and your arms propped up so that the elbows are at the same height as the sides of your body.   Problem:  Standing and hunched over a counter   Solution:  Prop your computer up onto boxes or magazines so that you can look at your computer at eye level instead of tilting your head down.   Exercises to combat poor posture while working   These exercises can be performed throughout the workday to fix improper posture.   Problem:  Hunched shoulders, tension headaches, neck pain.   Solution:  Perform a “shoulder square.” With your head facing forward, move your shoulders forward, up, back and then down. Repeat this five times forward and then reverse five times.   Problem:  Rounded upper back, middle back pain and stiffness   Solution:  Roll back your shoulders and reach your fingertips toward each other behind your back. Bring back your elbows and try to press the palms of your hands together at the middle of your back. If this is impossible, just keep the fingertips reaching toward each other. Hold for five slow, deep breaths and then release. This stretches the shoulders and sides of the neck.   Problem:  Low back stiffness, tightness and achiness.   Solution:  Stretch the sides of the body by pressing down firmly with your glutes onto your chair. Stretch your arms up toward the ceiling and clasp your hands. Reach over toward the right to elongate the left side of your waist. Hold for a breath, then switch to the other side. Repeat side to side five times.   Exercises routine to improve posture   Research shows that people who engage in a regular workout routine to improve posture have less pain levels in the neck, shoulders, middle back, lower back and pelvis. Adding in 20 minutes a day just three days a week helps.   To get you started, add in these exercises to your regular exercise routine:   Bent-over rows:  Holding onto a set of 5-pound dumbbells, hinge forward at the hips and allow the arms to reach toward the ground. Draw your shoulders away from your ears, and hug your elbows into your sides as you pull the weights up toward your chest. Release and repeat 10 times. This works the muscles of the upper back to help keep your shoulders back for proper posture.   Forward fold and sway:  Hinge forward at your waist and allow your arms to dangle toward the floor. Sway to the right and left, pressing down equally with both feet throughout this stretch. Hold for five deep breaths, and then slowly roll up. This relieves tension and tightness from the low back, middle back and upper back, as well as stretches the sides of the waist.   Cat and cow:  On your hands and knees, place your hands directly underneath your shoulders and your hips directly over your knees. Then, arch your back as you look forward and bring your shoulders back to stretch the chest. Exhale as you round the back, pulling the naval in toward the spine and rounding the spine up toward the ceiling. Repeat this 10 times.   Squat with raised arms:  Step your feet as wide as your hips and bend your knees. Reach your glutes back and make sure your knees are bent over your ankles. Then reach the arms up toward the ceiling but relax your shoulders. Pull in your abs toward your spine. This increases mobility in the hip flexors, strength in the legs, strength in the arms and trains your body to sit back in a chair with the spine in a straight line.   Breaks from work   Even if you are in perfect posture while working, standing up to take a break, stretch and move your body is imperative. Getting up every 30 minutes is what’s recommended according to  current research .   You could take a walk around your house, march in place and pump your arms up or stretch. This will improve the circulation in your body and even reduce your risk of death due to sitting. Placing an alarm or notification on your phone or work calendar is a simple way to ensure that you’re following these recommendations.   Standing desks  are also a great way to combat the sedentary nature of working from home. You can create your own per the above suggestions or invest in a premade standing desk.   However you choose to work, focus on elongating your body rather than tensing or rounding yourself into a ball. Elongating the neck, spine, and torso, and supporting the lower body with a stable foundation (90 degrees at the hips and knees), will help you create your perfect work-from-home posture.

It’s been five days since Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order requiring Marylanders to wear face masks in grocery stores and on public transportation.   When you talk or cough tiny spit droplets escape your mouth.   These droplets can carry the virus, and a mask can contain them, or at the very least, reduce the distance they travel.   “Even if it’s not not very good at stopping the droplets, at least it will have some effect on slowing down the puff of air that would carry them,” Dr. Donald Milton, a Professor of Environmental Health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Even with face coverings it’s important to practice social distancing. It’s also important to make sure the room you’re in has good air circulation   “Then distance almost doesn’t even matter because what you’re putting into the air will just build up and begin to fill up the whole space,” Dr. Milton explained.   Dr. Milton added that  face masks, distance and ventilation will be essential for keeping people safe as we work to regain some form of normalcy.

But, for more than 100 years, there has been one group of young women on the front lines always finding a way to make a big impact. They’re our Girl Scouts.   “I love being a Girl Scout because I help the world become a better place,” Wren Morgan, Girl Scout of Troop 744, said.   As the coronavirus pandemic crumbles through cookie sales and field trips right in the middle of the busy season nationwide, Girl Scouts are still finding a way to provide sweet treats to those on the front lines of the pandemic.   “Girl Scouts are resilient,” Violet Apple, CEO of Girl Scouts of Central Maryland, said.   The girls are all about spreading positivity.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Troop 744 out of Elkridge, Maryland, is giving back to the community by showing appreciation for our first responders.   “When all this happened, all this crisis, we didn’t know where all those cookies were going to,” Morgan said. “So we decided we were going to give it to hospitals.”   Mercy Hospital was first on the list to receive dozens of Girl Scout cookies during the week of the shutdown.   “It makes me feel happy that they’re still helping people and they will be happy when they receive their cookies,” Morgan said.   In the next two weeks, Troop 744 plans to make another delivery to the Children’s National Hospital in D.C.   “This shows their character and their confidence that they can make a difference in any circumstance,” Apple said.   In the meantime, Girl Scout Troops will continue meeting virtually, and proving to the world that even the youngest minds can come together to lend a helping hand during these unprecedented times.   “I think our girls are just showing that this pandemic will not beat them,” Apple said.

More than 1,200 employees have been rendered idle because they are unable to perform their duties. Many more are working off-site but at significantly reduced levels of productivity,” a letter to the university community reads.   In a letter, university president Ronald J. Daniels expressed how they will help mitigate a projected loss of $100 million in fiscal year 2020 and $375 million in fiscal year 2021 if no actions are taken.   “The magnitude of the challenge we face is unlike any we have experienced in recent memory, but it is one that we can and will overcome. It will require difficult sacrifices from all members of our university community, including a one-year suspension of contributions to employees’ 403(b) retirement plans, a freeze on base salaries, restrictions on hiring, and a pause on most capital projects. Provost Sunil Kumar and I are reducing our salaries for the next fiscal year by 20 percent, and deans and university officers are cutting their pay by 10 percent. These and other actions are set forth in detail below,” Daniels stated.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The university did not reimburse students for tuition but did reimburse students for the remainder of the spring semester of housing, dining, and student service charges at a cost of $12 million.   “We also extended more than $5 million in unanticipated financial support to students and their families during this difficult period, including in the form of direct emergency grants for essential needs, continuity of wages for suspended on-campus employment, and relief from summer work requirements as a part of financial aid,” Daniels said. “We know we will see even greater demand for investment in student aid in the coming months, and it is essential that we continue to meet our promise to make a Hopkins education as accessible as possible.”   Here’s a list of some of the ways the university will recoup its losses:     In fiscal 2021, the university will enact a one-year suspension of employer contributions to 403(b) and 457(b) retirement accounts   In recognition of the sacrifices that will be required across the university, Provost Kumar and I will reduce our salaries by 20% in the next fiscal year, and our deans and university officers will reduce their salaries by 10%.   The university instituted a general prohibition and review of base salary increases effective April, and we will continue this hold for the next fiscal year (ending in June 2021).   Staff promotions will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will require the written approval of the dean or division director.   For staff positions —the university is restricting hiring through fiscal 2021.   For academic positions —the deans will review all approved or planned faculty searches with the provost (including those with donor support) to jointly determine which should continue and which should be paused.   The university has halted new capital projects over $100,000 through FY21, including information technology and equipment purchases, with exceptions granted for projects that address critical life safety or systems issues or meet an urgent strategic need.   Due in part to the response to COVID-19, recent reductions in non-personnel expenses are expected to continue into the next fiscal year.     Read the letter to the JHU community here.

(CBS Local)  — For Sarah Willie, a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a nursing home in Hillsboro, Missouri, coming home after a long day had become almost as stressful as work itself.  Willie lives with her fiancé and her ailing mother in nearby House Springs. Her mom suffers from underlying medical conditions that along with her age, make her highly susceptible to the novel coronavirus.   “She suffers from congestive heart failure and lung problems and she’s a severe diabetic so she has amputations and all those fun stuff,” she told CBS Local’s  Katie Johnston . “You know, I may be able to fight [COVID-19] off, but she won’t. She can’t,” Willie said.   To protect her mom, Willie considered leaving the house and staying somewhere else for the duration of the pandemic. Then she came across  RVs 4 MDs , a Facebook group that connects frontline health care workers and first responders with free mobile housing — typically recreational vehicles and campers — so they can stay close to home while still distancing from their families.   RVs 4 MDs was  launched  on March 24 by Emily Phillips, a mother of three from Celina, Texas. She had posted on Facebook asking if anybody had an RV that her family could rent so her husband, an ER doctor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, could  safely self-isolate  at their home.     \"Anything just to ease their minds a little bit.\" A Facebook group is connecting health care workers needing to self-isolate with people willing to offer their campers.  https://t.co/VFa3Rpzwx2   — KDKA (@KDKA)  April 10, 2020     “Within five minutes of my post, somebody offered their RV and I couldn’t believe it,” she recalled. “Her name was Holly Haggard, and she offered it for free and I thought that was amazing. So my husband and I drove over there, got it and on the way home, somebody else said that they needed an RV. And so I said to Holly, ‘let’s make this a thing.'”   With a network of volunteers spanning across the nation, Phillips says RVs for MDs has made approximately 900 matches and counting. The group, which has grown to an astonishing 30,000 members, has also expanded internationally to operate in places like Dubai and Australia.   “It’s unbelievable,” she says. “I’ve never seen so many selfless people get together to help a mission, especially with all the anxiety and depression and people that have been having it come together to join forces with us to help this, I’ve never seen anything blow up like this. It’s been divine.”   When Willie posted her request, she was prepared to wait a week or two to hear back. But within 48 hours, she was matched with a spacious, luxury RV donated by Marty and Donna Bondurant, a local couple.   “Complete strangers, total strangers and I feel it was a godsend in a way. I felt like I was sent two angels,” she says. “They have gone over the top for me, over the top.”   Willie moved in just before Easter.   “I get to sleep in a nice, big king-sized bed. I get food to eat. I get a washer and dryer to wash my clothes and dry my clothes. I mean it’s luxury in a sense because it’s better looking than my house, honestly, it’s so nice.”   The only downside for Willie is that the RV is so big, she’s not able to park it in front of her home and thereby see her fiancé and mother on a regular basis. Instead, she’s staying about 20-30 minutes away on the Bondurants’ property.   Willie says she feels a bit lonely, but says she’s staying strong by keeping busy and maintain a regular schedule an regiment.   “If it wasn’t for Marty and Donna for saving her life by offering me a place to go…” she tearfully says. “It has impacted my life. This group really has changed my life for the better.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.1147517730496454, "subjectivity": 0.4914470812875068, "wordcount": 654}

CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke with Buckley to discuss this week’s episode and the progression of Sonny through the years.   MW:  Hey there A.J., excited to talk to you about t his week’s   new episode  “ E dge Of  N owhere .”  As t hings have been going the last few weeks there’s been a lot of tension building up with your character  So nny .  He’s been  sent to Armory school and then everything that went down at the barbecue ,   s o what do you think is going on in  Sonny’s  min d  right now  as  things seem to keep piling on top of one another ?     AJB:  I think the whole team is going to change; a s teams do, as  families  do,  people grow .  W hat they thought their  life  was going to be  or where they were  going to be or the people that they’re with isn’t what they had in mind. I think  change is what  S onny’s never been good  with.  I think there’s a lot of fear because his family, his brothers  pretty much is the only family he’s had in his life; he can feel a  shift in everything .  I think that puts a lot of stress on  him.      MW:   W hat’s it been like for you playing  Sonny  over the years ,  a character who has  a bit of an edge to him ?       AJB:  I love it . It’s probably one of the  funnest  characters  I’ve gotten to play. I just kind of play this Texan   wise-ass,  th is  hard charg ing   kind of  character .    It’s  really something  I’ve  always wanted to play . One of  my  all-time  favorite  characters is John  McClane . This  is the closest I’ve got t o  play that type of  character, b eing  a  h ar d  charging , door kicker, it’s been really fun.    T he writers this year  have been  really great .   Spencer, our  showrunner give s  you some great material . With Sonny going back to Texas  and getting into work with  his  dad and  work out his  relationship with his father,  introducing the character   Rachel  Boston  a  high school love that he had .   For  me  it  was cool to see  Sonny  going back ,  it  got me to  understand  sort of  what is behind the curtain .   H e’s very closed off in certain things ,  b ut this  he sort of  has to  face ,  to look at who he is an d the  changes that he  internally  needs to make as a man .   B e  a  better man , to be a  better teammate .     MW:  I always think that’s so cool when actors play a character for a number of years and they get a chance to understand and grow .   H as that changed the way that you view  Sonny?   Ha s it changed the way you want to portray him from first da y to  where you are now ?     AJB:  I think yeah .  I think  in how the  story is going t o o  and how it pertains to  your  life .   You evolve as an actor   you evolve a  better understanding of who the guy  is.  I really love  Sonny. Every  part of  Sonny  that  fun  l o ving ,   hard  charg ing guy.   I’ve incorporated a lot of myself in there . From when I  first  read t he pilot script  to  who  he  is now,  i t’s a  really cool evolution; e specially this season .       MW:  Very cool.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan said he will announced Maryland’s Roadmap To Recovery plan on Friday. This plan will mark how Maryland will reopen after the coronavirus pandemic led to a stay at home order to slow the spread of the illness.  “On Friday, we will be introducing our Maryland strong roadmap to recovery,” Hogan said. “A safe, effective, and gradual plan which will allow us to reopen to rebuild and to recover just as soon as it is safe for us to do so.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “This recovery plan, which has been developed over many weeks in consultation with our coronavirus response team of doctors and public health experts, has four essential building blocks that are needed to be solidly in place before we can be in position to begin lifting restrictions,” he continued.   Hogan said in order to reopen the state, there would need to be a larger testing capacity and on Monday he announced Maryland bought 500,000 coronavirus testing kits from a South Korean lab.   The first step in the four-step plan to reopen the state is to expand the state’s COVID-19 testing capacity, which was increased by that purchase.   Second, is to increase the hospital surge capacity, Hogan announced Wednesday that  Laurel hospital was reopened with 135 beds.    CORONAVIRUS LATEST:     Gov. Hogan Reopens Laurel Hospital To Treat COVID-19 Patients   Do Not Wait’ | Prince George’s County Executive Says Men Are Waiting Too Late To Seek Treatment For COVID-19     Third is to increase the supply of PPE or personal protective equipment to protect frontline health care workers and first responders. And fourth is to have a robust contract tracing operation.   “Our teams have been making significant progress, and each of these criteria,” Hogan said. “Maryland has successfully expanded our testing capability by over 5,000%. Over the past month, we’ve completed more than 76,000 tests to date.”   Use cutting edge robotics, University of Maryland Medical System built their capacity in order to handle the ability to handle 20,000 tests per day with a $2.5 million investment from the state.   As for being prepared for a hospital surge, in addition to reopening Laurel Hospital the 250-bed field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center is completely staffed and set up. The state will begin admitting patients who no longer require hospitalization, but need a place to complete their care and fully recover.   The state also opened the first beds at Adventist Fort Washington Medical Center in Prince George’s County and are adding additional beds, including ICU beds, there and at UM Prince George’s Hospital Center in Cheverly.   They are also expanding capacity with 22 response tents across the state, including at Doctors Community Hospital, in Lanham, Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Clinton, Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring and Washington Adventist Hospital in White Oak.   There also adding 100 additional beds at Jessup and at Hagerstown to address the needs of corrections and detention centers.   “We’re now on track to not only reach, but actually exceed our goal of 6,000 additional beds by reaching a surge capacity of more than 6,700 new beds in the coming weeks,” Hogan said.   As for the PPE, Hogan said a multi-agency task force is working “literally around the clock” focused on the issue.   Hogan said the group has acquired 5.9 million surgical masks, including 1 million masks from Korea, 2.3 million surgical gowns, one million N95 masks, 1.1 million face shields and additional 1,000 ICU beds.   Finally, the governor addressed the state’s plan for contact tracing.   The state already has 250 contact traced working with local and state health departments across the state. On Wednesday morning, Maryland contracted National Opinion Research Center or NORC, operated by the University of Chicago with offices in Bethesda to be able to trace 1,000 cases per day. A new website, COVID link, will help in monitoring and collecting information about positive COVID-19 patients and who they may have come into contact with. It will use data from the CRISP system which is used to help patients make appointments for testing.   Hogan said the plan will “lead us safely out of this pandemic into a brighter and more hopeful future.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

Within days, the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets the seafood industry supplies.   Some seafood operations let employees go, while others have hired fewer people than they would in a more typical season.   John Martin, owner of the Martin Fish Co. in Ocean City, Maryland, told Capital News Service that a large percentage of the firm’s business is in the retail sector, including market and restaurant sales. Due to the virus, Martin Fish has been able to open its retail store.   “We are now in the process of figuring out how to open with the safety of our workers and our customers in mind,” Martin said. “Currently, we have had to lay off a significant number of employees that are directly relating to those end-user groups.”   He added that this has been a lesson for his company: within weeks a global issue can affect the world food markets and he needs to be more prepared for that in the future.   Jack Brooks, president of J.M. Clayton Seafood Co. in Cambridge, Maryland, explained that the seafood industry is a seasonal business and the coronavirus has hit the hardest during the industry’s prime time.   “We were planning on hiring between 65 to 70 workers for the season, but now that the markets have gone down we hired about 25 people,” Brooks said in an interview with CNS. “We sell our seafood to restaurants and with the restaurants being closed that has really hurt our business. We are taking this pandemic really seriously and are hoping that by next year we will be able to recover from the hard hits we have taken.”   The $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month includes $300 million for the nation’s fisheries industry.   The Maryland congressional delegation sent a letter on April 13 to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chris Owen, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, requesting that the aid include companies that process fish products for restaurants and grocery stores.   Fishing and processing seafood is a more than $600 million industry in Maryland.   “A new economic analysis found that Maryland’s oyster aquaculture operations contribute an average of $9 million per year to the state economy and have grown by nearly 25 percent annually since 2012,” the lawmakers wrote. “However, that growth, as well as the mostly small and family-owned businesses that comprise Maryland’s seafood industry, is threatened due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.”   Whenever the seafood industry can go back to relatively normal operations, company officials say the long-term labor problems will remain, despite the visa relief given just before the pandemic struck.   Foreign seasonal workers come to work for the seafood industry each year with the help of the H-2B visas. Such workers are high in demand as these companies would not survive without them.   A study conducted by Maryland’s Best Seafood found that without the additional H-2B visas released each year, seafood processors would lose close to $49 million in sales. Maryland would lose 914 to 1,367 jobs and the overall hit to the state’s economy could reach $150 million.   A letter to the Department of Homeland Security signed by seven senators, including Maryland Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, called the visas a “critical matter.”   “Local seafood businesses earn their livelihoods based on perishable products and need H-2B workers to harvest and process their respective seafood products so they can sell those products,” the senators wrote. “If these local businesses lose a customer base one year, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to come back into the industry.”   “The DHS grants a maximum of 66,000 visas to foreign nationals each year through the H-2B visa program, which is operated like a lottery,” the lawmakers said. “The workers are spread half-and-half to assist non-agricultural companies across the country between the first and second periods of the year.”   If companies don’t win workers through the lottery, they could be forced to stop business operations unless the DHS grants more visas for seasonal workers to shuck oysters, process crabs and harvest salmon.   Maryland Delegate Chris Adams, R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot & Wicomico, said last month he still had concerns over the recurring shortages of seasonal workers in the industry, which he called “gut-wrenching.”   Van Hollen responded to Adams’s concerns, saying he realized “it’s hard when it seems like we’re doing this on a short-term basis rather than having a long-term solution.”   Van Hollen, Cardin and Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, said they are working together to find this permanent fix.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Wooden and his staff have been using the school’s Facebook page for scavenger hunts, live dance parties, spirit weeks, and daily bedtime stories — all to stay connected.   “We have about 600 youngsters at HDGES and to not be with them everyday it hurts,” Wooden said.

As coronavirus cases climbed past 14,000 Wednesday, it’s preparation — not panic — inside hospitals statewide.   “We’ve had about four weeks to prepare,” Dr. Stuart Bell, Chief Medical Officer of MedStar Good Samaritan and MedStar Union, said.   At a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Larry Hogan said Maryland is making progress, increasing the number of hospital beds including statewide.   To combat a spike in cases, Gov. Hogan said they’ve built nearly 22 surge response tents outside hospitals.   They’ve also reopened Laurel Hospital in Prince George’s County and turned the convention center in Baltimore City into a makeshift care center that’s now open with 250 beds and a medical staff on standby to treat patients who no longer require hospitalization   University of Maryland Medical System officials said as the numbers grow, hospitals need to get ready.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “As we expand our testing capacity outside the walls of the hospital, that will also allow health systems to better prepare the needed resources for what we have coming as we get on the backside of this peak,” Mohan Suntha, CEO of UMMS, said.   Hospitals statewide are feeling the pressure, but Dr. Bell said the slower climb in cases recently has given them enough time to prepare   “It enabled us to start developing our plans,” Bell said.   He said doctors and healthcare workers go through emergency preparedness training and they can quickly deploy resources from one hospital to another if necessary.   So, in extreme situations like this, they’re ready.   “We’ve been able to manage almost all of it so far,” Bell said.

The award-winning author is back with a new book from Simon & Schuster called “ The Hidden Girl and Other Stories ,” which is a collection of sixteen of his best short stories from the last five years about science fiction, fantasy, and what it means to be human.   “I have published 150 short stories by this point and I have one previous collection called The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories. This is the second one and it combines some of my newer stories and the overall themes of how do we remain human in the face of cataclysmic change,” said Liu in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “When I wrote these stories, I wasn’t thinking of pandemics. What I try to focus on is the way technology is changing and defining what it means to be human and how do we react to that.”   FULL INTERVIEW:   One of the topics that Liu honed in on is how technology has changed what it means to know something.   “We think that we know something, but all we know how to do is look it up,” said Liu. “I was a practicing lawyer for many years and you can’t actually draft anything from scratch anymore. You take a form and you modify it. I wanted to explore this idea of the externalization of our knowledge and our sense of identity. The way we put so much of it out into the digital world. A lot of the stories explore this concept of singularity, which is the idea that we become digital beings. What does that mean and how do you remain human in a world like that.”   Liu’s book is available now wherever books are sold.

Maryland State Police said they received a call shortly before 7 p.m. from a citizen who reported a man in the shipping center parking lot at 75 North East Plaza who appeared to be looking into vehicles.   The responding trooper began looking for the man and was told that an attempted robbery had occurred minutes before at the Walmart in the area.   A store employee reported a man came to her register, displayed a knife and said he was robbing the store.   The employee ran to another area of the store and the man left. The suspect description matched the description of the suspicious man seen in the parking lot.   Another trooper checked a nearby shopping area and located the man in the 2500 block of Pulaski Highway.   Troopers were later approached by a woman who said she saw a man armed with a knife who had attempted to carjack her at the gas station earlier in the evening.   She provided a similar description of the man troopers had in custody.   Troopers determined evidence indicated Johnson was involved in the attempted carjacking at the gas station and attempted armed robbery at the store.   After a review of the investigation with the state’s attorney’s office, charges were filed. No one was injured in either incident.

An explosion of COVID-19 cases is forcing some meat packing plants to shut down, further straining the U.S. meat supply chain and raising fears of potential shortages.   “Meat shortages will be occurring two weeks from now in the retail outlets,” Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services, tells  Bloomberg . “There is simply no spot pork available. The big box stores will get their needs met, many others will not.”   Tyson Foods on Tuesday said it is closing the company’s largest pork plant, which has 2,800 employees and processes 19,500 hogs a day in Waterloo, Iowa. The shutdown followed an outbreak of at least 180 COVID-19 cases there.   “Despite our continued efforts to keep our people safe while fulfilling our critical role of feeding American families, the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns has resulted in our decision to stop production,”  said  Steve Stouffer, group president of Tyson Fresh Meats.   The closure follows other major shutdowns at plants run by Smithfield Foods, JBS USA, and other companies that prop up the country’s meat supply.   Processing plants can be a breeding ground for the virus because many workers spend their day side-by-side.   “We are very close. We can’t use a social distance at that place,” said a man who recovered from COVID-19 who works at Smithfield Foods in South Dakota, where almost 900 employees have tested positive.   The disruptions are cascading through meat supply chains and causing “weird” dislocations for prices, Bloomberg reports. Finished products are surging, while farmers are getting paid much less for animals.

(WJZ) —  Thursday marks the 25th draft in Ravens history.   The previous 24 have produced some legendary players for Baltimore, and General Manager Eric DeCosta is poised to pick another top crop.   It’s DecCosta’s second year heading the draft after Ozzie Newsome led the way the previous two decades.     GM Eric DeCosta checking in with a tour of his Draft room setup:  pic.twitter.com/Sqb6GfLY5A   — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens)  April 22, 2020     The Ravens are known for wheeling and dealing in the draft; like trading up to get their star quarterback Lamar Jackson two years ago.   “We love to make trades,” DeCosta said. “We’ve made a lot the last three years. We made a ton of trades, and it’s been really fun for us. I think we’ve benefitted from some of the trades we made. This year we do have a lot of trades. We have the opportunity to go up and get a guy.”   The Ravens sometimes trade up and sometimes take advantage of players who fall; like offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr., who’s poor performance in the NFL Combine dropped him to the third round where the Ravens grabbed him. He’s been a two-year starter and a Pro Bowler.   “I think the biggest thing for these scouts and talent evaluators and GM’s is it’s not just about the combine, it’s film, it’s the guy that you’re drafting,” Brown said.   Like Brown, Marshal Yanda was a third round draft pick and retired this year after 13 seasons in a Hall of Fame caliber career. His spot will likely be addressed in this draft.   The Ravens have the 28th overall pick in the first round. They’ve never picked at No. 28.   Running back Mark Ingram, however, came into the league as a 28th overall pick just like his dad. So, the Ravens, with the 28th pick…   “They have to be getting a legend right? At 28, they have to be picking a legend, nah. No, hopefully get a high impact player, player that can come in right away and be impact player for us and help us win championships,” Ingram said.

The actor plays Russian intelligence officer  Yevgeny Gromov  and Ronin’s character is a major part of the eight and final season of the series and he’s loved every minute of being on the show.   “It’s really stepping into an alternative reality where everything is real and you get to touch everything and work with the material. It makes it really, really special,” said Ronin in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “It’s really quite cool. I’ve been a fan of this show since it came out. I never thought I would be a part of it and when an opportunity came up it was quite surreal. I literally had the chance to walk into one of my favorite shows. It was a really special moment. This show did get to travel around the world quite a bit. I’ve only been a part of it the last two years and even still, we’ve shot in Virginia, Hungary, Morocco, and Los Angeles. All we can do as actors is create wholesome people.”   FULL INTERVIEW:   Ronin says that everything you saw with Gromov’s evolution this year, also existed last year. The multiple layers of Ronin’s character and the show is one the reasons why he thinks “Homeland” has been so successful over the years.   “When you work on a character, you have to think of it as an onion,” said Ronin. “What I had to do this year is figure out how my onion can create another onion. Yevgeny had to figure out how to work with Carrie. There’s an element of respect and understanding and there’s a fascination because they really are mirror images of one another. They complete one another and understand one another. At the same time, they still work for their own people and their own flags.”   While Ronin has worked with many great actors in projects like “The Americans” and Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,” Claire Danes is in a category of her own based on how she’s able to jump in and out of playing Carrie Mathison.   “It’s quite remarkable. I’ve been watching the show since the beginning and what’s really cool is that she is able to get into that character instantly,” said Ronin. “We could be having a conversation about Christmas and kids and then literally when they call action, it’s on. In the eyes you can see that energy change. She is an absolutely remarkable artist. It was a gift to work with somebody like her and somebody like Mandy [Patankin.]   Watch all of DJ Sixsmith’s interviews from “The Sit-Down” series  here .

Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning will compete at a yet-to-be-determined time, on a yet-to-be-determined course under a yet-to-be-determined set of rules. We do know that the sport will be golf and all donations and fundraising will  benefit COVID-19 relief .  The event has been  rumored  since last month, and was announced Wednesday afternoon. The date will likely be some time in mid-to-late May, the course will probably be in Florida and the  matchup  seems destined to be Woods-Manning vs. Mickelson-Brady. Confirmation is forthcoming, and all plans depend on official approval from the proper authorities.   Woods and Mickelson  matched up over Thanksgiving a year and a half ago at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. Mickelson prevailed after a four-hole playoff to take home $9 million. This year’s event, which could be the first major sporting event since coronavirus put all sports on indefinite hold, will serve a more worthy cause.   Tiger and Phil, two of golf’s best ever, have been competing against each other on the PGA Tour for decades. They have 20 major championships and 126 Tour wins between them. Their teammates in this charity event — Brady and Manning — have their own storied history of gridiron accomplishments, with eight Super Bowl titles between them.   If the possible May dates hold, the event is likely to be the first major sporting event during the pandemic. A significant sports-starved viewing audience will likely tune in, though in-person viewing may very well be limited to participants and those necessary to stage and broadcast the event.   The implementation of the needed social distancing measures could create a template, or best practices, for other sporting events to follow. At the very least, such attempts will help the PGA Tour when (if) it resumes in June with the Charles Schwab Challenge.   The Match: Champions For Charity , if the parties involved manage to pull it off, will provide some hope that a post-quarantine world is within reach. And late May is only a month away. The circumstances that would allow this event to happen, however, seem much further off. But at least it’s something.

To keep all of its full-time staff employed, the winery has gotten creative by training tasting room and sales staff on how to work the vineyard.   “Our staff is ready, they’re excited it’s a change for them. They know it’s not permanent so everyone’s really excited to get out there and start working,” Deford said.   So while their sales may be down, at Boordy Vineyards, they prefer to focus on the positives.   “To be able to have enough work to keep people employed, the fact that people are still looking for Boordy Wines, sales are not what they were but they’re still strong, all of that is just wonderful,” he said.

David DeBoy’s “‘Baltimore Hon’ In Quarantine” music video has garnered more than 100,000 views on Facebook and YouTube combined.   DeBoy, the brains behind “Crabs For Christmas,” said he got bored in quarantine a few days ago and decided to get creative.   Among the lyrics:   “The governor’s on the TV and he’s closing all the bars   “And we’re gonna have to leave because of that Coronavirus!   “And we gotta leave now because we’re all being corn-teen!   “So I went home, home, home, home to my Baltimore hon, Baltimore hon.”   DeBoy’s ‘Baltimore Hon’ is his wife Joellen. Luckily, she had the ‘hon’ wear on hand so she could be part of the fun.   As for the musicians and other players in the video, even though they’re also in quarantine — or is it corn-teen? — they still decided to get in on the fon after DeBoy reached out to them.   “I have a little experience writing funny songs about Baltimore, so I thought I’d try my hand on it,” DeBoy sais. “Luckily, I had an instrumental version of a song that I had written and put out on an album in 2011 called ‘I’m In Love, Love, Love With a Baltimore Hon’ and I changed the line to home, home, home, then tried to figure out how to make a video of it.”   DeBoy asked his friends to send him videos of them doing the things he sings about and they didn’t disappoint.   If DeBoy looks familiar, he has a large following thanks to his position as the master of ceremonies, judge and emcee each year at “Hon Fest” in Hampden.

Larry Hogan’s stay at home order, Penn North was bustling Thursday. People were coming and going and dozens of commuters streamed off buses. For many, it’s not a matter of choice but of necessity.   Dr. Rashawn Ray, a sociologist at the University of Maryland College Park, said not everyone is able to work from home.   “Social distancing becomes a privilege, the whole thought of being six feet away, if you’re living in a Baltimore housing complex and all of a sudden you have to go to work, you’re going to pass 10 to 20 people presumably before you even leave your complex, so what that means is your exposure if high,” Ray said.

Those numbers in Maryland and elsewhere galvanized celebrities, who performed on a BET special Wednesday to drive home the severity of the virus.   Groups like the  Baltimore Arabbers  and NAACP have also gone through hard-hit communities offering information about how to prevent the spread of the virus.   Sandi Thomas lost both her mother and sister to COVID-19. Both died days apart at a Baltimore hospital.   “My mother and my sister are gone,” she said. “They were doing everything they were told to do and yet it still got them.”   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still gathering statistics on why COVID-19 is hitting communities of color especially hard.   Ray, meanwhile, said the increased number of testing sites and medical resources in African American communities shows leaders are trying to make adjustments to meet the needs of those who are more at risk.

Washington received calls from other teams interested in trading up but opted to take a Heisman Trophy finalist considered by many the top non-quarterback available in the NFL draft. The front office’s hope is Young can have the same effect as reigning defensive rookie of the year Nick Bosa made on the San Francisco 49ers as the No. 2 pick last year.   Young appears to have that potential. He led the nation with 16 1/2 sacks and had 46 tackles during his junior season. Vice president of player personnel Kyle Smith said “everything” stands out about Young.   New coach Ron Rivera believes a top-five pick needs to provide an immediate impact, and the Redskins went with the best player available rather than addressing a major need. They already have Ryan Kerrigan and 2019 first-rounder Montez Sweat as part of their pass rush and spent 2017 and 2018 first-round picks on defensive linemen Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne.   Young watched from his home in suburban Washington with a picture of his late grandfather, Carl H. Robinson, stationed on the coffee table. After taking a call from the Redskins and putting on his newest hat, Young tweeted: “Proud to be a part of such a historic franchise. @Redskins, let’s GOOO.”     Proud to be a part of such a historic franchise.  @Redskins , let's GOOO 🙌  #HTTR  Check out my new  #PaniniInstant  card here  https://t.co/r7IE9PEKB8   #NFLDraft   #WhoDoYouCollect   pic.twitter.com/1LfA6o5ZJi   — CY2 (@youngchase907)  April 24, 2020     The Redskins traded their second-round pick this year to move up to get Sweat, leaving them without a selection until the third round at No. 66. A trade of longtime holdout left tackle Trent Williams could change that, and Washington has holes to fill at that position, cornerback, tight end and wide receiver.   Washington went 3-13 in 2019, but Young should provide a major boost to a defense that ranked 29th in the league last season. He could quickly become a fan favorite for an organization that hasn’t won a playoff game since 2005 because Young is a D.C.-area native.

He grew up in Upper Marlboro, 10 miles from his new home stadium.   Young also has a college connection to the two biggest pieces of the Redskins offense. He played with quarterback Dwayne Haskins and receiver Terry McLaurin at Ohio State in 2017 and 2018.   After the Cincinnati Bengals drafted Heisman winner Joe Burrow out of LSU first overall, the Redskins could have made it three Alabama players in first round over the past four years by taking Tua Tagovailoa. But owner Dan Snyder had a hand in selecting Haskins 15th last year, and Rivera will give the second-year pro a chance to keep the starting QB job in a competition against Kyle Allen.

For Journey, that means getting active.   “Journey usually starts out occupational therapy with yoga,” Ahsha said. “She can actually see her therapist and see the activities at the same time.”   In some cases, doctors are finding that treatments are even more effective through telehealth.   “It’s more effective in certain situations if you can actually provide the care in the home as opposed to providing the care in the clinic and then having to transfer it,” Crockett said.

It might be time to reconsider, experts say, especially if that extra effort is adding to your daily stress. Even the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is re-emphasizing there’s no real risk of getting the virus that causes COVID-19 that way.   “We want to assure you there is currently NO evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the #COVID19,” the agency tweeted recently.   Jamie Lloyd-Smith is one of the scientists who worked on the  only study to analyze  how long SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might remain on various surfaces.   Despite the fact his research found the virus might live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and metal and plastic for two to three days, Lloyd-Smith doesn’t bother to wipe down his own groceries or takeout.   “I don’t, personally,” Lloyd-Wright said. “I treat my hands as potentially contaminated while I’m handling the groceries and unpacking them and I make sure that I wash them fully when I’m done with that process.”   Virologist Dr. John Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades, is also not overly concerned.   “Personally, we’re alternating cooking food at home and getting takeout food for a houseful of kids home from college right now,” Williams said. “And we’re not wiping down the containers from the restaurant.”   Because the odds of someone coming along and depositing enough virus on a grocery item or takeout container are pretty low, “I view it as sort of a hypothetical risk,” Lloyd-Smith said.   “So yes, I’m careful, I’ll wash my hands, but I don’t sort of regard it as glowing radioactively with virus.”   His advice might change, said Lloyd-Smith, if the person was at high risk from the virus, such as elderly or immunocompromised.   “One reasonable and easy-to-implement precaution for groceries that don’t need refrigeration is simply to let them sit for a day or more before unpacking them,” he said. “This will vastly reduce the level of any contamination that is present.”   How did we get so concerned about groceries?   The concern over virus transmission via surfaces began in late March after the study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.   “What the study showed is that under certain conditions in the laboratory, which are obviously kind of artificial, SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,” Lloyd-Smith said.   The experiment did not account for other factors that could help to inactivate the virus, such as sunlight or disinfectants or look at varying levels of virus, Lloyd-Smith said, so there’s no “magic” in the numbers they found.   Food safety expert Benjamin Chapman agreed. “There’s no magic number in this because temperature matters, humidity matters, how much virus was put there in the first place matters,” said Chapman, a professor in the department of agricultural and human sciences at North Carolina State University.   The amount of SARS-CoV-2 also diminished rather quickly over time, compared to say, a norovirus or “cruise-ship” intestinal virus, said Williams, who is chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.   In the study the virus was down “a hundred fold on cardboard in eight hours,” Williams said. “That means 99.9% of the virus was gone by eight hours, and the same is true on stainless steel and plastic.”   “The cruise ship norovirus, however, can persist for many days in an environment on inanimate objects,” Williams added. “So you could be on a cruise and have norovirus and then your cruise finishes and I get on the next cruise in your cabin and I can get your norovirus.”   Washing hands is key   If you want to focus on something that makes a key difference every time, experts say, it’s much more important to become a fanatic about properly washing or sanitizing your hands after any potential encounter with coronavirus.   Instead of worrying about how long the virus will persist and spraying everything down or wiping it down with sanitizer, you can manage this “very unlikely route with low risk and make it even lower by just practicing proper good hand washing,” said Chapman, “or using hand sanitizer once you’ve returned home from the grocery store or gotten takeout food.   “I don’t want to discount this conversation or people’s fears, but it’s almost like it doesn’t matter much as long as everyone is washing their hands,” Chapman added.   If you are still really nervous about your risk of contamination by food products, then by all means use disinfectant wipes on the outside of containers, Williams said.   “Some people want to wear a belt and suspenders to hold their pants up, right?” Williams said.   “So if people are concerned about virus transmission from groceries or take out food, just carefully remove the inside containers of food from the outer bag, throw away the outer bag and then use a little hand gel or soap and water.   “But still, the odds of getting the virus that way are very, very low,” Williams added.

Jeffers said he’s working at Bellevue Hospital, one of the busiest hospitals in the city, and nurses are doubling up on patients.   “It’s not easy because you have patients really sick,” Jeffers said. “You have to be on your a game with these patients. One slip up, you have a big issue.”   He said every day poses a new mental challenge and fear of not knowing what to expect.   “You can’t prepare for this,” Jeffers said. “We don’t know each other, but we’re brother and sisters in this fight against COVID-19 together.”   Jeffers said he is getting compensated for his time, but all of the money is going to pay for school.

(WJZ) —  More than 45,000 unemployment claims were filed in Maryland last week, according to state officials.  That number is down from the previous week when more than 61,000 claims were filed.   The governor’s spokesman Mike Ricci tweeted the new numbers Thursday morning.   With such an increase amid the coronavirus pandemic, the labor department has admittedly fallen behind but officials hope a new program will help them catch up.   On Thursday, desperate Marylanders showed up at the department’s offices in person hoping for help. They were greeted by a locked door.   “My first thing was to file unemployment and I haven’t heard anything since then,” said Terry Turnbaulgh, who formerly worked for Baltimore Sound Stage.   He’s one of the countless Marylanders who haven’t been able to get through to the unemployment offices.   “The first week I didn’t expect to hear anything,” he said. “The second week I tried calling them and it went straight to a busy signal.”   Secretary of Labor Tiffany Robinson said they’re “overwhelmed” by the number of new claims coming in every day.   That led them to create  a new portal for Marylanders to apply for all unemployment benefits in one place . Beginning Friday at 7 a.m., everyone will be able to file online at  mdunemployment.com , including those who are self-employed, independent contractors, sole proprietors and those with insufficient work history.   “Those people previously had to call in and we know that there’s frustration in trying to reach us,” Robinson said.   In the coming days, the department is also launching a virtual agent and an online app that filers can use to get status updates about their applications.   On Twitter Thursday night, Ricci said the updates will be a “significant step forward.”     8. We hope this will help address a lot of the concerns people have had with the filing process. There will undoubtedly still be some issues, but this is a significant step forward.

He told WJZ he’s been trying to reach someone for weeks to no avail.   “I don’t know if my unemployment is going to come in or not,” he said. “Where am I going to get my answers from?”   Robinson said the volume of calls is also taking a toll on those answering the phones.   “I’ve been in those claim centers watching our claims takers get emotional as they’re spending time with every single claimant,” she said.   For now, though, Turnbaulgh remains unsure of what’s coming next.   “I’m sad and I’m worried and I’m scared,” he said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen next; I don’t know where to go from here.”   Here’s a county-by-county breakdown of the 47,545 unemployment claims.   The highest number of claims were in Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, followed by Anne Arundel County and Baltimore city.

The Hubble Space Telescope launched into orbit April 24th, 1990 on the Space Shuttle Discovery.   From capturing the birth of a star to uncovering galaxies millions of light years away, Hubble has gifted the world with some of the most iconic and mind-blowing images of deep space, helping scientists better understand our universe.   “The Hubble Space Telescope basically changed our entire view of where we are in the universe,” says NASA’s Dr. Jennifer Wiseman. She says the telescope is something of a time machine, allowing scientists to see stars and galaxies billions of years old.   The images are answering questions about how the universe formed and how it’s growing. “Those measurements continue today and, in fact, have yielded some recent surprising findings that the expansion rate of the universe is, in fact, starting to accelerate,” Dr. Wiseman says.   Hubble was designed to be improved and has undergone five upgrades in orbit. While the spacecraft was never intended to last forever, researchers believe it still has life left in it. Dr. Wiseman says, “The science instruments are in good shape, the supporting instruments like batteries and gyroscopes are in good shape, and we have clever ways of operating Hubble over the coming years.”   That leaves time to unravel other interstellar mysteries and reveal more breathtaking wonders of the final frontier.   The Hubble Telescope was named for fame astrologer Edwin Hubble. The spacecraft’s successor, the James Webb Telescope, is set to join Hubble in orbit sometime in 2021.

Once authorization is obtained, the person to be tested must schedule an appointment using the state-designated Chesapeake Regional Information System (CRISP).   Tested individuals will receive post-test instructions at the clinic and most test results will be available within two days. Persons arriving at any of these sites without an order from a healthcare provider and a pre-scheduled appointment will not be tested.

Executive producer and director Lesli Linka Glatter has been on the journey with the show since it first aired in 2012 and she is so grateful for the opportunity to play a role in the show’s success.   “You only get a few of these in a career where you have amazing stories and the idea that you want to be in the room with the smartest people and not be the smartest person in the room, said Linka Glatter in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “We have these amazing, complicated, layered characters at the heart of it. Every year, we’ve reinvented the wheel. We’ve gone to a different country and started over again. I think its kept the storytelling very alive and very fresh. We meet with the intelligence community before every season starts.

She doesn’t always do the right thing. In fact, she is dipping into areas that are extremely difficult, but she is always compelling. She is always dedicated to the mission.

In a world of bruising seven-foot giants and freakishly athletic strong men, it is a virtually weightless and invisible virus that is challenging every member of the roster and employee of the company.  Already the coronavirus has forced WWE to tap out of live events and body slammed the idea of holding WrestleMania in front of a packed stadium. For the first time ever, the event was held without a single fan in attendance. Millions of dollars in critical revenue that was being counted on was instead counted out of their bottom line.   There were mass talent layoffs and furloughs for employees.   Television audiences continue to erode as its live broadcasts have lost much of their sizzle because there are no cheers or jeers. There is only silence.   “There’s a lot of things to figure out in this environment,” said Vince McMahon, WWE Chairman and CEO. “It’s brand new for us and for anyone. When there’s no audience, it is a different show. A completely different show.”   During the pandemic, WWE is being forced to re-think the way its television properties are produced and to generate outside-the-box ideas to try to captivate audiences.   >>READ:  ‘Everything’s Just Turned Upside Down, And I Don’t Like It,’ Says Dakota Kai, WWE NXT Superstar   McMahon says his crystal ball is as cloudy as anyone else’s and doesn’t know when — or even  if  ­– things will return to how they once were. In short, it’s impossible to define what the new normal will look like.   But if it sounds like WWE is going down for the count, think again.   The company posted revenue of $291.0 million during the first quarter of 2020, representing a 60 percent year-over-year increase. They also logged a record number of new subscribers to the WWE Network over WrestleMania weekend. The total number of subscribers to the streaming service is up to 2.1 million, which represents a five percent increase over last year’s WrestleMania. The company declined to say how many of those are paying subscribers.   Records were also set for viewership on its digital and social platforms with 967 million video views during the week of WrestleMania.   As for the ratings of  Raw , the company’s flagship show posted a 16 percent decline in viewership during the first three months of the year, but still managed to outperform its broadcast home of USA Network which is down 29 percent during the same time, according to WWE officials.   “As far as the content is concerned [our broadcast partners] totally get that it’s not our fault,” McMahon said when asked whether he thought the company’s television properties were in jeopardy because of the lack of ratings and live crowd. “They’ve lauded what we’re doing because there is nothing out there right now… They have our back as we do theirs.”   McMahon is also confident that ratings will rebound once the audience becomes more familiar with new faces on the roster.   The company’s first quarter financials were largely unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic, because its wrath didn’t cause a seismic shift in live entertainment until mid-March. Additionally, WrestleMania did not occur until the second quarter.   McMahon gave an honest appraisal of the challenges they are facing and the road ahead.   “I think the COVID-19 stuff caught everyone with their pants down,” McMahon said.   Resuming a live touring schedule and attracting fans to arenas will be among the biggest hurdles for WWE to clear once restrictions are lifted. And there is no clear indication as to when that process could begin. Even the prospect of running another major show in Saudi Arabia as far out as November or December is in doubt.   “I don’t know when it’s going to be allowed, and I don’t know what it’s going to look like when it is allowed. I don’t think anyone does,” McMahon said. “Right now we’re just taking it month by month and continue to push it further out every month in terms of when we’re going to do this thing. I really have no crystal ball there at all.”   Still, the company has dates reserved at multiple arenas in the event they can dip their toes back into their previous business model. McMahon is also open to the idea of welcoming fans back to tapings and employing social distancing measures if permitted to do so by state officials.   >>READ:  Latest from the world of Pro Wrestling   Moving forward, finances may get a little cloudier for WWE as stay-at-home orders and restrictions on live events with large crowds drag on.   Such uncertainty is what led to the release of a large number of talents and furloughing of much of its off-camera workforce. In speaking with investors, company executives stressed that the employees had not been laid off and expect the staff reductions are a temporary measure.   With revenue from ticket sales completely dried up, the company is leaning heavily on the massive television contracts that went into effect last October. Live programming has never been more important to WWE and officials are going to great lengths to ensure the safety of its production staff and crew on the closed sets where the shows are being broadcast.   During the taping process, performers are sequestered in a hotel to limit potential exposure to COVID-19 and temperatures are checked as they arrive at the show. Anyone displaying a fever is barred from entering the premises. All employees and wrestlers are also required to fill out a form documenting whether they’ve been exposed to the virus on a weekly basis.   Additional measures include limiting the total number of people on set during the taping, cleaning the ring ropes in between matches, and frequent “pandemic cleanings” of the entire facility and mobile production trucks.   The company is also using long-lasting industrial-strength chemicals to reduce the risk of viral transmission. WWE Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy and Development Paul “Triple H” Levesque revealed the company has contracted with Allied Bio Science to apply a substance capable of continually killing viruses on surfaces for up to 120 days.   “How it was explained to me is that it acts like a sword that punctures the cell wall of the virus or what causes the virus and kills it on contact,” Levesque said.   The veteran performer turned executive added that it remains effective even if additional cleaning chemicals are applied on top of it.   “We’re doing everything we can do for safety and making sure the environment is as good as it could possibly be,” McMahon said.   Both the company and officials in Florida have recently faced criticism as the shows have continued despite the safety measures that have been put in place. McMahon says that contingency plans have been crafted and company officials have identified a number of alternate locations in multiple states to hold tapings should Florida pull the plug.   No matter how things shake out in the future McMahon says he is confident WWE will be able to adapt and continue to roll with the punches for as long as it takes.   “If anyone can figure it out, we will,” McMahon said. “We’re highly adaptable as you’ve seen through the years. Whatever happens, we’re there.”   Investors reacted positively to the update as shares jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading.

(WJZ) —  Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine are testing the effectiveness of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.  The research is part of a larger national study trying to figure out if the drug can prevent people from getting sick after being exposed to those who have tested positive for COVID-19.   READ MORE: NIH starts clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine, drug Trump called COVID-19 “game changer”   President Trump has promoted the drug as a possible treatment for the virus.   “I think we need to find out if this is a potential beneficial role of hydroxychloroquine in COVID,” said Dr. Miriam Laufer with the university.   This study is different, she said, because it looks at how the anti-malaria drug could prevent the spread of the virus rather than treating it after the fact.   The key participants will be people who either live or work with someone who tested positive.   “It may work to prevent infection in the household members,” Laufer said. “The other possibility is it may be treating the infection very early on so that the infection goes away without causing any disease, so it may prevent infection, or it may prevent people from getting sick.”   The University of Maryland is one of six schools nationwide taking part in the study. The process will be entirely remote, with participants speaking with doctors over the phone or via teleconference. Medications will then be delivered, with participants getting either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for 14 days.   Researchers will then study the effects.   With no vaccine ready for the public, experts are rushing to find scientifically-vetted options to prevent the virus.   “I am with everybody else in the world who is so eager to find a treatment for this terrible disease, and in particular a way for us to not have to live in social isolation for so long, but it’s important that we make sure that we do more benefit than harm,” Laufer said.   On Friday, the FDA issued a warning that said hydroxychloroquine should only be used in clinical trials and under medical supervision, warning not doing so could be deadly.

U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett in Baltimore ruled against a grassroots think tank and area activists who asked him to keep the program from taking off, arguing that it violates their First and Fourth Amendment rights. At least one aircraft was expected to begin flights this month, but the department agreed to hold off until the judge ruled on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.   Under the six-month pilot program, up to three planes equipped with cameras will gather images of the city at a rate of one per second to help police investigate murders, nonfatal shootings, armed robberies and carjackings. Weather permitting, the aircraft will fly up to 12 hours a day covering about 90 percent of the city.   The police department has defended the plan as an opportunity to test a crime-fighting tactic as violent crime has continued in Maryland’s largest city, even in the midst of a global pandemic. Philanthropic funds will cover the cost of the program.   More than 300 people were killed in Baltimore in each of the past five years. Eighty-five people have been killed in 2020 as of Friday morning, a tie compared with the same period last year. The area has also tallied 170 nonfatal shootings this year, down 21 compared with the same time last year.   The technology was secretly tested in Baltimore in 2016. Residents and top city officials were unaware of the police-approved test until the media revealed it.   Earlier this month, the think tank and activists filed their federal lawsuit to stop another tryout. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing them. They argue the program infringes upon people’s reasonable expectation of privacy regarding movement, results in indiscriminate searches without a warrant and impedes the right to gather freely.   Under an agreement between the police department and contractor Persistent Surveillance Systems, analysts will use the images gathered by the airplanes as well as data from city-operated street-level cameras, license plate readers and a gunshot detection system to identify crime suspects and their associates.   The Ohio-based contractor will operate the airplanes and employ the analysts.   The nonprofit of Texas billionaires Laura and John Arnold will pay for the planes, their pilots, hangar space and analysts. The couple also paid for the first test.

CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke with Skarsten about this week’s episode and her deep rooted love for all things related to the caped crusader.   MW:  Hi Rachel, new episode of  Batwoman  coming this weekend and I’m curious to know, were you a fan of Batwoman and the whole Batman universe growing up, is that what led you to being part of the show?     RS:  I wasn’t a  B atwoman fan  per se.  I was a  huge  Batman fan .  I think that’s the only time actually that I’ve ever blacked out when I met a celebrity was when I met Adam West .   B ecause as a little girl  Adam West’s  Batman was everything .  I would wake up early to watch the re-runs,  I  had Batman pajamas,   I  still have in my car box my Batmobile;  I was obsessed with Batman .     W hen I was 16 , I  did a show called  Birds Of P rey .  I feel like Batman has followed me through my life .  I don’t know how intentional it was to be on  Bat woman,  but I think it was definitely meant to be .     MW:  W hat was that moment  like  the first time you saw a script and it just said the word “ Bat?”   D id you lose your mind ?     RS:  I think when  I  really lost my mind ,  it was when we were filming .   A ctually ,  I wasn’t even filming that day .  I just happened to be at the art gallery in downtown Vancouver and it was close to the hotel that we were staying on the pilot .  I was actually walking to a store and they had all the trucks and the lights and the  B at signal .  I was like ,   ‘ Oh my gosh , I’m in this show. ’  I t really hit me  then.    That  was very cool .     MW:  That’s awesome. N ow that you’re on the  show,  part of the universe, h ow much fun is it for you to get to play a character like Alice  who ’s  just  a total wild card ?     RS:  I  feel,  and this is no shade to the other characters ,  but  I  really feel that I got the best character .  I love Alice .   S he’s very …  there’s a real human side to her and so she’s very grounded in that which I think is important .   She’s just so  wacky and out there, a ll the sort of facial expressions.   My  mom  would  be like ,   ‘Don’t roll your eyes   at  people .’   N ow it’s to my benefit .   I get to use  all the weapons in my  a rsenal .   I t’s great .     MW:   You  just get to unlearn everything your mom taught you growing up basically .     RS:  [Laughs] Totally.     MW:   T his week’s episode is titled “The  Narrow   E scape .”   C an you tell us about what we’re going to see in this next chapter of the show ?     RS:  T his episode  was  really fun .   It  sort of starts for me a really fun chapter for Alice because she finds herself in  Arkham .   W hich  if  you know anything about the Batman universe it’s this notorious prison for the criminally insane .  I really like it because we see she kind of crashes into all of these other villains from the universe and I think any fan of the comics is going to be so excited to see some of the people that she  meets  there .   I t’s also just interesting to see how she  deals with being in a completely different environment. It’s o ne that’s not in her control in the way that being outside of  Arkham  was .   That  was really fun to do .     MW:   Y eah for me that’s one of the coolest things in all the superhero universes is when the characters come  together,  and you see how they interact with each other .   T hat’s  a  unique thin g   because  a lot of other shows don’t have that .     RS:   N o ,  an d  especially for a character like Alice because she has interacted with a lot of other characters on the show .   A side from  Bat woman th ey’re  sort of civilians and don’t really match her level of insanity ,  her special level of insanity .   But then you  find her in  Arkham  and there’s people who really outdo her .   I t’s an interesting place for Alice to be in and it was really fun for me getting to do scenes with these other actors who were just taking it so far . To  play off of that,   I  had a lot of fun .     MW:   Y ou were  actually  the subdued one  in a scene  for once .     RS:  I was .  I was chill dude .  I was just  with my  butterfly kni ves  chilling  out.      MW:   We  touch ed   on it  a little bit earlier but with everything going on in the world right now ,  what does it mean to you to be able to be on this  show and p rovide people an outlet ,  an escape ,  and get some entertainment?   RS:   T hat’s such a lovely question and I’ve seen a lot of things about when the world finds itself in this circumstance how people turn to artists .   I  feel it is the great responsibility of an artist to be with people in dark times and to either reflect how they’re feeling or to uplift their spirits .   J ust to be on the show that people enjoy and be a part of making them smile even for an hour is an honor .   Really and truly.       MW:  And last question for you today,  Paul Wesley directed this episode can you talk about what that experience was like ?     RS:  Paul was on  The Vampire Diaries .  I think I was the one person in the universe who did not watch  The Vampire Diaries .   Of  course,  I knew who he was but  it’s always interesting meeting someone like that  be cause you sort of think you know what to expect but you don’t at the same time .   H e totally exceeded even my highest expectations .   H e’s so lovely ,  such a beautiful creative .   H e was an actor ,  so he approaches directing from such an actor’s perspective .  I thoroughly ,  thoroughly enjoyed .  I can’t say enough nice things about Paul .   H ow much time do you have ? [laughs]     MW:   A few more  minutes .        RS:  A lright well  Paul also…  n o ,  I really ,  r eally  loved working with him .  It was one of the episodes that I just wish I had been there all day .     MW:  Awesome, I can’t wait to see how that translates Sunday night.

(WJZ) —  Fully easing restrictions on nursing home and hospital visits is one of the last steps that would be undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Hogan’s plan to reopen the state amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Under the  “Road To Recovery” plan Hogan announced Friday , lessening restrictions on visits is considered “high risk” and would be implemented under the third and final stage of the reopening process. The plan said “there is no realistic timeline yet” for reaching that level of reopening, which also includes things like large religious and social gatherings and high-capacity restaurants and bars.   Nursing homes have been hit hard by COVID-19, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of cases tied to facilities across the state.   One of the hardest-hit nursing homes is the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where  as of Monday  there have been 26 deaths from the virus. Eighty-two residents and 39 staff members tested positive.

Some Maryland child center directors and owners said they’re worried they won’t be able to stay open much longer because they haven’t been paid in weeks.   “The funds that we have can maybe get us through another two weeks,” Sue Kruhm, the owner of Peter Pan Learning Center, said.   Maryland Schools Superintendent Karen Salmon ordered most child care providers to close last month when state-imposed coronavirus restrictions began.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Some childcare centers were allowed to remain open for essential workers, but at no cost to families.   Instead, the State Board of Education was supposed to be footing the bill and pay $350 each week per-child under the age of three, and $250 for children over the age of three.   The payments, however, have not yet come.   “When you offer something out and we agree to it, we do expect to get what that agreement is,” Iamani-Angela Rose, the director of Joshua’s Place, said.   Providers said they operate on thin margins and are taking care of fewer kids, meaning less revenue, but the bills for them haven’t stopped coming in.   “We’re still having to pay the utilities, we’re still having to pay the mortgage, we’re still having to buy supplies,” said Carrie Youssi with Peter Pan Learning Center.   On top of that, they said there’s been plenty of confusion, and some aren’t sure what to do next.   “It’s beyond frustrating, it’s overwhelming and sometimes it’s quite saddening,” Rose said.   In a statement released Friday by the Maryland Department of Education, it said, in part:   “The processing time can be attributed to the need to put an entirely new administrative and validation process into place, the volume of invoices and limited staffing.   WJZ has learned that payments will be mailed out next week.   The Maryland Department of Education also said Friday it will be sending out $2,000 grant payments to essential child care providers by the end of next week.

The drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, should only be used in hospitals or clinical trials because they can kill or cause serious side effects, the FDA said. These include serious heart rhythm problems in Covid-19 patients treated with the drugs, especially when they are combined with the antibiotic azithromycin or other medications that can affect the heart.   Baltimore Officials Warns Residents Not To Drink Or Inject Disinfectant After President Trump’s Comments   “We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions,” the FDA said. “Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.”   Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs, despite lack of evidence   He has mentioned the closely related drugs nearly 50 times since mid-March, according to a CNN analysis of his public comments.   The President has said the drugs would be a “game changer” in the fight against coronavirus, but a growing body of evidence suggests they may not help Covid-19 patients at all, and may do more harm than good.   “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,” the FDA said on Friday. A National Institutes of Health panel has also cautioned against their use.   The FDA said it was monitoring serious side effects in coronavirus patients who took the drugs.   In mid-March, the President said that hydroxychloroquine has “been around for a long time, so we know if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.”   But on Friday, the FDA said that “adverse events included abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death.”   In a statement, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said the agency understands that “health care professionals are looking for every possible treatment option for their patients,” but he emphasized that the drugs come with risks.   “While clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for COVID-19,” he said, “there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered.”   The FDA said those risks “may be mitigated when health care professionals closely screen and supervise these patients such as in a hospital setting or a clinical trial,” which is mentioned in an emergency-use authorization for the drugs issued last month.   Growing body of evidence suggests drugs may not help patients at all   Preliminary results from a large study of hydroxychloroquine suggest that the drug “didn’t really have much of an effect on the recovery rate,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday.   The study, sponsored by the New York state Department of Health, looked at about 600 patients at 22 hospitals in the greater New York City area.   Those who took hydroxychloroquine, with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, were no more likely to survive their infections than those who did not, according to David Holtgrave, dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health, who conducted the study.   Like many studies on coronavirus, the research has not yet been peer-reviewed or formally published, but Holtgrave said “we don’t see a statistically significant difference between patients who took the drugs and those who did not.”   Another early study involving the Department of Veterans Affairs found that coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine were no less likely to need mechanical ventilation than those who did not take the drug.   The research, which looked back at patients’ charts to see how they fared, was not a controlled trial. But it found that patients who took hydroxychloroquine had higher deaths rates compared to those who didn’t.   In a similar French study, researchers examined medical records from 181 coronavirus patients who had pneumonia and required supplemental oxygen. About half had taken hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital, and the other half had not.   The study, which was published on a pre-print server before undergoing peer review, found no statistically significant difference in the death rates of the two groups, or in their chances of being admitted to the intensive care unit.   Eight patients who took the drug, though, developed abnormal heart rhythms and had to stop taking it.   Patients taking the drugs for approved reasons should continue doing so, FDA says   The FDA emphasized on Friday that patients taking the drugs for approved reasons should continue taking their medicine as prescribed.   Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria, the agency said, and hydroxychloroquine is also approved for certain autoimmune conditions such as lupus.   “The benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks at the recommended doses for these conditions,” the agency said.

(WJZ) —  Officials at the state and federal levels have been stressing the importance of contact tracing in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, including Howard County’s health officer.  Health Officer  Dr. Maura Rossman said while it can feel intrusive, the information people share is confidential. When a person gets a call from their local health department, the information gathered is only shared with the department to help combat COVID-19.   “ In actuality, contact tracing is one of these old-fashioned methods that public health (officials) have been using for decades to investigate disease and help persons who have (an) infectious disease, prevent transmission to others, and find out about how they got the disease in the first place,” she said.   With contact tracing, a staff member at a local health department will get a report from the state or a health care provider. The contact tracer will then reach out to anyone who has come into recent contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.

Baltimore residents Joan Esparta and Brittani Wynn said they think contact tracing is a good idea to slow the virus.   “It alerts a lot more people,” Esparta said.   “It would be important to see where is the source is coming from or where it’s being spread, ideally to stop it,” Wynn said.

Workplaces can take mitigation measures to lower their own risks, and they should be planning on those now.”   Inglesby said that all these measures will make a big difference when added together collectively, and that Gov.

Saturday, for better or worse, in times of sickness and health, they’ll have the living room ceremony of their dreams.   “We really wanted to be able to see our family and our friends and our loved ones,” Macur said. “So luckily with the explosion of Zoom and all the other video conferencing apps, it’s been awesome. So we’re able to bring everyone together.”   Everyone also includes their dog Nellie.   “I prefer to call her the best dog, but you call her the dog of honor right?”   Thanks to a local florist, seamstress, supportive loved ones and technology, their forever after is zooming forward.   “The material things you have you don’t necessarily always need them,” Macur joked.   And while so much has changed due to COVID-19, their love remains constant.   “A wedding doesn’t really define us, our relationship does,” he said.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan is hoping to lift the stay at home order sometime in May as long as the state’s number of coronavirus-related deaths and hospitalizations begin a downward trend. The governor said he and the state’s experts are looking for that downward trend over a period of 14 days to determine when it’ll be safe to reopen the state.  “I want to stress that each of these recovery stages will need to be instituted in a safe, gradual and effective manner. If we try to rush this and if we don’t do it in a thoughtful and responsible way, it could cause a rebound of the virus, which could deepen the economic crisis for the fiscal problems and slow our economic recovery,” Hogan said.   The keys, or building blocks, to reopening involve expanding testing, more access to personal protective gear, extensive tracing of contacts of those who are positive, and expanding hospital beds, which have already been done across the state.   “As I discussed on Wednesday. We have made considerable progress on all four of the building blocks which needed to be firmly in place before we could consider lifting restrictions,” Hogan said. “First, we have exponentially expanded our testing capability. Second, we are exceeding our goals to increase hospital surge capacity. Third, we are making progress and increasing the supply of PPE. And fourth, we have quadrupled our capability to do contact tracing by building a robust force of 1,000 contact tracers and launching a state of the art contact tracing platform called COVID link.”   “To begin our reopening and recovery, just as soon as we reach the necessary trends in the critical metrics. I’m optimistic that if Marylanders continue. Staying home and continue practicing physical distancing, a little while longer,” Hogan added. “That our numbers could continue to plateau. And I’m hopeful that we could then be able to begin our recovery in early May.”   Stage one would be lifting the stay at home order and it would include reopening of many of our small businesses.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “We would be able to restart many of our lower risk community activities and quality of life improvements changes that could occur during our first stage would include the reopening of certain businesses and retail shops, the reopening of golf courses and recreational boating and fishing, tennis, outdoor religious activities, along with outdoor fitness and gym classes, and the resumption of elective outpatient surgeries and procedures in certain counties with lower cases concentration of cases, local governments could also have additional flexibility to open things including local parks and playgrounds, municipal recreation centers and libraries,” he added.   READ THE GOVERNOR’S FULL PLAN   But those businesses would have to follow appropriate safety protocols. Hogan said these decisions would be based on the ability to continue physical distancing and to continue to limit person-to-person contact.   If stage one activities resume successfully without a spike in deaths, a sustained spike in ICU cases and no significant outbreaks through community transmission, the state can move onto stage two.   People will still need to wear masks or face coverings in public and would have to practice social distancing, officials said.

New One-Stop Maryland Unemployment Site Launches, Already Reporting Issues     Stage two would entail “a larger number of businesses would open, nonessential workers who cannot telework could return to work, and other public activities would be able to come back online. Indoor religious gatherings could resume with perhaps a limited capacity and physical distinct distancing measures.”   At this time, we could return to a more normal structure, Hogan said, adding expanding public transit schedules and the opening of restaurants and potentially bars would come with significant safety restrictions.   The third and final stage would be reinstituting higher risk, activities, such as larger social gatherings, events, religious gatherings and activities at entertainment venues, and a further lessening of restrictions at hospitals, and eventually nursing homes.   The ‘Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery’ is divided into three stages:     STAGE ONE  calls for lifting the stay-at-home order, and involves business, community, religious, and quality of life improvements. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:    Reopening of small shops and certain small businesses   Curbside pickup and drop-off for businesses   Elective medical and dental procedures at ambulatory, outpatient, and medical offices   Limited attendance outdoor religious gatherings   Recreational boating, fishing, golf, tennis, hiking, and hunting   Reopening of car washes   Limited outdoor gym and fitness classes   Outdoor work with appropriate distancing measures   Some personal services           STAGE TWO  will likely be a longer stage of the initial recovery, but will also be the stage when a large number of businesses and activities come back online. Any businesses that reopen during this period would need to comply with strict physical distancing and appropriate safety protocols. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:    Raising the cap on social gatherings   Indoor gyms and fitness classes   Childcare centers   Normal transit schedules   Indoor religious gatherings   Reopening of restaurants and bars with restrictions   Elective and outpatient procedures at hospitals           STAGE THREE  will involve instituting higher-risk activities, but there is no realistic timeline yet for achieving this level. Examples of changes that could be implemented in this stage include:     Larger social gatherings   Reopening of high-capacity bars and restaurants   Lessened restrictions on visits to nursing homes and hospitals   Reopening of entertainment venues   Larger religious gatherings         Hogan heads the National Governors Association, which also put out its own extensive  “Roadmap to Recovery”  this week.

Experts say that’s not unusual in times of uncertainty, and the ability to remember them might actually have to do with getting more sleep. You may also even be able to positively influence those nighttime journeys.   Sleep experts say they’ve seen an uptick in vivid dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the ability to recall them.   “Some of us, we’re actually getting more sleep, and you have more dreams right before you awaken in the morning,” Dr. Carol Ash, a sleep specialist with RWJBarnabas Health, said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Stay-at-home mom Stephanie Klein says she’s never had more vivid dreams than the ones she’s experienced over the last several weeks.   “They’re not nightmares, but they more than once have left me drenched in sweat and having like a real physiological response,” Klein said. “I’ve been able to write them down pretty accurately.”   In a Harvard survey, more than 2,000 people described 5,000 COVID-19 related dreams in the last month.   Harvard psychologist Dr. Deirdre Barrett is collecting those dreams. Dr. Barrett says she’s seeing clusters of particular themes.   “There are lot of these ‘Oh my God I have it and maybe I’m gonna die’ and then there are a lot of dreams that have metaphors for the virus, every kind of bug attacking the dreamer,” Barrett said.   Dr. Barrett adds most Americans are having general-anxiety dreams, while healthcare workers are experiencing more post-traumatic type nightmares.   Experts say one function of dreams is to help us emotionally process what we experience in our waking hours. And some say there are actually ways to influence what happens when you close your eyes.   “Just as you fall asleep you can image whatever it is you want to dream about very vividly,” Dr. Barrett said. “And that greatly increases the odds you’ll have the dream you’re requesting.”   Sleep experts also suggest simple ways to set yourself up for good shut-eye:     Keep the same wake up and bedtime   Shut off electronics an hour before bed   Get outside   Reduce your sugar and carb intake     Dr. Barrett recommends sharing your dreams as a way to reach out and connect while we’re all apart.

The network premieres its new series “ Penny Dreadful: City of Angels ” starring Nathan Lane, Natalie Dormer,  Daniel Zovatto , and Adam Rodriguez. The show is set in Los Angeles during the 1930s and focuses on the social and political tension of the time, the rise of radio evangelism, and the powerful forces that attempt to pull a Mexican-American family apart.   While Rodriguez has been on hit shows like “CSI: Miami” and “Criminal Minds,” this series spoke to him a deep way and he’s excited for people to check out the fascinating world that Showtime has built.   “This is the most incredible production I’ve ever worked out,” said Rodriguez in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “Set design, cinematography, costumes, props, the material itself and what’s being said through the writing and the cast. There are some important themes that people really need to pay attention to right now more than ever. I’m really excited for people to get a chance to see this show and hopefully fall in love with it.”   FULL INTERVIEW:   Rodriguez says this show is a great example of how some things remain the same even when so many things have changed over the years in our society.   “What continues to fascinate me is as a species, we seem to not be quick learners,” said Rodriguez. “This show takes place in 1938 and here we are 92 years later and we’re dealing with all the same challenges without having made very much progress in almost 100 years. We’re dealing with compromising people who we believe have lesser value than us and we come up with every reason under the sun to decide why they have lesser value. They have a different socioeconomic class, different skin color, different ethnic origin, you name it. We do that as human beings and it makes it easy to really dehumanize people and move them out of the way for whatever we think out grand cause is.”   “Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels” premieres Sunday, April 26 at 10pm EST/PST on Showtime.

The Baltimore Ravens entered the three-day draft with eight picks but ended up bringing home ten players after some wheeling and dealing.   Before the draft, General Manager Eric DeCosta said he likes to have a lot of picks. The team ended up dividing those picks equally between offense and defense.   The Ravens’ biggest needs going into the draft were at linebacker, offensive line and wide receiver. Having ten picks allowed them to grab two players at each of those positions. The wide receivers will help quarterback Lamar Jackson diversify the passing game.   The team also added two players to the defensive line, bringing some youth to that group after signing a pair of veteran free agent defensive lineman in Calais Campbell and Derek Wolfe.   The Ravens will also sign a number of undrafted players and they have a long history of having someone from that group make the team.   Overall, it’s a class “packed with potential,” WJZ’s Mark Viviano said.

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)   The Ravens had never before picked a player from the powerhouse Louisiana State University football program. Patrick Queen changed that.   It all went according to plan for the Ravens: Queen was the guy they wanted and the guy they needed. He fills a need at inside linebacker.   Queen was the defensive MVP in the National Championship game, and it looked like he’d stay in Louisiana and get drafted by the New Orleans Saints. The Saints passed, though, and the Ravens got their man.   Queen said he doesn’t mind leaving home to start his NFL career in Baltimore.     J.K. Dobbins : running back, Ohio State University (Round Two, 55th overall pick)     GLENDALE, ARIZONA – DECEMBER 28: Running back J.K.

The Tigers defeated the Buckeyes 29-23. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)   With the emphasis on defense in the first round, the Ravens went for offense in the second round, picking up another big-time player from another big-time football school.   At Ohio State, Dobbins set a Buckeyes record with more than 2,000 rushing yards this past season, scoring 21 touchdowns.   One of the top running backs in college football now joins a Ravens offense that set the record for most rushing yards in a season, teaming up with quarterback Lamar Jackson and running backs Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill.     Justin Madubuike : defensive tackle, Texas A&M University (Round Three, 71st overall pick)     ARLINGTON, TEXAS – SEPTEMBER 28: Justin Madubuike #52 of the Texas A&M Aggies during the Southwest Classic at AT&T Stadium on September 28, 2019 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)   It was back to defense for the Ravens’ first pick of the third round, taking big defensive tackle Justin Madubuike.   Madubuike was very emotional when he found out the Ravens picked him and said he had a feeling Baltimore would call.   At six-foot-three and 300 pounds, Madubuike is very mobile. That helped him earn second-team All-SEC this past season.   Madubuike comes to a Ravens franchise with a rich history on defense.     Devin Duvernay: wide receiver, University of Texas (Round Three, 92nd overall pick)   Malik Harrison: linebacker, Ohio State University (Round Three, 98th overall pick)   Tyre Phillips: offensive tackle, Mississippi State University (Round Three, 106th overall pick)   Ben Bredeson : offensive guard, University of Michigan (Round Four, 143rd overall pick)     ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN – NOVEMBER 17: Ben Bredeson #74 of the Michigan Wolverines leaves the field after a 31-20 win over the Indiana Hoosiers at Michigan Stadium on November 17, 2018 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

He was a team captain at Michigan where he played for Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, the brother of Ravens Head Coach John Harbaugh.   Bredeson is the mix in the Ravens’ search to fill the vacancy left by Marshal Yanda.

(Photo by John E. Moore III/Getty Images)   Washington was the second defensive lineman the Ravens picked up in the draft and the fourth the team picked up this off-season after they picked up veterans Calais Campbell and Derrick Wolfe.     James Proche: wide receiver, Southern Methodist University (Round Six, 201st overall pick)     DALLAS, TEXAS – NOVEMBER 09: James Proche #3 of the Southern Methodist Mustangs is tackled by Ja’Quan McMillian #21 of the East Carolina Pirates in the first half at Gerald J.

Purring puffs of fluff who can’t wait to snuggle with pet parents miraculously home all day. These are the images we may have of sheltering with our pets during the age of coronavirus.  For some pets, that may well be true. For others used to more regular routines and serious alone time, the sudden reality of 24/7 intimacy could be nerve-racking, even catastrophic, especially if there are small children in the home.   “It can be overwhelming for pets when kids are home all the time, especially infants and toddlers. which is why they should never be left alone with the pet, not even for 30 seconds,” said Dr. John Howe, the president of the  American Veterinary Medical Association .   “Even the nicest dog in the world can bite. In fact there are 4.5 million dog bites a year in America, and over 800,000 of them need medical attention,” Howe said. “Over half the bites are to children, and it’s usually a serious injury when it happens to a child.   “Dogs and cats really need a safe place where they feel comfortable, where they can go and not be bothered,” he said, “especially if there’s children in the house.”   We transfer our stress, too   To make matters worse, many of us humans   are incredibly stressed right now.   We’re worried about our health and that of our loved ones during the pandemic. We’re working long hours from home or fretting over the loss of a job. We’re going stir crazy from social isolation or tense from being with the same people without a break.   While we may think we’re handling all that well, our pets will recognize our tension and anxiety — and may make it their own.   “You might think you’re internalizing everything, but what we know from studies on both humans and animals is that we are not. There’s physical manifestations that are probably even more obvious to our dogs and cats than ourselves,” said Dr. Dana Varble, the chief veterinary officer for the North American Veterinary Community.   “Their emotions can be a reflection of ours because they are so tightly bonded with us,” said veterinarian Dr. Meredith Montgomery, a clinical assistant professor of shelter medicine at the University of Florida.   Montgomery, who specializes in decreasing stress for shelter dogs and cats, has seen it firsthand while isolating with four medically rescued cats and a dog.   Her cats have not reacted well to the constant din and boundless energy of her two-year-old toddler, who’s now home instead of at day care most of the day.   “None of my cats particularly enjoy each other. So what’s been very important for us in keeping a peaceful household is that they all have their own space within the home,” Montgomery said.   She’s done that by using baby gates to provide some respite and encourages “vertical space within the home and giving each cat access to established areas, like boxes, where they can hide.”   How to tell if your pet is stressed   Realize that there aren’t specific signs that will apply to every dog or cat, experts said.   “Just like us, every dog or cat is an individual,” Montgomery said. “So not only are different things going to stress them, but they also might have different and unique thresholds for stress.”   Stressed dogs can startle, jumping at the slightest sound or movement. Some shake and shiver, vocalize excessively or drool. They can use self-calming techniques, such as yawning, lip licking, excessive grooming or spinning.   Oddly, tense and upset dogs can also look depressed, showing a lack of appetite or energy. At times they can get diarrhea or urinate or defecate more often. And, of course, dogs can become uncharacteristically aggressive, snapping or growling.   Cats, on the other hand, are more difficult to read, said experts. You have to look for more subtle signs, such as overgrooming, increased vocalization, lack of appetite, hiding or acting standoffish and, of course, suddenly ignoring their litter box.   “Cats will usually give you some little hint and if you ignore it, that’s when they start to poop on the bed, pee on the couch, go outside the litter box,” Howe said.   While you should always check with your vet to make sure there’s no urinary infection, stress itself can cause significant problems, he said.   “In fact, sometimes cats get a hemorrhagic cystitis where they start peeing blood, and it’s just from stress, not from infection,” Howe said.   Help your dog and cat calm down   It’s all about routine.  For both species, the main solution is to stick to a regular regimen, just as you would do with a young child, experts said.   “They love to have the same routine,” Howe said. “Getting up at the same time, eating at the same time, playing at the same time. That’s the key.”   Use pet gates and crates.  If a dog is crate trained, it can be very soothing for them to go back to their own special place, Howe said.   “They’re safe, they’re comfortable, and it’s an opportunity for them to practice independence in their own space,” he said. The use of baby and pet gates or barriers can also help keep pets and children separated, he added.   “Gates are so good to have while you’re doing something like cooking, when you can’t give the kids or dog direct supervision,” Howe said.   Play species-specific music. It’s actually true that music does soothe the savage soul.   “Something that I use in the shelters and high-volume spay-neuter facilities that I’ve worked in is playing music,” Montgomery said. “I have used slow-paced classical music at a low volume for ‘quiet hour’ with shelter dogs.”   She said that allows them time for decompression with a food puzzle or “treat-filled Kong, providing a healthy, appropriate chewing outlet.”   There are even species-specific tunes. A  study published in 2015  found that cats preferred such feline-favorite sounds such as chirping, purring and the sucking sound of nursing kittens, mixed in with some classical music strains. You and your cat can listen  here , while Spotify and other websites provide  playlists  for dogs.   Keep grooming and playing.  Dogs need regular exercise and playtime with their owners, experts said. If you’re suddenly sitting on your couch all day instead, you’ll soon see the signs of distress in your pet.   Cats, too, need daily play that mimics what they would do in the wild. Playing with toys such as feather spinners and puzzles that contain treats can energize cats and keep them happy.   “Play with them, stimulate their hunting instincts, then feed them,” Howe suggested. After all, big cats in the wild rest after a good hunt and a full tummy.   Hopefully, grooming is part of your regular routine as good health care for your dog or cat. When it comes to calming, if your cat likes to be brushed, that’s often a winner.   “Grooming is very soothing to most cats,” Howe said.   Check your litter box etiquette.  Most cat owners already know they need to keep the litter boxes sparkling clean by scooping often. Cat are also very sensitive to the type of litter (most like sandy or clay-based) and scent (they prefer no scent). The litter box should be big enough for the cat to turn around in — bigger is better — and there should be a litter box on every level of your home. And if you have multiple cats?   “If you have two cats, you have three litter boxes spaced throughout the house, if you have three cats, add another,” Montgomery said.   The rule is to always have one more litter box than the total number of cats in the home. It’s also a good idea not to have a covering on a litter box, especially in multi-cat households, as cats feel most vulnerable while urinating or defecating, experts said.   Use positive, not negative reinforcement.  Having a dog rip up clothing or paper or your cat starting to scratch the couch or either species offering a sudden “gift” of pee or poop may seem like a personal affront, but experts said you should never take it personally.   “Dogs, and potentially cats, may be experiencing severe anxiety, which results in these fear-based or anxiety-based behaviors,” Montgomery said. “But it’s not some form of retribution against the owners. It’s because they’re experiencing a really heightened emotional state.”   Positive reinforcement, such as providing treats when the cat does go in the litter box or the dog poops outside, is the best way to solve behavior problems, experts said.   “Unfortunately one of the harder things to do is to ignore bad behavior,” Varble said. “But say your dog is bugging you, constantly nudging you. If they give up and they go away to their bed, it’s really important at that moment to go over to your dog and say, ‘Oh, good dog sitting on your bed. Do the petting there, reinforce that.”   Keep trying .  If problems continue, veterinarians want you to reach out, as they are quite used to helping owners with such behaviors. Vets may suggest pheromone diffusers   — made for both dogs and cats — that you can put in the home to promote relaxation and calm nerves. Your vet may prescribe   additional anxiety medications, or your vet may suggest a consultation with a behavioral specialist.   “The American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, ACVB, has a  great website  to find a veterinary behavioral expert that can do a consult with you,” Varble said. “And some of those behaviorists are already set up to do via the phone or video.”   Getting your pet ready for your return to work   Again, routine is king. “Try and maintain some sort of typical work schedule as best you can right now,” said Varble. “The more that we stick to typical work schedule and routine, the better our pets are going to adapt when we go back to work.”   That includes feeding, exercising, playing and grooming at about the same times each day, experts said. But if you’ve fallen off schedule while sheltering (and who hasn’t), don’t fret.   “If you know you’re going to go back to work in 10 days or so, start getting yourself and your animal on a more typical schedule,” Montgomery said. “Focus on doing things that you have been doing, like taking them for a short walk, and make sure you’re still fitting in those activities after your return to work.”   Consider crate training:  If you haven’t taught your dog how to stay in a crate, that might be a good choice now, experts said.   “Now while you’re still home, get your dog used to being in the crate,” Howe said. “You can still walk by and talk to your dog, but getting them used to the crate if you can’t leave them loose is very important.”   Keep up the playtime.  Just because you’re not there in the house all day doesn’t mean you can’t have “quality time” with your pet, experts said.   “What may this look like? Ten to 30 minutes of play with a favorite wand toy, special brushing session (if liked by your pet), a walk with your leashed dog, or time spent with a favorite toy playing fetch or tug-of-war,” Montgomery said, adding that her older dog enjoys “getting one-on-one time for ear scratches with her favorite person.”   As for pets with high energy, finding them an appropriate outlet can be important, she said.   “Daytime, individual dog-walking services may be beneficial as people return to nonessential services,” Montgomery said. “Providing food-filled Kongs or feeding toys and puzzles for cats and dogs can also be a way to keep their minds happy and engaged while we are away at work.”   Reach out to your vet.  Veterinarians want pet owners to reach out for help, both during coronavirus and after.   “We have a lot of information for the pet-owning public created by veterinarians on our  website,  and they can also find  COVID-19-specific information  as well,” Howe said.

It’s one of the safety measures that’s being taken in an unprecedented Maryland election on Tuesday that will only have three places for in-person voting out of concern for the coronavirus, as election officials are strongly urging eligible voters to mail in their ballots in a single race to decide who will serve the rest of the term of the late U.S. Rep.

More than 77,000 already have been turned in. More than half of the vote could be released on the state elections board website shortly after the 8 p.m. poll close on Tuesday.   Precautions due to the virus in this special election have thrust the candidates into unknown campaign territory in the time of a pandemic.   Fundraising has been tough. Candidates haven’t been able to reach voters with traditional techniques like door-to-door campaigning or large events. Both candidates say they have been trying to reach voters more through social media.   The majority-black district that includes a large portion of Baltimore as well as parts of its suburbs in Baltimore and Howard counties is heavily Democratic, with more than four Democrats for each Republican.   Klacik, the Republican who has appeared on Fox News and caught President Donald Trump’s attention with her social media posts that prompted the president to describe the district as a “ disgusting rat and rodent infested mess ,” said the pandemic has made it difficult to campaign. But the 38-year-old believes she has an edge on the 71-year-old Mfume in the realm of social media.   “I don’t think he was really on social media platforms previously, so I felt like we had a little bit of an advantage that way, but, at the same time, he has such a big name,” Klacik said. “So, we’re basically trying to shout out loud on social media how we can make a positive impact against basically an incumbent, because he had the seat prior to Congressman Cummings.”   Mfume, a former NAACP head who held the U.S. House seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, said he also has been working hard on social media. The man who won his first race for Baltimore City Council in 1978 by three votes said he’s not taking anything for granted in the uncertain times.   “It probably concerns me more, because I recognize how elections can be close — even when you don’t think that they are going to be,” Mfume said.   Some of the leading issues both candidates have been campaigning on include health care, reducing crime and promoting job creation.   Mfume supports stronger gun-control measures and focusing on root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. He has been advocating for greater support for apprenticeships to develop skills for young people to find work.   Klacik has been advocating to help struggling parts of Baltimore through a federal program known as opportunity zones. The program, which is supported by Trump, focuses on increasing private investment in distressed communities with tax incentives for people who invest in real estate projects and operate businesses in designated low-income communities.   Only three in-person voting centers will be open Tuesday for voters who can’t vote by mail, such as the disabled or the homeless, though other eligible voters can cast ballots in person if they choose.   Voting centers are being prepared to comply with social distancing guidelines.   “Things will be very spread apart,” said Nikki Charlson, the state election board’s deputy administrator. “The poll workers will be sanitizing the surfaces.”   The winner will run as an incumbent in the state’s crowded June 2 primary for a full term. Ballots for the primary will be mailed to Maryland voters in early to mid-May, very soon after Tuesday’s election.   “That just seems a little strange and foreign. It’s because it really is,” Mfume said. “We’ve never had anything like this in the state before.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

(Capital News Service) —  Learning has changed in Maryland since the coronavirus outbreak. Teachers and students have been forced to turn to online platforms across all education levels due to the closing of classrooms.   Last week, the Maryland State Department of Education extended its closure of public school systems through at least May 15.   “This is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators, and state,” Maryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost said, pointing to challenges such as technology access and food insecurity that hamper distance education for some students. “This type of learning is no substitute for in-person learning, and we will need to be thoughtful and serious about how we help students recover from this crisis.”   Higher-education institutions within the University System of Maryland and around the state had already moved to online-only at least for the rest of the spring semester.   “What we had to do was really set expectations,” Montgomery County Public Schools spokesman Derek Turner told Capital News Service. “First we need to focus on student health and wellness, and then we need to focus on what a new world of instruction looks like.”   K-12 education faces some of the toughest challenges. There is a wide array of ages and behaviors among students, and varying access to online platforms, according to Turner.   Montgomery County schools have loaned out more than 43,000 Chromebook laptops to students in order to give them access to the online learning environments, according to Turner.   “The biggest problem we’re facing is internet connectivity,” Turner said. “We’re constantly looking for opportunities to make sure we are closing gaps in the digital divide.”   Montgomery County Public Schools has been working with Comcast to allow students to access the internet and has been purchasing hotspot devices for those who lack local connections. Lockheed Martin donated $25,000 to the school system toward the purchase of more mobile hotspots, according to Turner.   Keeping to a schedule can also be a challenge — for teachers and students.   Anne Arundel County Public Schools, for example, published a suggested daily calendar for students. Each calendar — for elementary, middle and high school levels — gave guidance as to how students could tackle their days at home in the online environment.   “The notion is that we wanted to build a structure for students that was flexible and provided structure and support for them,” Anne Arundel schools spokesman Bob Mosier said.   Colleges and universities across the state took recommendations from the University System of Maryland, which on March 10 announced they were shutting down campuses and moving classes online. This policy has stayed in place for the remainder of the semester.   Many have attempted to ease pressure on students by implementing campus-wide changes to grading policies. The University of Maryland, College Park implemented a pass/fail system, Towson University implemented its Pass Grading Option and Salisbury University opted for a pass/no pass system.   “Working in concert with some of the other University System of Maryland schools, it was determined that, for this semester only, that it would be a good option for some of our students” who have been disrupted by having to take classes online and/or the virus affecting their personal lives, Salisbury University spokesman Jason Rhodes said.   “We know this is a stressful time for a lot of students, as well as faculty and staff, and we’re always looking to do the right thing for our university community,” Rhodes said.   Rhodes also mentioned that Salisbury, and likely other University System of Maryland campuses, had a pandemic plan in place that was drafted when the avian flu and swine flu presented threats in 2008 and 2009, respectively, so the transition was not unforeseen.   “This is the first time that we’ve had to put that (plan) into action,” Rhodes said. “And certainly once this is all over, there’ll be a debrief about what can be done different, what can be done better, next time. But this is something that we prepared for and we’re certainly happy that we did.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.1072315689361144, "subjectivity": 0.38954955398137214, "wordcount": 675}

It might be time to reconsider, experts say, especially if that extra effort is adding to your daily stress. Even the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is re-emphasizing there’s no real risk of getting the virus that causes Covid-19 that way.   “We want to assure you there is currently NO evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the #COVID19,” the agency tweeted recently.   Jamie Lloyd-Smith is one of the scientists who worked on the  only study to analyze  how long SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, might remain on various surfaces.   Despite the fact his research found the virus might live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and metal and plastic for two to three days, Lloyd-Smith doesn’t bother to wipe down his own groceries or takeout.   “I don’t, personally,” Lloyd-Wright said. “I treat my hands as potentially contaminated while I’m handling the groceries and unpacking them and I make sure that I wash them fully when I’m done with that process.”   Virologist Dr. John Williams, who has studied coronaviruses for decades, is also not overly concerned.   “Personally, we’re alternating cooking food at home and getting takeout food for a houseful of kids home from college right now,” Williams said. “And we’re not wiping down the containers from the restaurant.”   Because the odds of someone coming along and depositing enough virus on a grocery item or takeout container are pretty low, “I view it as sort of a hypothetical risk,” Lloyd-Smith said.   “So yes, I’m careful, I’ll wash my hands, but I don’t sort of regard it as glowing radioactively with virus.”   His advice might change, said Lloyd-Smith, if the person was at high risk from the virus, such as elderly or immunocompromised.   “One reasonable and easy-to-implement precaution for groceries that don’t need refrigeration is simply to let them sit for a day or more before unpacking them,” he said. “This will vastly reduce the level of any contamination that is present.”   How did we get so concerned about groceries?   The concern over virus transmission via surfaces began in late March after the study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.   “What the study showed is that under certain conditions in the laboratory, which are obviously kind of artificial, SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel,” Lloyd-Smith said.   The experiment did not account for other factors that could help to inactivate the virus, such as sunlight or disinfectants or look at varying levels of virus, Lloyd-Smith said, so there’s no “magic” in the numbers they found.   Food safety expert Benjamin Chapman agreed. “There’s no magic number in this because temperature matters, humidity matters, how much virus was put there in the first place matters,” said Chapman, a professor in the department of agricultural and human sciences at North Carolina State University.   The amount of SARS-CoV-2 also diminished rather quickly over time, compared to say, a norovirus or “cruise-ship” intestinal virus, said Williams, who is chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.   In the study the virus was down “a hundred fold on cardboard in eight hours,” Williams said. “That means 99% of the virus was gone by eight hours, and the same is true on stainless steel and plastic.”   “The cruise ship norovirus, however, can persist for many days in an environment on inanimate objects,” Williams added. “So you could be on a cruise and have norovirus and then your cruise finishes and I get on the next cruise in your cabin and I can get your norovirus.”   Washing hands is key   If you want to focus on something that makes a key difference every time, experts say, it’s much more important to become a fanatic about properly washing or sanitizing your hands after any potential encounter with coronavirus.   Instead of worrying about how long the virus will persist and spraying everything down or wiping it down with sanitizer, you can manage this “very unlikely route with low risk and make it even lower by just practicing proper good hand washing,” said Chapman, “or using hand sanitizer once you’ve returned home from the grocery store or gotten takeout food.   “I don’t want to discount this conversation or people’s fears, but it’s almost like it doesn’t matter much as long as everyone is washing their hands,” Chapman added.   If you are still really nervous about your risk of contamination by food products, then by all means use disinfectant wipes on the outside of containers, Williams said.   “Some people want to wear a belt and suspenders to hold their pants up, right?” Williams said.   “So if people are concerned about virus transmission from groceries or take out food, just carefully remove the inside containers of food from the outer bag, throw away the outer bag and then use a little hand gel or soap and water.   “But still, the odds of getting the virus that way are very, very low,” Williams added.

(WJZ) —  During an appearance on CBS’ Face The Nation Sunday, Gov. Larry Hogan said President Donald Trump’s recent messaging during White House Coronavirus Taskforce briefings has “not been great.”  This comes after President Trump’s remarks at Thursday’s White House briefing that he’s seen that disinfectant “knocks it [COVID-19] out in a minute. And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs — so it’ll be interesting to check that… It sounds interesting to me.”     Gov. Hogan said he has raised concerns multiple times about conflicting messaging during these briefings.   “I think it’s always critically important for a leader to put out the facts and to be as open and honest and transparent as possible,” Gov. Hogan said. “That’s what I’ve tried to do as the governor of my state, particularly in the middle of this crisis. I think that it’s critical that the President of the United States, when people are really scared and in the middle of this worldwide pandemic, that in these press conferences, we really get the facts out there. Unfortunately, some of the messaging has not been great.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Gov. Hogan also said that Maryland has received hundreds of calls from residents asking about injecting or ingesting disinfectants as a treatment to coronavirus.     . @GovLarryHogan  on inaccurate information from  @realDonaldTrump  this week: “It’s always critically important for a leader to put out the facts,” notes that the state received \"hundreds\" of calls asking about ingesting disinfectants due to trump's \"mixed messages\"  pic.twitter.com/CZEmlCvVn6   — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation)  April 26, 2020     “It’s hard to imagine that people thought that was serious, but people were actually thinking about this,” Gov. Hogan said. “People were thinking about: Is this something you could do to protect yourself?”   He added that having briefings to inform people about what is happening in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic is important.   “I think having briefings to inform the public of what’s going on is important,” Gov. Hogan said. “And I think [President Trump’s] coronavirus team has really been doing a good job, and there’s some really smart folks on there that are providing valuable information.

(AP/WJZ) —  One of Maryland’s largest counties on Sunday asked a federal judge to throw out a civil rights group’s lawsuit that claims its jail has failed to stop an “uncontrolled” coronavirus outbreak or properly care for infected prisoners.  The class-action suit filed Tuesday by Civil Rights Corps claims Prince George’s County Jail prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are isolated in cells with walls covered in feces, mucus and blood.   “They are barely monitored and receive no real treatment,” the suit says.   The Washington, D.C.-based group’s suit asks the court to order the immediate release of medically vulnerable prisoners. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Greenbelt, Maryland, instructed the county to file a written response to the suit’s claims before she rules.   In a court filing Sunday, attorneys for the county said jail officials acted proactively to protect inmates and staff from the virus.   READ MORE: Maryland Releases 2,000 Inmates To Slow Spread Of COVID-19 Behind Bars   Mary Lou McDonough, director of the county’s corrections department, “led the way” among correctional facilities in Maryland to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, county officials wrote.   The county says the jail’s average daily population has dropped from 720 to 560 inmates since March 1, with 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the jail population.   None of the infected inmates have been hospitalized, and 10 of them have fully recovered and returned to the jail’s general population, the county says.   McDonough is the only defendant named in the suit.   Civil Rights Corps has filed similar suits over conditions at jails in Miami, Dallas, Chicago and Detroit.   For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.   For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and even death.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Dr. Chronis-Tuscano also said it’s ok to give yourself a break if you’re not operating at your best.   “For those of us trying to work from home, and homeschool kids, I think we need to be really kind to ourselves and set realistic expectations,” she said.   If things start to feel like too much to handle, you should contact your doctor and look into TeleHealth.   “[You’re] able to do so much right now in terms of TeleHealth, and this is certainly a time when the use of TeleHealth is very wide spread,” Dr. Chronis-Tuscano said.

And bathrooms are perhaps the one crucial point in the house where all humans — and therefore microbes — pass through. So during the present pandemic, keeping your toilets, sinks, counters and showers as germ-free as possible is key to keeping you and your family healthy.   The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is known to live on hard surfaces for up to three days, according to data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Your bathroom has plenty of those.   “We’d be mostly concerned with the inanimate surfaces,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.   “Any household disinfectants will work against this virus,” he said. “And soap and water work perfectly well.”   We’ve got a guide to help you think about the area of your house that could become ground zero of the fight against coronavirus.   Make sure you follow the right steps   As you get ready to clean your bathroom, start by making sure to wash your hands.   If you’re using disinfectants, you should pick higher-quality ones. The US Environmental Protection Agency released a five-page list of disinfectants — including Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and certain Lysol sprays — which are strong enough to defeat “harder to kill” viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.   It’s important to focus on cleaning “high-touch” areas of your bathroom including light switches, doorknobs and the sink areas in particular. That can also include less obvious areas everyone in the house likely touches, including showerheads, shower curtains and around the toilet seat.   Anything that people touch should be cleaned, whether they have symptoms or not. That includes hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, shavers or other appliances in the bathroom. (You may not have touched razors recently if you’re trying to grow out a gnarly quarantine beard.)   We know you would  never  forget this, but just a friendly reminder not to forget to make sure devices are assuredly  unplugged  and  turned off  before you embark on a deep clean.   You should consider placing a wipeable cover on electronic devices if you can, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises, and try to use a solution that’s at least 70% alcohol.   It pays to be thorough, because droplets capable of carrying the virus can really get around within your bathroom.   For instance, one study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology showed that particles and droplets can be spread up to 6 feet when you flush with the seat up.   Follow the cleaning product maker’s directions   “You don’t have to panic clean,” said Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the American Cleaning Institute. But he emphasized that you need to make sure you’re cleaning correctly.   After you wipe down hard surfaces like sinks and counter tops, make sure to leave them wet for 3 to 5 minutes. Who knew? Turns out, the professionals do. The American Cleaning Institute recommends letting the surfaces air-dry, and then rinse them with water.   People aren’t aware of the need to wait, said Sansoni, who noted that’s important to give the cleaning products time to actually work and thoroughly kill germs or viruses.   Think there’s no way you’re doing it wrong? Sansoni cited findings from an Ipsos poll his organization commissioned, which found that 42% of Americans weren’t cleaning or disinfecting the right way — and could be leaving themselves vulnerable.   Many people aren’t following directions printed on product labels, including allowing cleaning products enough time to work, he said. Please make sure you’re abiding by the instructions on your products, and that you’re using them as the manufacturer intended.   Use separate bathrooms if a family member is sick   If a family member or roommate living with you is showing Covid-19 symptoms, it’s important to assign them their own specific bathroom and to separate that person from others.   If you don’t have more than one bathroom, have the person with symptoms clean surfaces they’ve touched after they use the bathroom, according to the CDC.   If they’re too sick to clean, your second option is to have a healthy person clean the area. Wait as long as you can before entering, wear a mask and gloves to clean and wash the mask and your clothes after cleaning. (Toss the gloves.)   That might not be an option if your patient needs help using the bathroom.   “You may have to help the person use the facilities,” Schaffner said. “You can assign one person in the family to help them and to establish their routine.”   If you’re in close quarters with someone showing Covid-19 symptoms, you absolutely must protect yourself with a mask at minimum, he emphasized.   Protect yourself if you’re helping a sick family member   In addition to a mask, Schaffner recommended wearing gloves and some sort of other garment over your regular clothes if you’re caring for an ill person in the bathroom. “Watch the person, see what they touch, and wipe that off,” he said.   That could include the toilet seat, which may receive a lot of action since diarrhea and vomiting are common Covid-19 symptoms.   As an additional precaution, Schaffner also recommended placing any sanitizing wipes you use in a plastic bag and throwing that in the garbage. Then change your clothes after you’re done cleaning the bathroom or helping someone else use it.   If someone in your home is sick, it’s especially important to wash any of their towels or dirty clothes separately.   For towels, bath mats, cloth shower curtains and other soft materials, the CDC recommends laundering them according to the manufacturer’s directions with the “warmest appropriate water setting.” Then dry those items completely.   Soap can work even better than disinfecting products   “By now you know that viruses, including the coronavirus, can live on surfaces for awhile — several hours, even several days — which means we have to be cleaning all the time,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in a video.   That gets complicated when you’re burning through disinfectants and sanitizing wipes, and store shelves with those products are all to often bare.   But you may already have soap at home, and it could be easier to find in a supermarket. And the good news? “Many scientists argue it’s actually a better alternative,” Gupta said.   There’s scientific backing for this thinking: At a microscopic level, the novel coronavirus is surrounded by a “lipid envelope.” Soap works on the virus by tearing through that layer of lipids that surrounds the proteins inside and breaking apart the virus.   The process is similar to how dish soap eats away at grease on a pan in ways that plain water can’t.   Finish the job correctly   Finishing the cleaning job right is crucial.   Gupta explained that you don’t necessarily have to wear gloves as you clean.   But if you do, make sure when you’re done to remove them by sliding your finger in underneath their opening so you don’t touch the exposed outer side with your bare hands.   And then wash your hands one last time after you’ve thrown away your gloves.   The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The author loves the progress that has been made in the conversation about mental health and knows there is still work to be done.   “I’ve always been forthright with the illnesses I struggle with,” said Gotch in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “I feel like somehow I’ve been in this protective bubble. The people in my orbit have always been quite open about it [mental health.] People are now aware of it. The conversations maybe aren’t where we want them to be, but there is a growing awareness. We have a long way to go, but we’re much better than we were when I started my journey 20 or 30 years ago. Right now, there are a lot of people dealing with mental health issues they’ve never had before. I do think this will open up conversations in a more public way because there is a larger mass of people dealing with this.”   FULL INTERVIEW:   While Gotch addresses many important topics in her book, one of the most important is valuing her mental health and self care at work with ban.do and in professional settings.   “My job now is my first job in a professional setting. I started at 36 and I was a freelancer for a long time. Photoshoots are professional, but it’s more of a relaxed thing,” said Gotch. “Going into this work, I didn’t even know there was a stigma against emotions in the workplace. I’ve always operated from that place. I realized that we had something special here and we could model a workplace with emotions. I’m not advocating for walking around and sobbing every day or if you’re in a bad mood, lashing out at everyone. The key is understanding our own emotions and having emotional intelligence.

The gunman was fatally wounded by a deputy who responded to a 911 call and fired a single shot at the suspect, according to Richardson.   Officers tried to revive the gunman before paramedics arrived, Richardson said.   The suspect was pronounced dead at a hospital. His name wasn’t immediately released.

Widmer recently published a book with Simon & Schuster called “ Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington ” where he goes into detail about an extremely important train ride Lincoln took before he became president.   “I feel like I got lucky. We pick these history topics and sometimes they’re fun and sometimes they’re not. I knew I wanted to do a Lincoln book and as I’ve gotten older, I read much more deeply into his speeches,” said Widmer in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “I found them beautiful and I wanted to do a book on Lincoln as a writer and speaker and where this incredible language comes from. I also like trains and I like Amtrak and I thought Lincoln moving on a train was an unusual situation. We think of him as frozen in place in a photograph or a sculpture and here he’s really moving along from one city to another.”   During his trip, Lincoln stopped and spoke in places like Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. The country was incredibly divided at this point and Widmer wanted to depict what kind of country Lincoln was getting ready to take over as president.   “Each city was divided, just like the country was divided,” said Widmer. “If I succeeded in bringing out some of the tension of this fascinating man moving through America, at a time when it’s deeply divided and he’s succeeding at all odds in uniting it, then I think I’ve done a pretty good job. All of these things were happening and it felt like a movie. He’s getting in deeper and deeper trouble in some ways and he’s hearing more and more information that there is a huge plot to kill him as he’s coming through Baltimore.”   Widmer hopes his book can shed more light on the man that Lincoln before and during his presidency.   “He’s under the most pressure as a writer as he’s trying to survive and make it 24 hours into Washington to become the president,” said Widmer. “I just wanted to build up the pressure and show him getting through.

They are in Bel Air, Columbia, Glen Burnie, Owings Mills, Prince Frederick, Waldorf and White Oak.   “The acquisition of test kits from South Korea is already helping to expand our testing capacity across the state,” said Governor Hogan. “Continuing to expand our testing capabilities even further in high-priority areas, including these drive-thru sites, is an essential part of our recovery plan.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ   LIST: Maryland Coronavirus Testing Sites: Drive-Thrus, Triage Tents & More     Tests will be offered on an appointment-only basis to Maryland residents who are symptomatic and at high risk for complications from COVID-19, the Hogan administration said in a press release.   Anyone who wants to be tested must have a health care provider and an appointment.   They must first call a physician, who will assist patients in ordering and scheduling a test online using CRISP, the state’s health information exchange, with an exception of the site in Bel Air- which requires physicians to schedule appointments through a telephone hotline.   Patients cannot schedule or order tests by themselves.   At each test site, patients must remain in their vehicles with the windows rolled up until it’s time to receive their test. The testing requires a clinician to insert a swab into the back of the person’s nostril for several seconds.   Tested individuals will get information with further instructions at the test site and should continue to self-isolate at home while waiting for results, which should come within approximately two to five days, Hogan’s administration said.

(WJZ) —  A Maryland university is helping Facebook collect data for a real-time map that shows the prevalence of self-reported coronavirus symptoms around the country.  Facebook released its first round of data one week ago. It was based on surveys they invited their users to participate in. Shown in county-by-county maps, the data is meant to help officials allocate resources, better understand how the disease is spread and which communities can eventually reopen.   The U.S. map was developed by Carnegie Mellon who worked with Facebook to launch the survey in early April.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Now, the survey is launching worldwide and researchers, including the University of Maryland’s Frauke Kroiter, is helping to develop it.   “The goal is to create the questions so that everyone understands and can report,” Kroiter told WJZ.   It’s her job to help the survey get to every country in the right languages and in the right regions.   But without Facebook, she said, it just wouldn’t have the same reach.   Working with Facebook is a fantastic opportunity,” Kroiter added.   The survey invites Facebook users to share if they have symptoms like fevers, coughing or shortness of breath and loss of smell; all symptoms of COVID-19.   “These self-reports, how people feel, can be very important to know what’s going to happen,” Kroiter said.   In a post on April 20, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Founder of Facebook, wrote:   Facebook is uniquely suited to run these surveys because we serve a global community of billions of people and can do statistically accurate sampling. We do this in a privacy protective way where only the researchers at Carnegie Mellon see individual survey responses.   The survey and the data that comes from it can provide an early indicator of where the outbreak is growing and where the curve is flattening.

The program is a collaboration between the Salvation Army, the Ravens, the Orioles, Rouge Catering and dozens of volunteers.   Monday morning, those volunteers unloaded boxed cold lunches and microwaveable meals from a large Rouge Catering truck. They were then loaded into limousines from RMA Limo, the company that operates the Charm City Circulator.   The suited drivers will carry the volunteers to the homes of vulnerable seniors living in one of the city’s 145 senior living facilities and residential housing units.   “I’ve heard stories where people are eating cereal and mac-and-cheese, so we’re providing them a wholesome healthy meal,” Celeste Bendetti from Rouge Catering said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Every precaution is being taken in this enormous undertaking to protect the health of the volunteers, the drivers and the seniors. Meal recipients won’t be invited outside to collect the meals and volunteers won’t go door-to-door.   “The department of aging said, ‘We have this tremendous need. We can’t fill it.’ And the Salvation Army, as it does, said we can step in and help,” Major Gene Hogg, the commander of the Salvation Army of Maryland, said.   The Maryland Department of Transporation also got on board and the Orioles and Ravens sent out emails asking for volunteers.   On the program’s first day, organizers and volunteers were able to distribute 7,000 meals. In the coming weeks, they hope to reach 10,000 lunches and dinners prepared seven days per week to homebound, often isolated, sometimes lonely seniors.   “Being able to partner with these types of agencies and being able to reach them with this type of hope is pretty incredible for us, and we just thank God that we’re able to do it,” Hogg said.   The Salvation Army is prepared to provide the meals daily through August. Vulnerable seniors in need can call them at 410-396-2273 or visit  sa-md.org .

(WJZ) —  Three Carroll County men are charged with murder after police found the body of a Taneytown man set on fire in West Virginia, the Jefferson County, West Virginia Sheriff’s Office reports.  John Black III, Monroe Merrell and David Sanford, Jr., are all charged in the death of 33-year-old Jonathan Riddle.   FBI Searching For Missing Maryland Mother Heather Grogg And Teen Danielle Tyler; Disappearance May Have Ties To Jonathan Riddle’s Murder   According to the sheriff’s office, Riddle’s body was found burning near the woods in an extremely rural area of Rippon, West Virginia, by a passerby around 7:35 a.m. on the morning of March 18. Rippon is about 30 miles southwest of Frederick.   Three suspects arrested in the murder of Jonathan Riddle.   Police believe that Riddle was alive when he was taken to the rural area. A medical examiner determined Riddle died from multiple stab wounds and blows to the head, court documents show. A large pool of blood was found in the roadway, with a trail of blood leading to the body. However, no vehicles or cell phones were found in the area.   A Jefferson County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Holz learned a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with Maryland plates 9BY0804 may be linked to the crime. That car was later located outside a Westminster home. Sgt. Holz spoke with 22-year-old Merrell at the residence when the car was being seized. According to the charging documents, Merrell seemed nervous and Holz saw a small cut on his right hand.   Police found a bloodstain on the passenger door.   According to court documents, Riddle went to Sanford’s apartment on March 17 to allegedly meet Heather Grogg who was staying there.   It was there the victim reportedly got into an argument with Merrell. Police learned Riddle was stabbed twice inside the home by Sanford before his hands and feet were bound. Riddle was then taken to West Virginia, where he was allegedly stabbed again and set on fire.   An informant told police that both Merrell and Sanford allegedly stabbed the victim multiple times.   Sanford was charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping on April 9. Merrell was arrested in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He has not waived extradition and we are advised that his next court date is scheduled for May 18th.   That same informant told police Black was there and helped take Riddle to West Virginia where he too allegedly stabbed the victim. He was also charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping. Black was arrested on April 15 in Taneytown, Maryland.   On April 24, the sheriff’s office arrested a fourth person, Emily Rose Day, in Westminster. Day is being charged as an accessory before and after the fact in Riddle’s murder. She is currently being held in Maryland awaiting a court appearance to determine if she will waive extradition to West Virginia .   The FBI and Maryland State Police are trying to find two missing women they believe have ties to Sanford and Merrell. Eighteen-year-old Danielle Tyler and 33-year-old Heather Grogg could be traveling together and are “in danger.” They were last seen in Carroll County on April 6.   Tyler is 5-foot-3 and 110 pounds with blonde hair and green eyes. She has snake bite piercings on either side of her lower lip and a small nose ring in both sides of her nose.   Grogg is 5-foot-2 and 175 pounds with red or blonde hair with blue eyes. She has a lip piercing below her lower right lip.   Riddle is survived by his wife Diana, his stepchildren and parents.   “This investigation is not over and the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in coordination with other law enforcement agencies continues to follow leads in this case,” said Jefferson County Sheriff Pete Dougherty.

The option is available to select students in the entry-into-practice Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Clinical Nurse Leader master’s option who are scheduled to graduate on May 14 from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.   Gov. Larry Hogan’s public health surge plan is calling for adding up to 6,000 hospital beds across the state and included  reopening Laurel Hospital  and a field hospital an alternate care site  at the Baltimore Convention Center.   UMSON has 98 BSN and 53 CNL students qualified to request for an early exit.   “We are very pleased to partner with key Maryland health care systems to support them in meeting their needs for nursing personnel during this incredibly critical time,” said Dean Jane Kirschling, PhD, RN, FAAN. “The UMSON students opting into our early-exit option are well prepared and fully equipped to make a major contribution through their service as nursing graduates. I salute those students eligible and willing to serve under this unique initiative. And, I applaud all of our students for their dedication and resiliency during this tumultuous time, whether they are persevering in continuing their educational studies under difficult circumstances or are preparing to graduate and serve our larger community.”   To be eligible, students must meet a specific GPA and academic program requirements.   UMSON will give students a letter to give to prospective employers saying they have met all program requirements and have qualified for and taken the early-exit option.     One of those nurses is Debbie Sahlin- she wanted to become a nurse because of her own sons fight after a TBI at a young age. She hopes she can bring care and compassion to families affected by  #COVID19   @wjz   pic.twitter.com/O2pKsq4rdo   — Rachael Cardin (@RachaelCardin)  April 27, 2020     One of the students taking part is Debbie Sahlin. While she officially graduates in mid-May, on Monday she was hard at work at a newly-opened field hospital caring for patients recovering from COVID-19.   “For all of us, this is just not something we ever expected doing,” she said.   Despite that, Sahlin said she’s ready to begin helping others.   “I’m trained — I have to do it,” she said, “and second, I didn’t go to school to help healthy people, right? Don’t you go to school to become a health care professional because people you serve are sick?”   In total, 107 graduate nurses are taking part in the early workforce entry program.   Amid the global pandemic, their help is greatly needed, Dr. Maeve Howett, the associate dean for the nursing school, said.   “We need them. There is a shortage of nurses nationally and hopefully this just empowers them to feel as though the work they’re doing is terribly important,” Howett said.   Virtual training won’t compare to the hands-on experiences the soon-to-be graduates will get.   Sahlin knows more than most about hospital stays and fighting through hardship; her son suffered a traumatic brain injury as an infant and has been in a wheelchair ever since.   She said she wants to be a nurse known for her compassion.   As of Monday morning, Maryland currently has more than 19,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 850 people have died from the virus.

(AP) —  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday he is open to the idea of opening businesses in southwest Virginia before the rest of the state as he weighs when coronavirus restrictions can be lifted.  Northam said at a press conference that the situation in the border city of Bristol illustrates why a regional approach might be necessary.   Bristol, a city that sits on both sides of the Virginia-Tennessee border, now faces a situation where restaurants on the Tennessee side of the border can provide dine-in services to patrons, while those on the Virginia side cannot.   Last week, Northam had downplayed the idea of opening businesses on a regional basis. On Monday, he said wanted to discuss the idea further with the business community.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “To try to be consistent, is it really fair for Tennessee’s businesses to be open and Virginia’s not to be?” Northam asked. “I’m open-minded to all of that. I would say, ‘Stay tuned.’”   Northam faced increasingly skeptical questions at Monday’s press conference about his justification for continuing his executive orders closing nonessential businesses and requiring Virginians to stay at home, particularly as other Southern states are beginning to ease restrictions.   Northam said he’s trying to be guided by the science, but he acknowledged Monday that the science is in a state of flux. One computer model, for instance, suggests that Virginia may have reached its peak of COVID-19 cases. Another model, prepared by the University of Virginia, suggests that keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place through the duration of Northam’s current order of June 10 will only delay an inevitable surge of cases, and result in a sharp peak of cases in August.   “It’s not a perfect science and I would be the first as a scientist to agree with that,” said Northam, a physician. “They call this a novel COVID-19, novel meaning new to the world. So there a lot of things that we don’t know about the virus that we’d like to know.”   Also Monday, Northam said he worked with the governors in Maryland and Delaware to request federal help to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19 cases connected to poultry plants on the Delmarva peninsula. He said workers from the federal Centers for Disease Control arrived in Virginia on Monday. Teams include epidemiologists, contact trace workers and translators who speak Haitian Creole, a language commonly used among the region’s poultry workers.   “The poultry economy on the Delmarva peninsula is so interconnected that a coordinated approach is critical,” Northam said.   For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. The vast majority of people recover.

Council members also approved emergency legislation providing $3 million for distance learning for city students and additional funding for the city’s plan to reduce food insecurity.   As part of a public-private partnership, the city established a $5.5 million fund specifically for small businesses.   City councilman Leon Pinkett said he wants to make sure that local and minority-owned businesses specifically are supported during the pandemic.   “We know that oftentimes with emergency spending, local and minority businesses are left out. We just want to make certain that all of our businesses are included,” he said.   As of Monday, there are 1,933 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city.   The council also named Friday “Charm City Cheer Day.” They’re encouraging people to safely cheer on frontline workers at 7 p.m. from the comfort of their homes.

Animal rescues across the country have seen a spike in adoptions and foster applications since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Maryland SPCA.   “All of our pets right now are currently in foster care with amazing parents so they are all taken care of,” said Katie Flory, the community relations director for the Maryland SPCA.   While many turn to their furry friends during the pandemic for comfort, for some, it has become increasingly difficult in the wake of social distancing restrictions to continue caring for their pets.   “It puts people in a very scary situation where they feel like they’re not going to be able to feed their cats and dogs,” Maryland SPCA volunteer Melissa Welsh said.   As a response, the Maryland SPCA launched a new program called “Kibble Connection Food Pantry” catered to those who have lost their jobs and are struggling to feed themselves or their families.

Through the pet food pantry program, people can fill out a form on the Maryland SPCA website and schedule a time to pick up cat or dog food.   Organizers said it’s crucial to ensure animals get the nutrition they need so they can continue to provide their unconditional love in their forever homes.   “Pets are part of our family and we as a shelter, our mission is to improve the lives of pets and people,” said Flory.

Voters in the 7th congressional district will be voting primarily by mail to replace the late Rep. Elijah Cummings in the House of Representatives.   Nikki Charlson of the Maryland State Board of Elections said they prefer voters mail in their ballots but they understand not everyone will be able to do so.   “Our strong recommendation is to use the mail-in ballot since it is the best way to keep people healthy,” Charlson said.   Across the entire district, which includes parts of Baltimore and Howard counties as well as Baltimore City, there will be just three open polling places:     Edmondson High School, 501 North Athol Avenue, Baltimore;   Martin’s West, 6817 Dogwood Road, Windsor Mill; and   The Howard County Fairgrounds, 2210 Fairgrounds Road, West Friendship.     Voters will be able to register to vote in person if they need to.   Mail-in balloting isn’t new, but the scale of the election requires some big adjustments. Paper ballots have gone out and they need to be postmarked by Tuesday. No stamp is needed.   In the primary election, voters chose Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik to face off to fill the remainder of Cummings’ term.

The Ravens, however, show no signs of slowing down.   After a whirlwind of free agent signings and the NFL draft, the AFC North has a decidedly different look:     Cincinnati has essentially handed the reins of the offense to LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, the top pick in the draft.   Ben Roethlisberger is poised to return to the Steelers after missing the final 14 games in 2019.   Cleveland is counting on a new general manager, a first-year coach and an improved offensive line to rescue the long suffering franchise.     The chase is on, but Baltimore might be tougher to take down than Jackson in an open field.   The Ravens didn’t stand pat after a 14-2 season in which they easily won the AFC North over a trio of sputtering pursuers that failed to achieve a winning record.   “We got better as a football team,” general manager Eric DeCosta declared after a draft in which the Ravens snagged 10 players, most notably LSU linebacker Patrick Queen and Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins.   Dobbins joins an offense that led the league in scoring and set an NFL record with 3,296 yards rushing. In his first full season as a starter, Jackson ran for 1,206 yards — most ever by a quarterback — and threw 36 touchdown passes before being selected NFL MVP by a unanimous vote.   LOOKING FOR MORE   DeCosta improved Baltimore’s defensive front by obtaining Calais Campbell in a trade with Jacksonville and signing free agent Derek Wolfe.   Queen and third-round pick Malik Harrison are poised to fill the void at middle linebacker and the secondary returns Pro Bowl selections Earl Thomas, Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphrey.   READ MORE: Viviano: Ravens’ 2020 NFL Draft Class ‘Packed With Potential’   The offense lost eight-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda to retirement, but DeCosta drafted a pair of linemen as potential replacements.   COUNTING ON JOE   A two-win Bengals team used the offseason to make a clean break heading into coach Zac Taylor’s second year, tearing up the foundation.   They made Burrow the new face of the franchise as Andy Dalton’s replacement. They also took receiver Tee Higgins, who grew up modeling his game after Cincinnati’s A.J. Green and is now in line to replace him down the line.   The Bengals scored the third-fewest points in the NFL last season and ought to at least be more interesting in Burrow’s first go-around.   Cincinnati fortified the defense through free agency, bringing in three cornerbacks, a safety, a linebacker and a tackle.   WELCOME BACK, BIG BEN   The Steelers’ biggest offseason move centered not on the draft or free agency but the continued rehab of Roethlisberger’s right elbow.   The team is betting heavily that the 38-year-old Roethlisberger can return to form in 2020, and they tried to help him along by grabbing a couple of big targets to punch up an offense that sputtered in his absence.   Notre Dame wide receiver Chase Claypool (6-foot-4) is the cornerstone of the draft class and tight end Eric Ebron (also 6-4) signed a two-year deal looking for a chance to get his career back on track following an injury-marred 2019 in Indianapolis.   Pittsburgh also signed outside linebacker Bud Dupree to a one-year franchise tender with the hopes of keeping him long term. Dupree and All-Pro T.J. Watt formed one of the league’s top pass-rush tandems last season. They’ll need to do it again if the Steelers have any chance of keeping up in a division featuring three Heisman Trophy quarterbacks, all 25 or younger.   TRY, TRY AGAIN   Like last year, the Browns seem to be winning the offseason. That doesn’t guarantee there will be a winning carryover.   First-time general manager Andrew Berry stuffed some major holes in Cleveland’s roster with free agent signings and astute draft picks. The erratic, inconsistent play at both tackle spots was a major issue last season, in part leading to a drop-off in the play of second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield.   Free agent RT Jack Conklin was signed to a three-year, $42 million contract, and the Browns grabbed Alabama standout Jedrick Wills with the No. 10 overall pick to play on the left side. The hope is the newcomers will protect Mayfield, open holes for running back Nick Chubb and give first-year coach Kevin Stefanski’s offense a chance to flourish.   The secondary could be special if LSU safety Grant Delpit can step in right away. The loss of veteran linebackers Joe Schobert and Christian Kirksey has left a vacuum, but the Browns added depth up front in free agent tackle Andrew Billings and end Adrian Clayborn.   The coronavirus pandemic has delayed Stefanski from seeing what he’s got on the field, and the interruption could be costly for a young team still trying to find its way.   ____   AP Sports Writers Joe Kay in Cincinnati, Will Graves in Pittsburgh and Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed.

(AP) —  Eric DeCosta wanted to make Baltimore’s impressive offense even better. “Undefendable,” the general manager said.   Then he went to work in the NFL draft.   Over the course of three days, DeCosta added several key pieces to a unit that led the league in scoring and rushing yardage last season.   Baltimore snagged Ohio State star running back J.K. Dobbins, wide receivers Devin Duvernay of Texas and James Proche of SMU (who can also return punts) and a pair of offensive linemen who hope to ease the sting of eight-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda’s retirement in March.   DeCosta didn’t ignore the defense. He secured LSU linebacker Patrick Queen in the first round and Ohio State linebacker Malik Harrison with the 98th overall pick. Either or both could fill the hole in the middle of the defense.   The Ravens also drafted a pair of defensive tackles, an extension of DeCosta’s mission this offseason to improve Baltimore’s run defense.   “We always want to be as strong as we can be on the offensive and defensive lines,” DeCosta said. “It’s important to us to control the line of scrimmage and be a physical football team.”   And finally, after making a trade that enabled him to get Proche in the sixth round, DeCosta selected Iowa safety Geno Stone with the 219th pick and Baltimore’s 10th overall.   HOLD THAT LINE   Dobbins and Duvernay are playmakers, but coach John Harbaugh was just as pleased about getting some extra blocking in front of slick-footed quarterback Lamar Jackson. Before the draft, the coach said, “We’ve got to make sure that we do a great job of making sure the interior offensive line is all set.”   Third-round pick Tyre Phillips of Mississippi State is a 6-foot-5, 331-pound tackle who could easily make the shift to guard, much like Jonathan Ogden did as a rookie in 1996. Ogden, of course, ultimately became a Hall of Fame left tackle.   Drafted Saturday in the fourth round, Ben Bredeson played guard at Michigan under Harbaugh’s brother Jim, and has the ability to play center.   STOP THE RUN   The Ravens allowed 4.4 yards per carry last season before Derrick Henry ran for 195 yards for Tennessee in Baltimore’s playoff defeat.   In an effort to improve that shortcoming, DeCosta got Calais Campbell in a trade with Jacksonville and signed free agent Derek Wolfe before continuing the process in the draft.   Justin Madubuike, a third-round pick from Texas A&M, will likely get plenty of playing time. The Ravens are looking for the same from fifth-round selection Broderick Washington Jr. of Texas Tech.   DEPTH AT RB   The Ravens did well utilizing the running back tandem of Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill last year. So why nab Dobbins in the second round?   Because he was there.   “We didn’t anticipate it. We just had to take him,” DeCosta said. “He’s just a talented guy and it made too much sense to take him.”   Dobbins ran for an Ohio State-record 2,003 yards in 2019.   LACKING THE EDGE   The Ravens emerge from the draft still looking for a strong pass rusher off the edge.   “You’re always going to have a hole that stays open,” DeCosta said. “We’ll continue to try to fill those holes.”   Madubuike has the potential to help.   “He did have sacks (5 1/2 in each of the past two years),” Harbaugh noted. “He had tons of pressures and tons of quarterback hits. He chased quarterbacks down and stuff like that.”   VIRTUALLY PERFECT   Harbaugh was delighted with the technical aspect of the NFL’s first virtual draft.   “I thought it went great. I give our IT guys all the credit in the world,” he said. “It was perfect.”   DeCosta felt that preparing for a draft without any visits from players, Pro Days or 1-on-1 interviews was a refreshing change.   “It was like an old-school, throwback draft,” DeCosta said. “Sometimes you can get so much information that you over-analyze a little bit. So from that standpoint it was really easy to get prepared for this draft because we just sat in front of our machines and watched as much tape as we could. There’s kind of a beauty to that whole process.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Baltimore selected linebacker Patrick Queen out of Louisiana State University 28th overall. It was a position that the team desperately needed to fill with the departure of Patrick Onwuasor and Josh Bynes this offseason.   Queen joins an already stout Ravens defense after three seasons at LSU in which he helped the Tigers win a national championship.   Ravens Take LB Patrick Queen With 28th Overall Pick In 2020 NFL Draft   Now, with the retirement of guard Marshal Yanda and a knee injury to center Matt Skura, the Ravens could likely shift their focus to interior offensive line help as the draft progresses over the next two days.   Baltimore has two picks in the second round and two picks in the third round which gives the team plenty of opportunity to fill its need at the interior offensive line position.   The question now is, who are the top offensive lineman remaining in the draft that the Ravens could take over the course of the next two rounds?   Baltimore has the 23rd and 28th pick in the second round and the 28th and 42nd pick in the third round, respectively.   Robert Hunt ranks No. 1 on ESPN’s list of remaining offensive guards. The 6’5″ 323 lbs. lineman was a four year starter a Louisiana and would be a great successor to Yanda.   Unfortunately for the Ravens, there’s a good chance Hunt will be off the board by the time they select in the second round. That is, of course, unless they trade up.   General Manager Eric DeCosta mentioned in a virtual press conference this week that the team is no stranger to making trades in the draft.   “We love to make trades,” DeCosta said. “We’ve made a lot the last three years. We made a ton of trades, and it’s been really fun for us. I think we’ve benefitted from some of the trades we made. This year we do have a lot of trades. We have the opportunity to go up and get a guy.”   If the team does not trade up, there’s still plenty of options for the Ravens to fill their need on the interior offensive line.   John Simpson, Tremayne Anchrum and Gage Cervenka, all guards from Clemson, would be a good fit for the Ravens. Georgia guard Solomon Kindley and Michigan State guard Tyler Higby could also still be on the board by the time the Ravens pick.   If there’s one thing that Baltimore fans know, however, it’s that the team’s front office is not afraid to pick the best player still on the board no matter what position they play.

(AP) —  A Tulane University basketball player who recently declared for the NBA draft is charged with murder and other counts in a Georgia slaying.   Teshaun Hightower, who led the Green Wave in scoring last season, was booked into jail Saturday on multiple charges, including murder and aggravated assault, Henry County Jail records show.   Prior to college, Hightower attended Mt. Zion Prep near Baltimore.   He was one of six people wanted in connection with an April 8 homicide in Stockbridge, Georgia, Henry County police said in a Facebook post Friday. Police spokesman Capt. Randy Lee told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the victim, Devante Anthony Long, died from gunshot wounds after he was taken to a hospital.   Jail records show that five of the six men are now in police custody, including Hightower’s brother, Jeffrey Hightower.   On the day of the shooting, Teshaun Hightower posted a tweet that said “God protect my people.”   Tulane “immediately dismissed” Hightower from the basketball program after learning about his arrest, athletic director Troy Dannen said in a statement.   Hightower, 22, said he was entering the NBA draft pool on April 18, just 10 days after Long’s death. In his announcement on Twitter, the junior guard noted he planned to maintain the option of returning to school with a year of eligibility left.   The 6-foot-5 Hightower, a native of Lithonia, Georgia, averaged 15.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game during the 2019-20 season, his only one at Tulane. He played the previous two seasons at Georgia before transferring.   It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. Jail records show he was scheduled to appear in court on Sunday.   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

And so, there’s a theory that we can actually take the antibodies that person has developed and transfuse them into a patient who is acutely ill, and that may help the acutely ill patient recover more quickly,” says Matthew Poffenroth, M.D., chief clinical officer at LifeBridge Health, Physician Enterprise.   Blood donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19 is used to make antibody-rich convalescent plasma. Prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from China suggest that convalescent plasma can potentially lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.   LifeBridge Health is partnering with the Blood Bank of Delmarva and the American Red Cross to coordinate plasma donations in accordance with FDA-approved protocols. To donate, you must be symptom-free for 14 days and show a negative result from a second COVID-19 test or be symptom-free for 28 days (in which case you would not need to take a second COVID-19 test).   Those who are eligible can donate through the Blood Bank of Delmarva’s or American Red Cross’ convalescent plasma programs. The donation process takes approximately 1.5 hours to complete and is simple. Donors are often able to relax and watch a movie during the process.   While there is still a lot to be learned about convalescent plasma, there is hope that this therapy can potentially save lives.

During her first year, she faced tuition and expenses that ran nearly $50,000, even after a scholarship. So she decided to check out a dating website that connected women looking for financial help with men willing to provide it, in exchange for companionship and sex — a “sugar daddy” relationship as they are known.   Now, almost three years and several sugar daddies later, Candice is set to graduate from college free and clear, while some of her peers are burdened with six-digit debts.   As the cost of tuition and rent rises, so does the apparent popularity of such sites among students. But are they really providing financial relief, or signing women up for something more exploitative and dangerous than debt?   Candice believes such sites are a “great resource” for young women, but others say these arrangements smack of prostitution and take advantage of women in a vulnerable situation.   Lynn Comella, an associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada Las Vegas, said that it is not unusual for students to turn to sex work such as stripping, prostitution or webcam work to pay for school. But the sugar daddy sites are relatively new, and she says not entirely upfront about what they are really about.   These arrangements are more vague than prostitution– there is an expectation of material benefit but it is not always specified and sex is not guaranteed.   Ron Weitzer, a professor of sociology at George Washington University and criminologist with an expertise in the sex industry describes it as “prostitution light.”   “Sugar Daddy” arrangements have existed for ages, and it’s unclear if they are becoming more common because the phenomenon is not well studied. But experts say at the very least the internet has made these transactions far easier to arrange and negotiate. “It allows you to hone in on what you want,” said Kevin Lewis, an assistant professor of sociology at University of California San Diego who studies online dating. “You could argue it is just making the market more efficient.”   Candice says she sifted through many potential suitors before finding one she clicked with. She says she considers her sugar daddy one of her best friends and that they care deeply for each other.   “The people who have a stigma, or associate a negative connotation with it, don’t understand how it works,” she says.   But unlike most relationships, she is paid a sizeable monthly allowance that helps her pay for school.   U.S. undergraduate students last year finished school with an average of $35,000 in student debt — a figure that has risen steadily every year, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert. The average graduate debt load is $75,000, and some longer programs force students into much deeper debt.   Many students say their loans don’t cover the cost of living, and with rent skyrocketing in most major cities, they are left scrambling to make up the difference.   One graduate student at Columbia University in New York had a scholarship that covered almost all of her tuition, but not her living expenses. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the potential impact on her job prospects. She tried to make do — sharing a room with a classmate and working a minimum wage job, plus any freelance work she could get. But still she struggled to pay her rent and utilities, and her grades suffered.   “That’s just not why I am here,” she said. “I wanted to find the most amount of money I could make for the least amount of effort.”   So she found herself surfing Craigslist and Backpage.com and later, SeekingArrangement.com, the largest of the sugar daddy websites. Now she has two sugar daddies, one she sees occasionally and another who is more like a conventional boyfriend, except that he pays her a monthly allowance and helps rent her an apartment closer to him.   SeekingArrangement.com said it is most popular in Los Angeles and New York. The average rent in both areas is well over $2,000 a month, according to Zillow research.   The Columbia student says she plans to continue “sugaring” after she graduates to buy herself time to find a more traditional job and remain officially unemployed so she can defer repaying the roughly $70,000 in loans she had already racked up.   “There is a lot of moral panic about it,” she said. “But what are the real estate and academic funding situations that led to this?”   Brandon Wade, creator of the site, touts it as an “alternative to financial aid” but says the company did not set out to target students when it launched in 2006. It stumbled on this niche and began in 2011 offering students a free premium membership, which usually costs $30 a month. It charges sugar daddies $70 to $180 a month, depending on the membership level.   Seekingarrangement.com also offers to connect same-sex couples looking for such arrangements, or “sugar mommies” for men. But the male-female “sugar daddy” dynamic makes up the bulk of its business.   It’s difficult to pin down exactly how many students are involved in such situations, because they are private transactions. And it’s a niche rarely studied by academics.   SeekingArrangement.com says student users on the site jumped from 79,400 worldwide in 2010 to 1.9 million this year and students make up one-third of its users. And while it sees thousands of signups on any given day, the company says enrollment jumps during August and January when tuition is typically due, sometimes to more than double its normal levels.   Women who have used the site report experiences that run the gamut — from respectful chaste dates all the way to aggressive solicitation online, even though it is forbidden on the site.  Sex is not guaranteed although most users say it is implied. The company says a few arrangements have even led to marriage, although it is rare.   Some of the women say they feel respected and cared for, but remain aware that it is an arrangement, not traditional romantic love.   “It benefits me in many ways — we have a healthy relationship, we travel together, I’m able to enjoy the city more,” said the New York graduate student.   Still, she said, it is a job.   “It does kind of rub me the wrong way that some people don’t see it as sex work,” she said.   Comella warns that unlike sex workers, many women doing this put their true identities online, and that could put them at risk. While Seeking Arrangement runs background checks, there have been reports of violence against both men and women stemming from sugar daddy websites.   Kristen Houser of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center says that violence is common any time money is exchanged for sex. “You need to pay attention that there is a power imbalance,” she said.   Wade says there are risks inherent in any dating website. He should know; he runs several, including one that allows users to bid on dates and another focused on open relationships. He said he created SeekingArrangement.com out of his own frustration with women. An MIT graduate, he had difficulty meeting women and realized a site such as this would highlight what set him apart — money.   “Money and sex are things that people want,” he said. “I think the controversy comes into play on seeking arrangement because we are so upfront about it.”   (Copyright 2016 by The Associated Press.

The site’s methodology included three different scores for each state that were dependent upon thirteen other variables to determine which states were the most and least difficult to self isolate in. The three categories are Social Environment, Time Spent on Social Activities and Money Spent on Social Activities and they were based on “ranges from whether residents have supportive relationships to how non-essential travel has changed due to the pandemic and how much consumers spent on social activities before COVID-19.”     Social distancing is an important but stressful way to stop the spread of  #coronavirus .

On Sunday the Pediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) warned about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children, some who had tested positive for Covid-19, presenting “overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters.”   In a statement sent over the weekend to medical professionals who look after critically ill children, PICS said “abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation.”   So what is Kawasaki disease and how worried should parents and carers be?   What is Kawasaki disease?   Kawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed.   According to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), the condition — also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome — mainly affects children under the age of 5, although it can affect children of any age.   Symptoms include a high temperature lasting for five days or longer, alongside a rash, swollen glands in the neck, dry cracked lips, red fingers or toes and red eyes, according to the healthcare provider.   If treated, the symptoms usually become less severe, the NHS said, adding that the disease is not contagious.   “Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,” Professor Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.   A condition that can lead to heart complications   Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, and serious complications can include aneurysms and coronary artery dilations, according to US healthcare company the Mayo Clinic.   Standard treatment, which involves intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, can substantially decrease the development of coronary artery abnormalities, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.   According to the NHS, around 25% of children with the disease who do not receive treatment go on to experience heart complications, which can include conditions such as heart attacks and heart disease.   However, the health care provider says that most children with Kawasaki disease make a full recovery if they receive prompt treatment.   What causes Kawasaki disease?   Experts admit that the causes of Kawasaki disease are not fully understood, but think that children who develop it could be genetically predisposed to it, having inherited certain genes from their parents.   The disease itself is not contagious, according to the NHS, meaning that it is unlikely to be caused by a virus alone.   The disease is more common in children from Northeast Asia, especially Japan and Korea, the NHS said.   What is the link to Covid-19?   The link between Kawasaki disease and Covid-19 is unclear, but health care professionals have reassured parents that the risk of children becoming severely ill with the virus remains low.   In a report released in April, the CDC said that children diagnosed with coronavirus in the US typically have  mild cases of the virus.   The number of Covid-19 cases among children remains small and while some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date, according to the CDC.   Professor Rosalind Smyth, director and professor of child health, UCL Great Ormond St Institute of Child Health, said current evidence suggests that most children with Covid-19 who receive medical attention have mild symptoms, with about half having a fever, around 40% having a cough and less than 10% of reported cases having gastrointestinal symptoms.   “However, our understanding of this condition in children is limited. Covid-19 does present, in adults, as an inflammatory disease affecting a number of organs. We should investigate fully these children, with SARS-CoV-2, who present with a multi-system inflammatory disease to assess whether this is a presentation of Covid-19,” Smyth said in a statement Monday.

Lynchburg Circuit Court Judge F. Patrick Yeatts granted a temporary injunction on Monday for SafeSide Tactical, allowing its Lynchburg range to be open for business effective immediately.   The judge’s ruling comes as gun rights advocates in the state are fighting to reopen indoor gun ranges, which have been closed since March by Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat.  Protesters  across the country, including in Virginia, have also called for America to reopen its economy, as the  unemployment rate has climbed to a historic high  and businesses are taking a huge hit.   To slow the spread of coronavirus, Northam issued an  executive order  on March 23 closing “recreational and entertainment businesses,” including theaters, salons and indoor shooting ranges. Firearms retailers were allowed to remain open so long as they limit “all in-person shopping to no more than 10 patrons.” Northam recently  extended his order  through May 8.   The day after Northam announced the extension, SafeSide Tactical, along with Virginia Citizens Defense League, Gun Owners of America and Association of Virginia Gun Ranges, sued the governor, arguing that Northam’s order exceeded his executive authority and violated the Virginia state constitution.   On Monday, Yeatts wrote in his opinion that while Northam is “given great deference” and power during an emergency, state law limits his authority over the right to keep and bear arms.   “The Court understands the Governor’s desire to protect the citizens of our great Commonwealth. But in taking steps to stop the spread of Covid-19, he took a step beyond what is allowed” by the state law, the judge wrote.   SafeSide’s co-owner Mitchell Taylor confirmed to CNN that the range, which has furloughed about half of its staff, will reopen Wednesday.   Taylor said SafeSide will require face coverings for all staff and customers. Sessions will be limited to half an hour and one shooter per lane. Since there are only nine lanes, Taylor said, there will only be nine patrons at the range at a time. Safety officers will disinfect the area between sessions.   Asked about the ruling Monday during a press conference, Northam said that the state will consider their options as they move forward.   “No particular business has been singled out,” Northam said. “But businesses where the patrons would be at risk to be confined and whether it would perhaps be more than 10 people, we made the decision to close them.”   “So while I respect the decisions of our judicial system, we will look at our options as we move forward,” he added.   The office of Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement that it will “analyze the decision and decide how best to proceed.”   Taylor told CNN that SafeSide’s legal team is looking at the best options to reopen its Roanoke location and waiting to see if the state appeals the circuit decision.   “We feel confidently we can operate the business in a manner that’s safe for our customers and our staff,” he said.

That means hundreds of local artists, stagehands, technicians and support staff have no work and little hope of work any time soon.   “Right now, it’s like the whole entire bottom dropped out of our industry. There’s been zero revenue,” said Ron Legler, the president of the 107-year-old Hippodrome Theatre.   Before the pandemic, the Hippodrome was set to have its best season yet.   Now, popular shows like “Dear Evan Hansen” have been interrupted and concerts and comedy shows have been postponed or canceled.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “It’s a shame … because we were in the golden age of touring Broadway,” Legler said. “I mean, “Hamilton” lifted all these boats.”   Last season, more than 300,000 people visited the Hippodrome, enjoying the best of Broadway. Now, in hard-hit New York City, 41 theaters on Broadway are closed through June 7, but that date could be extended to Labor Day or later.   “Even with September 11, as horrible as that was, Broadway only closed for two days,” Legler said.   So with the Hippodrome sitting empty, Legler and his staff decided to reach out to theatergoers and post behind-the-scenes tours of 310,000 square-feet of theatrical history.   Those tours are available on the Hippodrome’s Instagram and Facebook pages as well as  its website .     Until theaters can reopen, Legler has his fingers crossed that come November when “Hairspray” comes to town, lovers of the arts can see Tracy Turnblad’s adventures in Baltimore come to life on stage.   “This is going to take a long time to crawl out of,” he said.

Elijah Cummings in October last year.  Voters in Baltimore City, Howard and Baltimore counties heading into the final hours of casting ballots to fill the seat had a whole new experience.   Sanitizer was supplied to poll workers and voters alike. Cones outside showed boundaries and paint lines on the floor inside marked off the distance voters must leave between each other and the poll workers.   These were the restrictions for people choosing to vote in person following the guidelines of social distancing imposed since the outbreak of COVID-19.   Maryland’s 7th Congressional District Special Election Is Tuesday. Here’s What You Need To Know   “It’s very different but I’m glad that they’re keeping everybody safe,” said a woman voting in Baltimore at Edmondson High School in Baltimore.   Voters have the choice between Democrat Kweisi Mfume and Republican Kimberly Klacik.   A woman wears a mask while voting in-person at Edmonson High School in the special election to fill the congressional vacancy left by the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings.   For Henry Kinard, it was a  matter of principle to vote in person.   “People died for us to vote, and coming out made me feel better,” he said.   By early afternoon, 150 people had voted, but the city was prepared for greater numbers.   “I erred on the side of a high number because of the number of ballots that had been returned was very low, so this morning I really expected a line here and I did not have that,” said Armstead Jones, Baltimore Board of Elections administrator.   Voters have been strongly enforced to use the ballots mailed to them.   But those who did not come to the poll were glad to have it.   Alvin Wilson had no choice but to cast his ballot in person since he said he did not receive one in the mail.   “So I called the election board this morning, and they told me to come to this address and that’s what I did,” Wilson said.   Jones believes this single race election to fill the congressional seat is a good test for what’s to come in the June primary.   “This is a good test with the June 2 election statewide, presidential election, and many candidates this a good test and there’s some things I see now that I would do differently,” Jones said.   It is likely to be a few days before the votes are tallied.   Nikki Charlson of the Maryland State Board of Elections said they prefer voters mail in their ballots but they understand not everyone will be able to do so.   Across the entire district, which includes parts of Baltimore and Howard counties as well as Baltimore City, there will be just three open polling places:     Edmondson High School, 501 North Athol Avenue, Baltimore;   Martin’s West, 6817 Dogwood Road, Windsor Mill; and   The Howard County Fairgrounds, 2210 Fairgrounds Road, West Friendship.     “Our strong recommendation is to use the mail-in ballot since it is the best way to keep people healthy,” Charlson said.   Voters will be able to register to vote in person if they need to.   Mail-in balloting isn’t new, but the scale of the election requires some big adjustments. Paper ballots have gone out and they need to be postmarked by Tuesday. No stamp is needed.   Polls opened at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.   As of 6:20 p.m. Tuesday, more than 110,000 mail-in ballots have been received. A total of 830 people voted in-person, including 364 in Baltimore, 283 in Baltimore County and 183 in Howard County.   Click here  for the latest election results.

The constant battle can also take a toll on health care workers’ mental health: over the weekend, New York City emergency room doctor Lorna Breen died by suicide while visiting family in Charlottesville, Virginia,  CBS New York reports .   Breen told her father she was dealing with countless patients, some who were dying before even leaving an ambulance.

Soon, people as far as Vietnam were watching.   The camporee usually draws around 400 people, but with social distancing orders in place, their gathering wouldn’t be allowed.

Patients simply place an order, get their medical cannabis status verified, and then get a text to come pick it up at a drive-thru window without ever having to leave their car.   Medical marijuana growers, processors and dispensaries can all still operate because they’re considered essential health care businesses in Maryland.   “Cannabis is medicine.

Hogan on Friday is a common-sense approach to rebounding from the coronavirus pandemic, but the timeline and the ongoing restrictions on large-group gatherings, unfortunately, do not allow for us to hold proms.”   High school graduation ceremonies, which are set to begin May 29, have not yet been canceled. High school administrators are planning virtual senior awards nights and similar events to honor this year’s graduates.   “This is not a place we ever envisioned being when the school year started, but circumstances entirely out of our control have put us here,” Dr. Arlotto said. “We are determined to do everything we can to pay tribute to our amazing seniors in the best possible way we can given the circumstances.”   Dr. Arlotto said a decision on transforming graduation ceremonies to a virtual venue will be made in the near future.

Our internal clocks are shot. Tuesdays are Thursdays are Wednesdays are Sundays. There are no weekdays, or weekends. There is only yesterday, today and tomorrow.   Along with these feelings of disorientation, it may seem like it’s getting harder to concentrate and taking longer to complete tasks, as if our brains are just working more slowly.   If it feels like your brain is turning into mush, you’re not alone. Experts say it all has to do with how the pandemic is affecting our cognitive health — meaning, our ability to clearly think, learn and remember.   “It is a perfect storm between changes in environment, loss of social anchors and increases in cognitive stress,” said Elissa Epel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. “And then on top of that, most of us are not getting the quality sleep that we used to.”   Here’s what’s going on, and what we can do about it.   Our usual routines are gone   Much like our bodies depend on environmental cues like sunlight to regulate our circadian rhythms, they also rely on physical and social cues, explains Epel.   Those cues include routines like morning and evening commutes, set mealtimes or weekly religious services that help us keep track of what day it is.   For those confined to our homes, those routines have largely disappeared. Days have lost their usual structure, meaning once-clear boundaries are now blurred.   “We’ve lost all of the routine of a typical week, and that means having weekends as a boundary or as a separation or something to look forward to,” Epel said. “Now the weekend is the same as a weekday.”   Because work is home and home is work for many people, some may find themselves working longer hours or into the weekends. Gone are the happy hours, concerts or sporting events that once separated weekdays from weekends, causing the days to just drag on.   The loss of routine also means more mental energy is spent on determining what each day will consist of.   “When we had our routines, you don’t really think about that stuff,” said Lynn Bufka, associate executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association. “So while your commute may be tiring, there’s not a second dialogue in your head, trying to figure out what has to happen this day.”   For those who still need to go into work, routines may look a lot different. And there’s the added mental strain of remembering to socially distance, wear masks and avoid touching surfaces. All of that can contribute to a sense of disorientation.   We’re multitasking a lot more   Another reason we can’t keep track of the days?   We’re multitasking a lot more. Many people are finding themselves balancing multiple responsibilities, such as homeschooling children or caring for an elderly family member — all while holding down a full-time job or coping with the stress of a layoff.   Because all of those things are now happening in the same place, and often at the same time, we may find ourselves switching in between tasks more frequently. Or we’re overstimulated from using multiple screens or consuming news too many times a day. All of these things, Epel said, increase our cognitive load — in other words, they use up more of our mental resources.   “Our working memory is a limited resource,” Epel said. “We can easily tax it by trying to engage in too many activities at once or trying to multitask in our mind.”   That’s why you might find yourself struggling to recall basic information or perform the tasks you used to with the same efficiency.   “When (people are) attempting to multitask, it makes it more difficult to encode the information that’s in front of them,” said Inger Burnett-Zeigler, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University. “Then the information is not stored and they can’t remember what they were doing or what they were saying a moment or a few moments later on.”   Those disruptions are causing stress   Not being able to remember what day it is can also be a symptom of stress, explains Burnett-Zeigler.   The pandemic is becoming a source of chronic stress given that it’s been going on for weeks, or even months for some people, she said. High stress levels impair our concentration and attention, and can affect short-term memory.   Another effect of stress? It can worsen our quality of sleep.   “Often if you’re feeling stressed or you’re feeling anxious, those thoughts and feelings can show up and either make it more difficult to fall asleep or more difficult to stay asleep,” Burnett-Zeigler said.   That sleeplessness, in turn, can further cognitive impairment, attention and concentration issues and short-term memory loss, she said.   Then again, time is relative   So what can we do about all this?   The psychiatrists and psychologists we spoke to recommended trying to maintain a sense of structure, to the extent possible. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day is one strategy.   They also recommended taking frequent breaks, exercising, eating healthy and limiting news consumption.   And if it makes you feel better, no one knows what day it is anymore. Time is an illusion.   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(WJZ) —  Baltimore County is committing over $10 million in grants to protect jobs, small businesses and artists, County Executive Johnny Olszewski announced Tuesday.  The county is setting aside $10 million in new grant funding for small businesses and offering $100,000 in grants to assist professional artists, musicians and performers.   “Small businesses are a critical link of our county’s economy, and we must do all that we can to support them in meeting their basic needs during this crisis,” said County Executive Olszewski. “As we move toward economic recovery, these grants will provide a critical bridge to Baltimore County small businesses who have not received other forms of assistance.”   The Department of Economic and Workforce Development (DEWD) will administer the Baltimore County COVID-19 Small Business Relief Grants Program, which will award grants of up to $15,000 each to more than 650 Baltimore County-based small businesses on a first-come, first-served basis.   Additionally, the county is setting a goal to award at least 25 percent of grant funding to women and minority-owned businesses, they announced Tuesday.   The program, which is separate from the federal Paycheck Protection Program created as part of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, is welcome news to business owners like Chris Janoff at Stone Mill Bakery and Angela Tandy at Sassanova.   “We’re still opening, but for people not to be able to come and sit, (it’s) definitely a rude awakening,” Janoff said.   Tandy said while she has three stores across the state, her website only does a fraction of the business.   For now, since she never heard back from the federal government, she’s been forced to pay her employees out of her own bank account.   “I was one of the first to have my applications in and then I didn’t hear anything,” she said.   Grant applications will be accepted beginning May 11. To qualify, the businesses must retain at least half of the workforce they had before January 31, 2020, including two non-owner employees before the stay-at-home order.  They also must:      have at least two employees who are not owners or part-owners,   have no more than 25 employees per Baltimore County establishment,   demonstrate that they have lost at least 40 percent of their revenues since the Stay at Home order began,   have been in operation for at least one year as of January 1, 2020, and commenced operations by December 31, 2018 or earlier, and   certify that they have not received other forms of federal or state COVID-19 assistance or relief at the time of application, and   be in good standing and not in default with the State of Maryland and Baltimore County.     The county added grant funds must only be used for payroll, operating expenses, business lease or rent and inventory acquisition that is “vital” to the business, with at least 30 percent of the funds used to support payroll for non-owners.   They stipulated that funds may not be used for capital improvements or any personal expenses. If a business fails to reopen, all of the grant funds must be refunded to the county within 14 days.   For professional artists, musicians and performers, county executive Johnny Olszewski is making available the $100,000 for $1,000 stipends for up to 100 artists to help them with financial losses due to the pandemic.   Grants are first-come, first-served basis until the funds are gone and priority will be given to lower-income artists who $37,500 or less per year.   Applicants will submit a streamlined application, document their artistic portfolio, and must be adult Baltimore County residents over the age of 18. The application process will open on May 11, 2020 and details will be available on the Baltimore County  Office of Tourism and Cultural Arts webpage .   Artists can use these grants for recouping losses from canceled performances, art-related travel expenses, lost teaching opportunities and the loss of supplemental income for artists working in the service industry.   The county will also team up with the Community College of Baltimore County to launch a training program for contact trace investigators.   “At CCBC, we take pride in our ability to develop short-term training that can quickly prepare people for in-demand jobs,” said CCBC President Sandra Kurtinitis. “We are happy to participate in this partnership which will help secure the health and safety of our community as well as generate a pool of specially-trained candidates for new employment opportunities.”   Training will mainly be online and free for participants, with three training modules. The county’s department of health and human services anticipates they will need to hire 60 more contact trace investigators by July 2020 to fill the temporary positions.   There are 52 staff members working on contact tracing in the county.   For additional information on the training course, visit  www.ccbcmd.edu .

The lawsuit was filed in Maryland on Tuesday on behalf of six American citizens who were denied coronavirus relief checks because they filed and paid taxes with a spouse who has what’s known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or a way for immigrants without legal status to still pay federal taxes, which millions do.   MALDEF says the Treasury Department is violating Americans’ First and Fifth Amendments by denying them payment simply because of who they are married to. Congress last month passed a $2.2 trillion package to help businesses, workers and a health care system staggered by the coronavirus. Many Americans had their share deposited into their accounts in the last couple of weeks.   It’s estimated that 2 million U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are married to people without social security numbers, although it’s unclear how many of them file jointly with them.   “All of the families are very much like other families in the U.S. They have children at home, they are facing contraction of the economy and they still have to pay their rent, and buy groceries and buy gas,” said Nina Perales, MALDEF’s vice president of litigation.   Christina Segundo-Hernandez, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the plaintiffs in the case. Segundo-Hernandez is a U.S. citizen married to a Mexican immigrant who pays federal taxes through his ITIN. The couple, married eight years, file jointly each year. They’re both working fewer hours because of the coronavirus pandemic, and they’ve fallen behind on bills.   Getting a coronavirus relief check would have helped.   “I would have been able to fill up my refrigerator for my kids,” said Segundo-Hernandez, who has four children. “I think it needs to be known that there’s people out there that are doctors and things like that that are putting their lives at risk going through the same thing. They’re being betrayed by their government because of who they’re married to.”   David Hessell-Cercado, a fourth-grade teacher in Los Angeles, is an American citizen married to a Mexican immigrant who is close to getting his permanent resident status. Hessell-Cercado isn’t involved in the lawsuit, but will also not benefit from the coronavirus relief payments that went out to millions of Americans recently.   Hessell-Cercado said he feels lucky to still work, but thinks it’s unfair that Americans are being left out of the coronavirus relief package because of who they married.   “What hurt more was just the sheer meanness of it,” he said. “Anyone who marries someone and goes through an immigration process already has to deal with years and years and years of just delays and obstacles and hurdles to get over. It just seems like something else that they put out there just to sort of be mean to us.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The data shows just over half of the state’s COVID-19 deaths and more than one in five of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state have been at nursing homes, assisted living facilities and correctional facilities.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The highest number of cases at a nursing home is 220 at FutureCare In Lochearn. The highest number of deaths at a nursing home is 33 at Sagepoint Nursing and Rehabilitation in La Plata.   The 220 cases at FutureCare in Lochearn contribute to the high number in northwest Baltimore’s 21215 zip code, which has the fifth-most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state at 343.   With nursing homes hit hard by COVID-19, Jennifer Holmes is worried about her 85-year-old grandmother Jannette Johnson. Johnson, a resident of FutureCare Cherrywood in Reisterstown, was recently diagnosed with the virus.   “When I spoke to her yesterday, she was not feeling well,” Holmes said.   She recounted learning about the diagnosis through a phone call on Sunday.    “I was a little panicked when I answered the phone,” she said. “They let me know it wasn’t an emergency and explained to me that they had gone through and done a mass testing and that my grandmother had tested positive.”   Holmes said she has had difficulty getting more information.   “Just getting any answers is not easy. We need to know especially in nursing homes where you’re dealing with the elderly, and that’s affecting them far more than it is younger people. It’s important to know what’s going on,” she said. “My grandmother is 85 and she has underlying conditions. This is not good.”   The 471 fatalities reported statewide in Maryland’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities are more than half of the state’s total.

The data is part of an expanded set of information on  Baltimore’s website .   Maryland has created “strike teams” of medical professionals to respond to troubled nursing homes. These teams have been called in to help at Sagepoint, Pleasant View and FutureCare Lochearn.   There have also been 49 confirmed cases at the Prince George’s County Jail, where  inmates have sued the county  over its response to the virus.

(WJZ) —  A dog in North Carolina appears to be the first dog in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus, leading officials to caution humans with COVID-19 to distance themselves from their pets if possible.  CBS News reports  the dog named Winston is apparently the first pooch to test positive for the virus. The test was done as part of a study by Duke University.   Earlier this month, a tiger at a New York zoo also tested positive for the coronavirus,  CBS New York reported .   More research is needed, though, to determine how animals are affected by COVID-19 and if they may play a role in spreading the virus.   “We may learn more and what we say in a couple of weeks may be different in what we said right now,” Dr. Marianne Bailey with Queenstown Veterinary Hospital told WJZ Tuesday in the wake of the report.   Until more is known about the transmission of the virus between pets and humans, Bailey and the CDC say pet owners should limit their furry friends’ interactions with other pets and people outside the home, keep cats indoors when possible and avoid dog parks.

However, BGE said a construction worker, not a BGE employee or contractor, was working on underground steam lines in Annapolis near several state buildings when a gas odor was detected in the area.   The areas affected included Bladen Street, College Avenue and Rowe Boulevard.   The fire department and BGE were contacted and out of an abundance of caution the fire department evacuated the buildings. BGE crews inspected inside all of those buildings and didn’t detect gas odors in any of the buildings.     BGE said there was a slight gas odor outside in the surrounding areas.   Maryland Department of General Services said later Tuesday evening that BGE found a four-inch underground gas main that was struck and isolated the leak at around 3:30 p.m.   No injuries were reported.

Even though the coronavirus closed schools and canceled major school functions, Mackenzie Walker still wanted to get dressed up.   That afternoon, her cousin Meg Weinhold helped her curl her hair and do her makeup, but what Mackenzie did not realize is Meg was planning a surprise.   As Mackenzie was about to take off her dress Meg asked, “How long are you staying in your dress,”   “She’s like, ‘I’m going to change now and I’m like you can’t,” Meg said.   Mackenzie asked why as she looked outside to see a family friend, Matt Wilson, pulling into the neighborhood.   “I come outside and I see this truck with a trailer on it and a banner and it had prom 2020 on it with balloons and Matt comes out and he has flowers and everything,” Mackenzie said.     ‘She had the biggest smile I’ve ever seen- for her to be so excited and happy for that split second it was just remarkable and it a great great moment that ill always cherish for the rest of my life.’  Family friend surprises local high school junior on prom night  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/o6SSCvr87M   — Rachael Cardin (@RachaelCardin)  April 28, 2020     Come to find out Meg and Matt are personal trainers, both trying to keep their small business afloat by training people with an outdoor mobile gym.

The two took pictures and a few neighbors came out to see the two dressed for prom, and that was it.    Mackenzie said it was a special night, even without the dance.    “I think I’ll appreciate next year’s a lot but this one was really special and I feel like I’ll still remember it and cherish it as much as I would have,” said Walker.

Currently, Baltimore is at a 44.6% per household response — which is higher than many of our comparable cities like St. Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, New York and Cleveland. The mayor says the goal is to get 73% of households to respond.   “So once again while you’re staying home staying safe, please take 10 minutes to complete the census it is vitally important,” Young added.   City officials said they have shifted outreach methods, including holding virtual events to help inform city residents about completing the census.   Del. Stephanie Smith said to target how to count populations, they are phone banking since they cannot reach out in traditional ways.   “Another thing that we’ve done is a lot of these communities, they’re already the go-to community organizations for relief, for food for help, etc. So now we’re just finding a way to dovetail, any type of relief they’re providing to their neighbors, with some messages about the census,” Smith said.   They are also looking to put stickers on food boxes to inform people on how they can participate. They are working with religious institutions handing out food and giving them laptops so people can complete the census online.

The company is the largest US retailer to enact the rule, which is aimed at helping prevent the  spread of Covid-19 . Costco said the face coverings must be worn “at all times” in the store and will not serve as a “substitute for  social distancing .”   There are Costco locations in Glen Burnie, Middle River, Elkridge, Owings Mills, and Beltsville.   Certain exemptions are applied, including for customers under 2-years-old and people who can’t wear one because of a medical condition. Costco announced the changes Wednesday on its website.   Costco has enacted a number of changes to its stores as shoppers flock to big box stores for  necessities during the pandemic . Other changes include earlier closing times, limiting the number of guests a member can bring and giving first responders and healthcare workers  priority admittance into warehouses.    Walmart said in a statement to CNN Business that customer and employee safety is a “top priority” and it’s recommending, not requiring, customers wear face coverings. In March, the retailer began  taking workers’ temperatures at stores  and warehouses before their shifts and also made medical masks and gloves available for employees who want to wear them.   Several, but not all, US states  are requiring shoppers to wear masks when they visit essential businesses. Earlier in April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  recommended people wear face coverings  in public, but it’s not yet required.

The asteroid is called  52768 (1998 OR2) , and it was first spotted in 1998. On April 29, it will pass within 3,908,791 miles of Earth, moving at 19,461 miles per hour. That’s still 16 times farther than the distance between Earth and the moon.   The flyby happened at 5:56 a.m. ET, according to NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. The center tracks Near-Earth Objects, or NEOs, that could collide with Earth. They have been tracking this particular asteroid for 20 years, according to NASA.     You can watch it on  The Virtual Telescope’s website . Gianluca Masi, founder and scientific director of The Virtual Telescope in Italy, has been tracking and imaging it for some time.   If it did impact Earth, the asteroid is “large enough to cause global effects,” according to  NASA , back when the asteroid was first discovered.   And if an asteroid could be aware of such things, it appears to be wearing a face mask in deference to the pandemic, according to new images from Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.   “The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,” said Anne Virkki, head of planetary radar at Arecibo Observatory, in a statement. “But since we are all thinking about Covid-19, these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.”   Arecibo Observatory is a National Science Foundation facility managed by the University of Central Florida. A team of experts has been monitoring this near-Earth asteroid, among others. The observatory is supported by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Program and has been analyzing asteroids since the mid-’90s.   During the pandemic, scientists at Arecibo are continuing to make their observations on behalf of planetary defense. In line with social distancing, they have limited the number of scientists and radar operators at the facility, and they’re wearing masks during observations.   The asteroid was classified as a potentially hazardous object because it’s bigger than 500 feet and comes within 5 million miles of Earth’s orbit. The experts at Arecibo can monitor the asteroids and use observations to determine their path in the future to see if they pose a risk to Earth.   “The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,” said Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory, in a statement. “In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.”   It’s the largest asteroid expected to zip by Earth within the next two months, but it’s not the largest ever.   That honor belongs to the asteroid 3122 Florence (1981 ET3), which flew by and luckily missed colliding with Earth on September 1, 2017. It will make another pass again on September 2, 2057. That asteroid is estimated to be between two and a half and five and a half miles wide.   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The unrest forced Governor Larry Hogan to activate the National Guard for the first time since the 1960s. The city was also placed on a curfew.   On the five year anniversary, WJZ spoke with community leaders and residents in Penn North, the epicenter of the unrest. Despite the government-mandated consent decree and many changes in city leadership, every single person WJZ spoke with Tuesday said they believe nothing has changed in the five years since Gray’s death.   “Five years later after Freddie Gray? I feel as though nothing has changed,” Davon Fletcher said.   “I feel as though everything is still the same, ain’t nothing really change,” Chris Jones said.   “What everyone else watched on television we watched outside our door,” Ericka Alston Buck said. “We watched the National Guard standing with shields.”   Alston Buck operated the Kid Safe Zone in Sandtown-Winchester   “The mass chaos and confusions and fear, it was overwhelming,” she said. “It was overwhelming.”   “Every camera in the world was in Baltimore at that time,” said Carlmichael “Stokey” Cannady.   Cannady brought different groups together during the uprising in an attempt to bring calm.   “I had just left the funeral, it was surreal for me. I finally see what I watch in the 50s and on TV coming to fruition in our community,” he recalled. “We had a wound that was open and we were putting stitches on it and now it has spread so far we need staples.”   “Of course none of that should have happened, the burning up stuff. Burning up your own neighborhood, that’s what you did,” one resident told WJZ.   “Here it is now five years later and it’s a pandemic they are still on the corner suffering from drug addiction and homelessness,” Cannady said. “You can’t fix this overnight. Why wasn’t nothing invested into this neighborhood right after?”   Cannady said he believes things have gotten worse.   “I thought that was going to be a moment turned into a movement, but it became a moment turned into silence,” he said.   “When there is an international camera shining, yeah there are elected officials and everyone walking through and making safety checks,” Alston Buck said.   During the uprising, Alston Buck ran the Kids Safe Zone. She said there were days the facility provided a safe space for a hundred kids.

(WJZ) —  After a weekend of technical difficulties with the new Maryland unemployment application site, the Maryland Department of Labor is apologizing to Marylanders and says it has added new features to try to help with residents’ frustrations.  The BEACON One-Stop application launched at 7 a.m. Friday but saw multiple issues due to the volume of people trying to log on. Those issues continued off and on for most of the weekend,  until Sunday night  when the department claimed the site was back up, though many were still having issues.   “We were hopeful that our partnership with the vendor would provide rapid solutions. Instead, it has caused a series of challenges for applicants. The vendor’s platform could not sustain the volume of visitors to the site. This was not acceptable, and we are taking immediate actions to fix these problems,” the department said in a press release Monday.   The application will now be down nightly between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. until the problem is fixed to perform maintenance and resolve “any ongoing technical issues.”   Since the new one-stop application launched on Friday, there have been more than 179,000 accounts activated, more than 61,000 new claims filed and more than 138,000 weekly certifications submitted, according to the department.   To alleviate some frustrations as they work on the applications issues, the department is introducing a virtual waiting line where people can see how many people are ahead of them for site access and will get an estimated wait time that will be “constantly updated” and sign up to get an email about when the system is ready for them to access the platform.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   TIMELINE: Coronavirus In Maryland, Tracking The Spread   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The department said they anticipate this will make the process go more smoothly.   A new gating system is also being put in place.   On Sundays and Mondays, only customers who are filing weekly claim certifications will be able to file. If someone is unable to do so on those specific days, they are not restricted from filing it on any other day.   On Tuesdays through Saturdays, customers can file new claims and do other activities.   The new website is supposed to be designed to make it easier for people to apply for unemployment insurance in the state.   For weeks, newly jobless Marylanders have reported issues with filing for unemployment insurance as the state said it was overwhelmed by the number of applicants.   The site is meant to allow anyone who’s eligible for benefits, including CARES Act benefits and those previously required to file by phone, to file online. It also allows the self-employed to file for unemployment.   Gov. Larry Hogan said before the site launched, they had 40,000 calls backing up into their call center.

James Trudeau has been a photographer in the city for around 10 years, often taking photos at events and functions. Lately, he’s been shooting empty streets and masked faces in an effort to document history.   Through his lens, he said it’s a sad story.   “It’s unfortunate I have to document this story in history,” he said, calling it interesting but also depressing.   His black-and-white snapshots show a once-busy city that has become a ghost town and the lives of everyday residents trying to live their lives amid the pandemic. He has taken a series of photos of people wearing masks, hand washing, empty streets and what life looks like now.

He had his mask on, he has a police badge, fake handcuffs and he’s just still being a kid,” Trudeau recalled.

He has to get decked out in personal protective equipment and take precautions he has never had to take before to make sure he is protected and not carrying the virus out into his personal life   The new protocols are a daily “in-your-face” reminder of the danger.   “I can’t hug my kids until I take a shower and make sure I haven’t carried anything with me,” he said.   The desolate Baltimore Trudeau once saw filled with life, makes him yearn for brighter days ahead.   “I am looking forward to capturing the weddings, the networking events, the corporate events, so the best thing people can do is stay home, social distance, do what you gotta do until this can be over,” he said.

Jason Suggs works at the unemployment claims center in College Park and said it’s also frustrating working on the other side.   “On Friday, we rolled out a new application that allows Marylanders to file all types of claims entirely online,” Suggs said. “Unfortunately, we were not trained on the system until the night before its launch and a couple of hours in, the site crashed.”   RELATED COVERAGE:     After Weekend Of Technical Difficulties, New One-Stop Md.

Suggs participated in a call on Tuesday hosted by AFSCME, a union representing public employees.   “In the wake of COVID-19, we see how this process has clearly hurt public servants,” Suggs said.   He described an office short-staffed after states made cost-saving cuts to public services.   “We can’t be short-staffed when communities are counting on us,” He said.   Suggs said the system is flawed.   “We are facing an unemployment insurance system that is riddled with red-tape,” Suggs said.   He shares the story of one man crying to him on a call.   “A gentleman who tearfully described how he and his wife no longer have money to buy food for their four children. He shared this with me as I explained to him that after filing for six weeks and he finally got someone on the phone that he is ineligible for unemployment based on a technicality,” Suggs said. “By the end of the call, I was in tears as well.”   Suggs said people calling in oftentimes wait five hours just to speak to him.

Critical COVID-19 patients are dealing with anxiety from having difficulty breathing and being in a ventilator. They can also suffer from something known as ICU delirium, said Dr. Megan Hosey, a clinical psychologist who works with ICU patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital.   “ICU delirium is kind of scary,” she said. ”(They have) difficulty tracking where (they) are and what’s happening to (them) and in the worst-case situation they tell us a little bit about hallucinations and delusions they experience.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Even after beating the disease, there can be physical, mental and emotional symptoms remaining. This is known as post-intensive care syndrome.   “Something kind of special about our COVID patients is ours are telling us when they’re heading home they might be a little bit worried about things like COVID stigma, the fear of loved ones and the people around them becoming ill, and they’re also afraid of infecting other people,” Hosey said.   Because COVID-19 is a relatively new disease, they’re still working to see how PICS affects COVID-19 patients. Dr. Hosey said it affects up to 70 percent of people who live through a critical illness, and one thing that helps is getting back to activities typically done before the illness.   Also there to help is Johns Hopkins’ new outpatient clinic designed specifically for COVID patients. It’s made up of pulmonary doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists and rehab psychologists. They call them the Post Acute COVID Team or PACT.   “The good news is that we know about this now and so that there are rehab measures that we can put into place to try to help people recover,” Hosey said.

He now says he started chemotherapy on April 13 for stage 3 colon cancer.  While baseball has been on pause amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mancini has been away receiving treatment. Outside of a few statements here and there, fans haven’t heard too much from the outfielder about the situation.   That changed on Tuesday when Mancini published a letter in  The Player’s Tribune  entitled  “I Am So Lucky” . Normally, one wouldn’t think of a cancer diagnosis in that light, but upon reading the details of Mancini’s story, you begin to understand why the 27-year-old feels blessed.   RELATED STORIES:     Orioles Star Trey Mancini Promises To Keep Fans Updated After Leaving Team Due To Medical Issue   Baltimore Orioles Trey Mancini Had Malignant Tumor Removed, Lab Results, Recovery Timetable Unknown   ‘I’m Really Thankful’ | Orioles Star Trey Mancini Thanks Fans For Support After Undergoing Surgery To Remove Malignant Tumor     Mancini writes that when he took his initial physical at Spring Training with the team, doctors noted that the iron levels in his blood were low so they told him they needed to do another test. Thinking that a recent bout with the flu was likely the cause, Mancini assumed things would be fine and took another blood test. Instead, doctors found that his iron levels were even lower.     Trey Mancini’s revealing, emotional account of his cancer diagnosis & treatment.  “My treatment will take six months — every two weeks for six months. If baseball returns in 2020, it will probably be without me”. Wishing Trey health & strength!   @WJZ  ⚾️  https://t.co/QhLhPuvl81   — Mark Viviano (@MarkWJZ)  April 28, 2020     That second test then led to the colonoscopy to test for celiac disease or a stomach ulcer. The results of the colonoscopy, of course, was the finding of the tumor and diagnosis of cancer. As Mancini writes, without the Orioles’ medical staff’s attention to detail and pushing for that second test, who knows what would have happened.   “And without the Orioles I  never  would have caught this before it may have been too late. There was really no indication that anything was wrong other than me just feeling a little more tired than normal. Everything that comes up when you google colon cancer? I didn’t have any of it. And so without that second blood test I probably would not have discovered the tumor until I had a total blockage of my colon. Instead, from the day I was diagnosed to when the tumor was removed was just six days — March 6 to March 12.   I have Stage III colon cancer.I started chemotherapy on April 13.And I am  so  lucky.”     Mancini then goes on to thank both the organization and the fans for the support they have given him as he has gone through treatment. He says that he is surrounded by incredible people. And, though his treatment will take six months and even if baseball returns it will likely be without him, Mancini wants everybody to know that he’s okay. Even through his treatment for cancer, he is thinking of ways he can help those who have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.   “I know that this is a terrible time for everybody. So many people have lost jobs, so many people have lost loved ones. After my chemo is done, and when I’m totally cancer-free, I’ve got a few different ideas of what I can do. I’m lucky enough to have a platform that I feel allows me to make a difference for some people — even if it’s just spreading awareness about the importance of getting a physical every year.   On a smaller scale, I’d rather there be a baseball season right now. That way I could go to home games and hang out in the dugout and be with all the guys. So, I really wish there was a season going on and everything was normal. Baseball will be back. I don’t know when, but I’m sure the game will return.   I’ve got other things to worry about right now, though. I know that. But still, every once in a while I catch myself thinking ahead — to when chemo is over, to when they remove my port, to when I can start going full-speed again.   And I already can’t wait for spring training.”   Mancini isn’t the first Oriole to be diagnosed with colon cancer. Former Orioles outfielder Eric Davis was diagnosed with colon cancer in May 1997 and came back in 1998 to have an incredible season. He was named “Comeback Player of the Year” at the time.                                 ", "sentiment": 0.08894418423106948, "subjectivity": 0.4426945094977881, "wordcount": 783}

The Maryland Department of Human Services estimates that about 427,000 children will benefit from the program.   Maryland is one of 12 states whose plans have already been approved.   The delegation issued the following statement in a news release:   “Maryland students have lost primary access to healthy and nutritious food provided by their schools at the same time as food insecurity has spiked as a result of the pandemic. The state plan approved today will allow families to directly purchase food to feed their children, supplementing the free emergency meals being distributed by Maryland public schools. As a delegation, we are committed to working together to ensure that this and other forms of relief created through the Families First Coronavirus Response and CARES Acts make their way to Maryland families as swiftly as possible.”   This funding comes as a result of the CARES Act, which provided $8.8 billion in additional funding for child nutrition programs in order to ensure children receive meals while school is not in session.    Since the temporary school closures began on March 16, Maryland schools and agencies have been providing free emergency meals to children 18 years and younger.   As of April 25, Maryland local school systems have served more than 6.4 million meals across 698 meal sites.   Like regular SNAP benefits, P-EBT benefits will be issued via EBT card to households of children who would have received free or reduced-price meals.   Monthly assistance will be calculated based on the daily rate of $5.70 per child for each day that the child’s school was closed in a particular month.

Travel is exactly what you don’t want people to be doing in a situation like this. And they were crowding stores. There’s a demand for beer, wine and spirits in a time like this. And not satisfying them in a community can be dangerous.”   Strictly speaking, alcohol isn’t needed to survive like, say, food. Grocery stores are obviously essential, as are banks and pharmacies and gas stations. While the definition of ‘essential’ can be a little loose, sellers of wines and spirits don’t make the rules. They do, however, have to conduct business in an extremely restrictive  economic climate .   Business, so far, has been good for wine shops, or at least better than what could have been. Some of it resulted from a general initial uncertainty about just what the coming weeks held. “There was a bit of a panic in the beginning,” recounts Vega about his experience at New York’s Table Wine. “People… they didn’t realize that we were going to be able to stay open. Business those first couple weeks was very brisk. There were a few days that almost felt like the holidays as far as business.”   Fishman at Quarry Wine & Spirits in Baltimore has noticed a similar level of urgency among many of his customers. Then again “We’re definitely seeing people buying more,” he said. “The customer count is about the same, but the average sale is up.”   Increased sales, combined with additional free time spent inside, may very well point to heightened consumption. Certainly broad stay-at-home orders create ample time for distraction. And anecdotal evidence from social media suggests drinking has become a quarantine pastime.   What types of wines are people turning to to fill the hours? At Table Wine, “they’re more of the value wines,” says Vega. “We have the 12-[dollars]-and-under table. They definitely sell a lot. Some of the more expensive wines that we usually don’t sell as much, sometimes people are going that route as well. But overall it’s definitely a little bit value-oriented, things that people are used to.”   Another explanation for steady wine sales could be the need for comfort. Many consumers are seeking out comfort foods as a way to find some security in nostalgia. Familiarity is probably also a factor for wine consumers who just want to drink what they know.   Regardless, price is always a factor in an uncertain economy. “Some people are being a little bit more economical because times are difficult,” notes Fishman of Quarry Wine and Spirits. “Some people who are maybe use to going out to dinner more often find it to be not as expensive, so they’re splurging a little bit on the wine. It’s been a little bit of both.”   Selling these essential wines to wanting consumers has led to some logistical challenges. Social distancing must be maintained at all times, so neither Table Wine nor Quarry Wine & Spirits allow customers in their store. But location is also a factor.   Table Wine is located on a once-busy shopping avenue in a Queens neighborhood where people tend to shop on foot. Without that foot traffic, and without an app, the telephone becomes the lifeline. “The best thing, if you’re doing it for pickup, is to call,” says Vega. “We’ll figure out what you want, figure out your order. We will take your credit card information to process everything there over the phone, and we’ll have your bottles waiting. No one is allowed in the store, so we do have a bench outside blocking our entrance-way. When you do walk up to the door, we’ll notice you outside. We’ll open the door, ask you your name. We’ll ask you to back up. We’ll put your items on the bench, and then we’ll back up. You pick up your items.”   This coronavirus six-foot two-step changes when cars are involved. Quarry Wine & Spirits is located in a tastefully manicured strip mall and does much of its business through its website and app.   “We have an online portal, basically a store on our website. So basically customers can place an order and [give us] the time. And we have it ready for them. And we can bring it to their car, curb-side pickup.”   Going to this model almost exclusively has presented yet more challenges. Quarry Wine & Spirits was in the process of transitioning to a more robust website and app when the world changed. The new systems is “…a lot more labor intensive for us to fill the orders because we’re pulling them all ourselves.”   Busy employees can be a positive sign. And things are so busy at Quarry that they’ve had to hire additional associates to help with the workload, even as the  jobless rate  sinks deeper into double digits. Optimism is hard to come by these days. Wave after wave of bad news threatens to drown us all. But wine stores remain open and supported by their customers, proving their essential nature in these difficult times.

(WJZ) —  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan apologized Wednesday to residents struggling to file from unemployment through the state’s new portal.  “I want to take just a moment to personally address every Marylander who has had difficulty dealing with the serious problems on the state unemployment insurance website,” Hogan said during a press conference. “With all of the economic struggles that people are already going through, they should not have to worry about getting the resources that they need and that they deserve.”   The BEACON portal launched nearly a week ago and is supposed to be a one-stop shop for Marylanders who are eligible for benefits to apply. But some residents say they have been struggling to file online, sometimes being put in a queue of users or the site crashing when they try to apply.   “The system keeps crashing,” Janice Moore told WJZ.   “It knocked me off, I was back to server error,” Kathy Poole said.   Hogan said more than 245,000 accounts have been activated since the launch and more than 100,000 new claims were filed.     Since the launch of the BEACON One-Stop unemployment insurance application, over 245,000 accounts have been activated, over 100,000 new claims have been submitted, and over 273,000 weekly certifications have been filed.   — MD Department of Labor (@MD_Labor)  April 29, 2020     CORONAVIRUS REFERENCE:     Coronavirus Resources: Maryland To Launch New ‘One-Stop’ Unemployment Benefits Website On April 24   How To File For Unemployment In Maryland   Here’s A New Email To Get Your Unemployment Questions Answered In Maryland   Coronavirus Pandemic Leave You Unemployed?

With 40 percent of the vote in, Mfume has just over 62 percent of the vote in Baltimore County and just over 59 percent in Howard County. He earned nearly unanimous support — just over 94 percent — in Baltimore City. Republican Kimberly Klacik has just under 38 percent of the vote in Baltimore County and just under 41 percent in Howard County.   Overall, Mfume has 73 percent of the vote compared to Klacik’s 27 percent.   Mfume, who held the seat prior to the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, said his first order of business is helping people through this dark time during the COVID-19 pandemic.   “I promise you that as your congressman, I will use every ability that I have to bring about that change,” he said in his victory speech.   Due to the coronavirus, the majority of voting was conducted by mail, officials reported.   Ballots that were postmarked by Tuesday will be counted, but they will be quarantined for 24 hours after being received to protect election workers. It’s not immediately clear when the final results will be posted.   In total, the state sent out more than 482,000 ballots.   COVID-19 was a significant barrier to campaigning, Klacik said.   “It’s been difficult, it’s been different because I’m more of an ‘in your face’ kind of person, I like to meet people one-on-one,” she said.   While three in-person voting sites were open, fewer than 1,000 people voted in-person as of 6:20 p.m. Meanwhile, the state reported receiving more than 110,000 mail-in ballots, and more will continue to come in over the coming days.   At Martin’s West, the sole in-person voting site in Baltimore County, voter Sharon Lee said she preferred the certainty of voting in-person over mailing in her ballot.   “I felt like my vote would be counted,” she said. “If I mailed it in, it may get misplaced in the mail or not get counted so I know if I do it personally, it’s done.”   Kenneth Brown, who worked on Mfume’s campaign, said the coronavirus made this one something quite different.   “I work a lot of campaigns, been involved in a lot of campaigns, and in my lifetime this is different,” he said. “Who knows where it goes from here? Is this the new norm?”   Mfume will now run as the incumbent in the state’s crowded June 2 primary election.   Click here for the latest results .

(WJZ) —  The FBI and Maryland State Police are looking for two missing Maryland women who have ties to two men charged in the murder of a 33-year-old Carroll County man.  The FBI report missing 18-year-old Danielle Tyler and 33-year-old Heather Grogg could be traveling together and are “in danger.” They were last seen in Carroll County on April 6.     #FBI  Pittsburgh is looking for Heather Grogg and Danielle Tyler. They were were last seen in Carroll County, Maryland on April 6, 2020. If you have any information concerning this case, please contact the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office at (412) 432-4000.  pic.twitter.com/HUjKEvQNJQ   — FBI Pittsburgh (@FBIPittsburgh)  April 23, 2020     The case is now getting national attention after authorities learned the two missing women had links to suspects recently arrested in the March 18 murder of  Jonathan Riddle, also of Taneytown .   Three suspects arrested in the murder of Jonathan Riddle.   John Black III, Monroe Merrell and David Sanford, Jr.  were all charged in early April for Riddle’s kidnapping and brutal murder. A fourth person, Emily Day, was also recently charged in the murder, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s office reported to WJZ.   According to the sheriff’s office, Riddle’s body was found burning near the woods in an extremely rural area of Rippon, West Virginia, by a passerby around 7:35 a.m. on the morning of March 18. Rippon is about 30 miles southwest of Frederick.   Police believe that Riddle was alive when he was taken to the rural area. A medical examiner determined Riddle died from multiple stab wounds and blows to the head, court documents show.   A Jefferson County sheriff’s deputy learned a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with Maryland plates 9BY0804 may be linked to the crime. That car was later located outside a Westminster home. Merrell, 22, was at the residence when police found it. According to the charging documents, Merrell seemed nervous and Holz saw a small cut on his right hand.   Trio Charged After Taneytown Man’s Body Found On Fire In West Virginia, Police Say   The car was seized and police found a bloodstain on the passenger door.   According to court documents, Riddle went to Sanford’s apartment on March 17 to allegedly meet Heather Grogg who was staying there. Grogg, a mother of four, was Sanford’s live-in babysitter,  according to Oxygen , which spoke with Grogg’s sister.   It was there the victim reportedly got into an argument with Merrell. Police learned Riddle was stabbed twice inside the home then taken to West Virginia where he was allegedly stabbed again and set on fire. Sanford, who was arrested on April 9, and Merrell were both charged in Riddle’s murder.   “I worry that maybe if she witnessed this or if she knows too much that’s why she’s in critical danger,” Brandi Hebb, Grogg’s sister told Oxygen. “It’s not like her to drop off the face of the earth.”   Danielle Tyler was dating Merrell, according to her grandmother, who also spoke to Oxygen. Tyler is a high school senior whose school went online in March following the coronavirus pandemic. Her grandmother last heard from her on April 6.   “I love her more than life itself,” Sherry Tyler told Oxygen. “All she has to do is reach out and I will be there.”   Heather Grogg and Danielle Tyler (left to right)   Tyler is 5-foot-3 and 110 pounds with blonde hair and green eyes. She has snake bite piercings on either side of her lower lip and a small nose ring in both sides of her nose. Known to wear wrist accessories bracelets hair ties, she always carries her backpack. She has a black one and red one. She carries her wallet, flat iron, makeup, etc.   Grogg is 5-foot-2 and 175 pounds with red or blonde hair with blue eyes. She has a lip piercing below her lower right lip.   Riddle is survived by his wife Diana, his stepchildren and parents.   Merrell was arrested on April 15 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He has not waived extradition and we are advised that his next court date is scheduled for May 18. Black was arrested on April 15 in Taneytown, Maryland.   On April 24, the sheriff’s office arrested a fourth person, Emily Rose Day, in Westminster. Day is being charged as an accessory before and after the fact in Riddle’s murder. She is currently being held in Maryland awaiting a court appearance to determine if she will waive extradition to West Virginia .   “This investigation is not over and the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in coordination with other law enforcement agencies continues to follow leads in this case,” said Jefferson County Sheriff Pete Dougherty.   In a statement, FBI Pittsburgh said it “works closely with our law enforcement partners to investigate threats to the community. The safety and welfare of those involved and the integrity of any investigation are always the first priorities for the FBI. At this time, we are not able to release any additional information.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan issued Wednesday an executive order that requires universal testing of residents and staff at all Maryland nursing homes.  Facilities will be prioritized based on an “imminent outbreak or a current rising threat risk,” according to the Hogan administration.   “Even when best practices and care is in place, this virus may still be transmitted by asymptotic staff, meaning that every patient interaction comes with some risk,” Gov. Hogan said.   Under the order, it will be mandatory for facilities to fully comply with strike teams deployed by the state. All nursing homes must have a physician, nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant or registered nurse to evaluate all residents on a daily basis.   Along with that, all facilities must develop “surge staffing plans” to ensure continuity of care in the event of an outbreak.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The governor announced new “bridge teams” to provide emergency clinical staffing.   Each bridge team will have a registered nurse and five to seven aides, sufficient to care for up to 100 skilled nursing home residents per shift.   The teams will be fully vetted and are ready to be immediately deployed to provide 24-hour coverage for nursing homes in a crisis, the administration said.   Nursing homes must also regularly update residents and staff and families on cases within their facilities.   Forty-six percent of the state’s coronavirus deaths are based in nursing homes, the governor said Wednesday. Nineteen percent of cases, in general, are coming from these facilities as well.   Outbreaks or clusters of cases have popped up at 278 facilities across the state, including 4,011 confirmed cases at 143 different Maryland nursing homes.   WJZ spoke with one employee at a Baltimore nursing home who wished to not be identified.   “Really, it’s been very difficult trying to cope because you’re afraid daily that you’re going to end up in the hospital,” the nurse said.   Family members of nursing home residents in Maryland also raised concerns.   “It should’ve been done for at least the in the last three or four weeks,” Rick Mantheiy, a family member of a Pleasant View Nursing Home resident, said. “We could’ve really lessened the deaths, especially in Maryland, if we would’ve done more with nursing homes as a focus.”   Because of this concern, the governor has appointed Colonel Eric Allely, state surgeon of the Maryland National Guard, to serve as an emergency safety and compliance officer for Maryland nursing homes.   Allely will be tasked with directing a multi-agency team to ensure compliance with state law during the pandemic.   Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson weighed in on the nursing home outbreaks during a virtual legislative panel.

So, here’s what you can do. If you’re sitting for more than four hours—especially in front of a screen—you can put yourself at risk of blood clots.   Sandy said keep your blood moving by taking a break to walk, stretch and encourage good posture with a supportive chair or by rolling a towel to use as support.   “Yoga is something that we call a moving meditation, so you’re getting the physical stretches to stretch the body, to strength the abdominal core, but you’re also getting the mental quieting of the mind,” she said.   Dr. Sandy said many patients right now are experiencing insomnia because of the rigorous lifestyle change.   Another problem is isolation skin. More breakouts, itchiness and dryness—mainly triggered by stress. Allergies, and even overeating—are directly linked to COVID-19, Sandy said.

Pro football? Not likely — not for a 5-foot-9 quarterback at the Naval Academy.   Then the Midshipmen started 7-1, with Perry rushing for 16 touchdowns, and he became less sure about what uniform he might wear in 2020.   “I first started thinking the NFL was a possibility around midseason,” Perry says. “I kind of felt like I had the ability to do it, was having a good year and might get the shot.”   He will. Last week the Miami Dolphins selected Perry in the seventh round, making him the only service academy player drafted this year, and the latest to attempt the long leap to the NFL.   Perry will be able to turn pro this year thanks to a policy change initiated by President Trump. New guidelines issued in November allow service academy graduates to seek delaying their military commitment to play pro sports, and Perry’s request for a waiver is expected to be granted.   “It means a lot,” Perry says, “because I know a lot of guys that I played with in the past who didn’t get the opportunity, but definitely had the talent.”   The son of two Army veterans, Perry will still owe the Marines five years of active duty whenever his NFL career ends.   The Dolphins list Perry as a running back, but they’re also expected to give him a look as a slot receiver and kick returner. He trained as a receiver in the weeks leading up to the draft, and that was his position at the NFL combine.   Perhaps new Dolphins offensive coordinator Chan Gailey will also try Perry as a wildcat triggerman. In the Shrine Bowl, Perry took a direct snap for his only carry and ran 52 yards for a touchdown.   Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo envisions Perry as a hybrid player in the mold of three-time Pro Bowler Darren Sproles.   “I think the transition to slotback is going to be easy for him,” Niumatalolo says. “He has done great things against all the best competition we’ve played. Athletically he’s one guy from our team who didn’t look out of place against them. He’s dynamic with the ball in his hands and has great hands.”   Perry knows the odds are against him. Only four players from Navy, Army or Air Force played in the NFL last year, and none has ever played in a game for the Dolphins.   There have been recent success stories. Alejandro Villanueva of Army, undrafted as a rookie, has become a two-time Pro Bowl left tackle with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Long snapper Joe Cardona of Navy has won two Super Bowl rings with the New England Patriots. Ben Garland, a defensive lineman from Air Force, has made the playoffs four times with three teams.   Several former military academy players signed as rookie free agents with NFL teams after last week’s draft, including Army linebacker Cole Christiansen.   “Probably most everyone in college football is pretty aware of who we are, who Navy is, who Air Force is at this point,” Christiansen says. “But I think the average person might not be totally aware that we’re a good football team to contend with each year, being a program that can produce guys that can play in the league.”   Perry is just the sixth Naval Academy graduate to be drafted during the Super Bowl era. Former Midshipmen quarterback Keenan Reynolds, a sixth-round pick in 2016, spent time with three teams and is now out of the league.   But Perry is different, Niumatalolo says.   “Keenan was a pure quarterback,” the coach says. “Malcolm played the quarterback position to help us win, but if he had his druthers, I think he probably would have wanted to play slotback. We asked him to move to quarterback for our team, because we’re an option team.”   And Perry was terrific operating the triple option. He ran for 2,017 yards as a senior, an FBS record for a quarterback, including 304 yards against Army with Trump on hand. The Midshipmen tied a school record with 11 wins and finished in the Top 20 for only the second time in 56 years.   A quantitative economics major, Perry can analyze a situation, including his chances of earning an NFL paycheck. He figures time management skills he learned at the academy will help. But to make the Dolphins’ roster, he expects he’ll need to be ready for any role, and to shine on special teams.   And he has a fallback.   “If the NFL doesn’t work out,” he says, “I’ll be a Marine Corps officer.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

(WJZ) —  As businesses remain closed across Maryland, many shop owners are wondering what restrictions will be in place when they’re finally able to open their doors.  A few business owners in Annapolis are trying to make sure they have the best chance of surviving, when that time comes.   Lisa Bolter, the Co-Owner of the Red Red Wine Bar, said since closing their doors on March 15, their focus has been on one thing.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “All of our thoughts, all of our ideas, all of our sleepless nights are about how do we reopen and what that’s going to look like for us,” Bolter explained.   One thing that seems all but certain is that restrictions will be in place when many businesses do reopen.   “The idea of opening at 40 percent is a little scarier than not being open,” Bolter said.   That’s because the money they would make wouldn’t cover the expense of being open.   To compensate, Bolter isn’t just thinking outside the box, she’s thinking outside the building.   She would like to shut down Main Street, in Annapolis, for a few hours each night to allow them to put tables outside.   “Depending on who you are, and where you are, that could give you up to 10 extra seats, that makes up for a huge difference,” Bolter said.   This Isn’t just for restaurants.   Fern Elliot thinks it would be beneficial for her boutique, Lilac Bijoux.   “I would love to put some racks out there,” Elliot said. “People would probably feel safer to walk to it and look at it and have more space for everyone.”   A petition started in favor of the idea. It garnered 500 signatures in just 24 hours.   The city already shuts down West Street on Wednesday nights in the summer for “Dining Under the Stars.”   The idea of allowing other streets to do the same is an idea the newly created Small Business recovery task force can get behind.   “It’s the kind of event I could possibly be a drawl, to bring people to the city, so it’s definitely something that could happen,” Stephen Rice, the city’s Economic Development Manager and Co-Chair of the Committee, said.   In total, that committee is made up of nearly four dozen people from various backgrounds.   They will be working with business owners to try to get things back to normal as soon as possible, while seeking help from the local state and federal governments.

This week, the Small Business Administration made $310 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funding available to small businesses across the country to pump money into the struggling economy.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     It’s a program that’s kept local businesses stay afloat   “It allows people, employees, small businesses to come back to keep going during this hard time,” Luke Bernstein, Orrstown Bank’s Executive Vice President, said.   It’s the second round of the program, and the bank has helped Maryland and Pennsylvania business owners get $370 million in commercial loans in just two weeks.   “We did more small business loans in 14 days than we did small business loans in our entire 101-year history,” Bernstein said.   Bernstein added that’s why he was asked to go and meet with President Donald Trump to discuss the impact of the program on dozens of local businesses.     “To take all of those collective stories down to the highest office in the land was pretty humbling,” he said.   With the help of Orrstown, Keith Williams received $900,000 for his business, Northbay Adventure. It’s an outdoor education program for kids in North East Maryland.   Williams works with schools to stay in business, but that all changed when the COVID-19 pandemic started.   “Our business is based on school students coming to us, and so as soon as schools closed down, we had no revenue coming in,” he said.   Williams said because of it, they’re able to pay and employ their 140 staff members through June. Its also allowed them to maintain their property and even invest in online programs.   “We’re extremely grateful that we have the opportunity to continue doing meaningful work,” he said.

(WJZ) —  Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday a new testing site would be opening in response to outbreaks at poultry processing plants along the Eastern Shore.  WJZ spoke to some of the poultry workers Thursday who expressed concern surrounding the recent COVID-19 outbreak at these plants.   Two women, who wished to remain unidentified out of fear, are employees at Amick Farms in Hurlock.

Coronavirus Latest: State Opening Testing Site At Perdue Facility In Salisbury Amid COVID-19 Outbreak In Maryland Poultry Workers   “Any disruption or interruption in processing at our poultry processing plants could lead to significant national supply chain issues,” Gov. Hogan said.   State epidemiologists, the CDC and FEMA are responding to the Delmarva Peninsula in response.   “We are opening a testing site at Perdue Stadium in Salisbury,” Hogan added.   One worker said even if employees test positive, they’re still coming back into work.   “They are calling people and asking them to come back within maybe a couple of days,” the employee said. “You have some people that are coming back within a day or two.”   Amick Farms corporate offices in South Carolina said they are providing “each team member with appropriate PPE” and are conducting daily thorough cleanings at all its farms.   Employees, however, still feel like they’re left in the dark.   “You’re coming here, you’re risking your life,” an employee said. “I feel like we should be informed more this is real serious.”   WJZ reached out to Amick Farms about what these employees had to say.

Try eating food that helps you  relax  naturally.   If you’re experiencing nervousness, racing thoughts, difficulty getting to sleep, or even panic during the  coronavirus pandemic , you’re not alone. This is an  extremely stressful time ; it’s only natural that we’d feel a little amped and uneasy.   If you’re having trouble relaxing , avoiding  sugar  and  caffeine  is a must. These ingredients can further stress our bodies and set us up for anxiety. On the flip side, there are foods that can help support our nervous system, increase our resiliency to stress, and even make us feel calm right after we eat them.   As we move through this crazy time, let’s lean on these 9 foods that promote relaxation.   Related Reading:   How to Shop for Groceries If You’re Concerned About Coronavirus     1. Kefir     Photo Credit: Lauren Volo     A fermented drink that falls somewhere between  yogurt  and milk,  kefir  is a great addition to your social distancing routine. It can be made from dairy milk or  nut milk  and contains high amounts of beneficial bacteria, which support a healthy gut microbiome. At first glance, our gut health might seem unrelated to our nervous systems, but it’s actually quite the opposite. Studies have shown not only that  stress can alter the microbiome  in undesirable ways, but that  anxiety could actually be alleviated  by regulating gut bacteria.   You can drink kefir plain or use it as a creamy base for recipes like in this  Chilled Avocado, Cucumber, and Kefir  Soup  recipe by Julie Smolyansky.   2. Salmon     Photo Credit: Chowhound     Fatty fish like  salmon  are full of omega-3 fatty acids, which have proven to be extremely beneficial for calming the nervous system. In fact, a systematic review of 19 clinical trials—published in  JAMA Open Network —showed that improvements in anxiety symptoms were associated with omega-3 fatty acid treatment. Try this  Maple Mustard Grilled Salmon recipe  from Christine Gallary and add salmon to the menu a few times a week.   Related Reading:  The Best Places to Buy Fresh Seafood Online   3. Tart Cherries      Photo Credit: Chowhound     Tart cherries  contain high levels of various phytochemicals, including melatonin. You’ve probably heard of melatonin before; it’s known as the “sleep hormone” because our bodies release it in the evening to help us get to sleep. Well,  studies have shown  that consuming tart cherry juice increases melatonin levels and can improve sleep quality and duration. If you’re having trouble winding down at night, tart cherries might be the perfect food to lean on. For other  foods that can help you sleep, read this .   4. Cucumbers      Photo Credit: Chowhound     Have you ever wondered why  cucumber water  is so popular? It could be because the smell of  cucumbers  has natural stress-relieving properties. And it’s not only the smell, either; this low-sugar fruit also contains B vitamins, which help support our central nervous system. In fact,  studies  have shown that a B complex vitamin can improve anxiety symptoms compared to placebo.   5. Lemons     Photo Credit: Chowhound     Plenty of studies have found interesting links between vitamin C and mood. In fact, one study on 42 high school students showed that  vitamin C actually lowered anxiety levels . Citrus fruits—like  lemons ,  limes , oranges, and grapefruit—are one of the best ways to get vitamin C in your diet. Here’s  how to segment citrus  for easy, mess-free eating.   6. Vegemite        Amazon     You might not think of Vegemite as a health food, but  one study , published in 2018, showed that people who consume yeast-based spreads—such as  Marmite, Vegemite , Promite, and Aussiemite—have lower levels of anxiety and stress. According to the researchers, the B vitamin content in these spreads is likely to thank for their anxiety-reducing powers. To start using Vegemite, try spreading it thinly on one side of a  grilled cheese sandwich . It adds a bitter, salty flavor that you may just learn to love.   7. Onions       Chowhound     Onions  are one of the best sources of  prebiotic fiber , which helps to feed healthy gut bacteria. As we now know, a balanced microbiome is essential for optimal mental health. Other sources of prebiotic fiber include leeks,  bananas ,  garlic , and  apples . Try adding raw onions to salads or whips of this  Easy Caramelized Onions recipe  from Aida Mollenkamp.   8. Pumpkin Seeds      Photo Credit: Chowhound     Pumpkin seeds  are one of the best sources of magnesium, which is often referred to as the “relaxation” mineral and is one of the top  stress-relieving nutrients . Many of us are deficient in magnesium, as processed foods are virtually devoid of this mineral, but luckily, pumpkin seeds provide more than 150 mg of magnesium per cup, which is almost 50 percent of your daily recommended intake. Try this  Homemade Pumpkin Seed Milk recipe , from the book “ Magnesium Everyday Secrets .”   Related Reading:   This Pumpkin Sourdough Focaccia Is the Perfect Accompaniment to Any Stew   9. Dark Chocolate      Photo Credit: Amazon     Lucky you: Research published in the  Journal of Proteome Research  found that eating about 1½ ounces of  dark chocolate  per day can actually lead to lower levels of cortisol, which is one of our primary stress hormones. For extra relaxation benefits, dark chocolate also contains significant levels of magnesium. Just make sure you opt for dark chocolate and if you’re not sure what to buy, these are the  best dark chocolate bars  out there.   Focusing on these foods can help promote relaxation, peaceful sleep, and a sense of calm despite what’s going on outside. Luckily, most of these foods are also affordable, delicious, and can be prepared in any number of creative ways.   Article provided by CBS sister site  Chowhound.com .

We’re so disconnected because we are used to sitting down and talking face to face and you can’t do it now,” she said   Since 2007, Bailey has been working at Johns Hopkins. She works in a unit with 24 beds and right now, they are all occupied with severely ill COVID 19 patients.   Some of the serious cases die while at the hospital and Bailey said the staff at Johns Hopkins has tried to let family see their loved one before they pass.   “It’s very difficult to do that but we have been able to, but it’s still an end of life situation and its terrible,” she said.   Working extra hours at the hospital, on the front lines of this fight since the outbreak began, now with new protocols and coming home to a family who needs her care, Bailey said it is a lot to handle.   She showers at the office and leaves her scrubs there to be washed so she does not expose her family. Bailey said, “that takes an extra half hour to hour so I’m missing out on that time being home with my family and then I come home and its immediate ‘mom mode.’”   Bailey said though the struggles have been many, and the challenges have been constant the community has rallied around health care workers unlike ever before and she said they appreciate the love and support. “I can probably speak for everybody; never have I done this job for the praise or the thanks, but it is really nice to see health care workers getting recognized,” she said.   Gov. Hogan’s orders to stay home and social distance yourself is helping, Bailey said, keep the numbers inside hospitals manageable. She encourages people to continue following safe practices so this pandemic can be over.

We asked  vegetarian chefs  to reveal their secrets to making insanely delicious tofu. Here are their tips and tricks.   1. Buy the Right Type of Tofu                                 View this post on Instagram                                            Are you a tofu-noob? Welcome to the world of this bountiful bean. We’ve put together an easy guide to explain the different types of tofu. So if you’re embarking on a #veganuary journey of discovery and feeling a bit bewildered, or if you just like reading about tofu, we hope this will help! Link in the bio #vegan #tofu #tofupress #plantbased #poweredbyplants #vegansofinstagram #vegansofig #veganlife #whatveganseat   A post shared by   Tofuture  (@tofutureltd) on  Jan 10, 2020 at 8:45am PST         The biggest mistake people make with tofu happens not in their kitchen, but at the grocery store. They buy the wrong type of tofu for their dish. Tofu comes in a few varieties based on their density, ranging from silken to regular, firm, extra firm, and super firm.   “Each type has its own purpose, and it’s not one size fits all,” said Suzannah Gerber, vegan executive chef at Haven Foods and author of  “The Plant-Based Gourmet: Vegan Cuisine for the Home Chef.”   Silken tofu , commonly used in miso  soup , easily blends into things like custards and creams, she explained. Regular tofu works well for a crumbly  scramble , while the firmer varieties can be fried, sauteed, or baked into chewy meat-like protein. Make sure you get the right kind of tofu for the dish you plan to make.   2. Get the Water Out     Photo Credit: Amazon     Tofu typically comes packed in a container of water that keeps it fresh. While you can simply drain and use silken tofu as is, you’ll need to get the water out of the firmer varieties if you want them to taste good.   “ Pressing tofu  is key in getting the best texture and firming it up for cooking,” said  Amy Webster , a vegan chef who works with the  Humane Society of the United States  to train food service professionals at schools on cooking plant-based cuisine.   To press tofu, you can wrap it in a clean dish towel or paper towels and put it between two heavy objects (I use bulky cutting boards) for at least 30 minutes. You can also get fancy with a device specifically designed for pressing tofu (like  this one from Amazon ).     After it’s pressed, cut your block of tofu into medium-size cubes (I usually slice it in half length-wise, then cut each side into 16 equal-size pieces) to get it ready for cooking.   3. Make an Awesome Marinade     Photo Credit: Chowhound   Easy Asian Broiled Tofu     Marinating tofu can give it flavor from the inside out. But what should you marinate it in? The answer depends on which veg chef you ask, and comes down to whatever flavors you prefer.   “I like tofu best with Asian flavor profiles: ginger, garlic, shoyu, citrus, and sesame oil all work great,” said  Ann Ziata , a plant-focused chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education.   “I focus on enhancing the tofu with umami, so I’ll marinate it in soy sauce and a touch of  liquid smoke ,” said chef Caroline Concha of  Mohawk Bend , who turned the entire menu at  Beelman’s  pub vegan.   Related Reading:   12 Delicious Vegan Sauces to Put on Everything   “My go-to tofu marinade is soy, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and grated garlic,” said  Colada Shop ’s chef Mario Monte, who is a vegan.   Experiment with hot sauces, citrus juices, salad dressings, herbs, and spices to get the flavor you’re looking for, and let the tofu sit in the marinade for at least two hours (or longer, if possible!). Then, pop the tofu on a lightly greased baking sheet and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes, flipping halfway. Your efforts will pay off in highly flavorful cubes that can be added to salads, stir-fries, ramen, or simply eaten on their own.   4. Rub It With Spices—and Cornstarch     Photo Credit: Chowhound   Grilled Tofu Torta     While a marinade can help tofu develop flavor from within, tossing it in spices and other substances can enhance the texture and taste of tofu externally. Cornstarch helps it crisp up.   “For spicy tofu bites, remove tofu cubes from a hot sauce marinade and toss them in cornstarch seasoned with salt, garlic powder, and paprika, to make them extra crispy,” suggested Stephany Burgos, a vegan and executive chef at  The Wilson . “Heat the pan, add about a half inch of oil and shallow fry the tofu. Once crispy, remove the tofu from the pan and toss it in some of the leftover marinade.” You could also skip the marinade entirely, and instead use a dry spice rub and pan-sear the tofu for a crispy treat, said Guy Vaknin, executive chef at  Beyond Sushi .   5.

Silken tofu can also be turned into a dairy-free substitute for ricotta by putting it into a food processor with garlic, olive oil, sea salt, and rosemary, said chef-instructor  Olivia Roszkowski , who specializes in plant-forward cuisine at the Institute of Culinary Education.

Orioles pitcher Kohl Stewart is new to the team after starting his career in Minnesota. He’s given a lot of thought to what it will take for conditions to be safe enough for games to resume.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Stewart said he has concerns about how players share close quarters when they’re together, a challenge when trying to avoid the spread of COVID-19.   “What happens if one guy tests positive, and all 50 guys are around that guy?” Stewart said. “In the clubhouse, it’s almost impossible to maintain a six-foot distance. We’re all getting in the same hot tub together, or we’re all using the same trainer. It’s just really going to come down to: Do we have the amount of tests? And we test guys on a weekly basis. Hopefully we get to a point where that’s possible.”   Stewart emphasized that while he’s pessimistic, he hopes he’s wrong.

The Maryland Food Bank stands ready to help with a new food supply.   The food bank received Thursday a generous donation from Royal Farms.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Traditionally, we get a million pounds of food from retailers that helps support the food bank,” Rick Condon, of the Maryland Food Bank, said. That number has significantly dropped.”   It’s nearly a 50 percent drop, which the food bank attributes directly to the COVID-19 pandemic.   “If you look at it, everybody goes into the supermarket, you see what’s going on in the supermarket,” Condon said. “There’s less food on the shelves, and that means there’s less food that makes its way here to us at the food bank.”   Royal Farms has traditionally had a relationship with the Maryland Food Bank with smaller donations, but it recently dropped off a trailer full of about 20-thousand pounds.   “We’re hoping it finds its way to the hearts and stomachs of those who need it,” Breahna Brown, of Royal Farms, said.   It’s anticipated that more people will find themselves in need. On average across the state, there are approximately 1.3 million people who are food insecure at any given time.   “That number has started to go up about 25 percent,” Condon said. “And you see tens of thousands of people currently hitting the unemployment rolls. We have anticipation that number is going to grow even further.”   Given that fact, there’s hope for more donations.   “We encourage all our corporate neighbors to do the same,” Brown said. “It‘s definitely going to take a village to turn this thing around.”   Another shortage at the food bank is the number of volunteers.

(WJZ) —  Emily Freeman is a performer for Princess Cruise Lines.  The Bowie native boarded a ship on March 8 and hasn’t set foot on land since.   “Just being isolated in my 230 square foot cabin on a ship is fine, but its not a permanent solution,” Freeman said.   She said days later, the CDC ordered all passengers to disembark, but it didn’t have any guidelines for crew members.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     She’s currently quarantined on the Emerald Princess.   In her free time, Freeman has been taking TikTok videos in her cabin.   Emily’s mom, Nancy, has been in touch with Senator Ben Cardin, who is urging Princess Cruise Lines to act quickly so American citizens can get home.   “It’s more the unknown and not knowing and the rumors of them maybe going off around the world that is scary,” Nancy Freeman said.   Currently, the Coastguard is monitoring 120 cruise ships in U.S. waters with about 80,000 crew members   The reason why Freeman — and others — can’t disembark is because of a CDC order that prohibits cruise ship workers from staying in a hotel, using public transportation, taking a commercial airline flight or interacting with the public for 14 days upon arrival on shore, regardless of how long they’ve quarantined on board.   The CDC tells WJZ, in part:   “The CDC permits cruise ships to disembark their crew members if the cruise line signs an attestation stating that the cruise line has complied with all requirements for the safe disembarkation of the crew.”   The CDC said it has not received this information from Princess Cruise Lines for the Emerald Princess.   “I shouldn’t be forced to have to wait it out here,” Freeman said.   Freeman said that the captain on her ship provides an update every day at noon. While the information continues to change, Thursday’s update said that they would be able to go home sometime next week.   WJZ reached out to princess cruise lines and have yet to hear back.

The latest hope for the league is that they will be able to return some time in June, though full details are still being figured out.  Baseball Hall of Famer and Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. told  CBS News’ Major Garrett  that baseball wants to return for many reasons, one of which is to provide its fans something to think about outside of the current pandemic.   “I think the big thing is, they just want to get back and provide people with the chance to escape, or look at something in an entertaining sort of way,” said Ripken on  The Takeout  podcast . “It makes them feel good, it makes them feel comfortable.”   Ripken Jr. pointed to the way fans reacted when the sport came back in the wake of 9/11 as an example of how sports can provide an escape from the difficulties of every day life for its fans.   “When we came back to play, it was interesting the role that baseball played in giving comfort,” Ripken said. “I’m really happy that they’re looking for all ways in which to bring it back.”   How and when baseball returns is still up in the air, but Ripken Jr. feels that the game can be a help to fans who are struggling with the impacts of the current crisis.

(CBS Local)  — A man allegedly attacked at least four people with an ax inside a home improvement store in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on Wednesday, authorities said.  Witnesses told police a man walked into a Lowe’s store on Illinois Road and grabbed an ax, which was quickly taken away. The suspect then grabbed a second ax and began threatening the man who took away the first ax and another customer.   The suspect “was chasing both of us down the aisle telling us he was going to kill us and we’re the devil and we need to die, we’re not going to see anybody after this,” said Christina Mora, who was shopping in the store at the time.   Mora told  CBS affiliate WANE  after that, they ran to the front of the store where she and the taller man split up. The suspect followed the man but told Mora he was going to come after her later.     Four people injured after a man allegedly threatened people with axes at a Lowe's Home Improvement on Fort Wayne's west side. A woman who was shopping inside says what she felt while running away from him could only be described as sheer terror. https://t.co/qaOTk5p1Ha   — Britt Salay WANE 15 (@bsalaynews)  April 30, 2020     Lowe’s employees and some customers managed to get suspect on the ground shortly after and hold him there until hep arrived.   Four people received minor injuries during the incident. While Mora was not injured, she was shaken.   “I had already seen him swing and try to hit other employees and actually hit an employee so I knew he wasn’t just chasing people just threatening to do it,” she said. “This gentleman was actually trying to hurt people. I just thought I wasn’t going to make it home to my kids, I wasn’t going to see my family again, you know, how was anybody going to know what happened?”   Police took Joshua Kaleb Harless, 24, into custody and cleared out the store in case there were others involved, but they believe he acted alone.   Harless was charged with battery, criminal recklessness and aggravated battery.

Lindsey got into a devastating car accident when she was 17 years old in Louisiana and she was given a five percent chance to live and a one percent chance to walk. Lindsey ended up being bedridden for seven years, battled issues with chronic pain, and became dependent on prescription painkillers. All of these stories are featured in Lindsey’s memoir for Simon & Schuster called “ There I Am: The Journey from Hopelessness to Healing .” Lindsey’s story of perseverance is unlike anything you’ve ever heard or read before and the process of writing her story was extremely difficult.   “When you’re writing a memoir, you are going back in and re-traumatizing yourself,” said Lindsey in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “I had to go through my wreck, being in my bed for seven years, finding out about the wire in my brain stem, and burying my dad, and going through my divorce. It was really painful and really hard, but in the same breath it became this invitation for me to do the deepest healing work I’ve ever done. I don’t think I would’ve gone in so deeply, if it wasn’t such a nightmare.   FULL INTERVIEW:   As a result of her experience, Lindsey is now a renowned speaker and activist who travels around the country to tell her story. The author said she was properly able to mourn the death of her father while writing her book and learned a lot about herself that she hadn’t focused on before.   “I had a complete nervous breakdown about seven and a half years ago, which I now call my breakthrough. My marriage had ended, my dad passed away and there had been so much loss and so much trauma. I stopped sleeping, I had to move home, and I couldn’t take care of myself. My family was going to send me away to get help because I was not okay. I started weening myself off the drugs the next day. I had to relearn how to live. I felt like my brain started to come back. In order to feel the beautiful good, you have to experience the loss. I thought I was broken. We are not broken, we are traumatized and the beautiful thing is we can heal from that.”   Lindsey’s book is available now wherever books are sold.

I became a homeless teenager in northern Virginia,” he said. “Living on the streets my entire senior year of high school.”   He said right now, another major problem for children is abuse that’s going unnoticed because they’re not in school, and teachers who would normally notice signs of abuse, are not able to report it.   “We’re going to start seeing the numbers of abuse that they’ve already seen that in local hospitals of kids coming in with severe abuse,” Scheer said.   Others are aging out of the system without a place to go.   “Go to a shelter? Where there’s 60, 70, 90, 100 people. We know we’re supposed to be social distancing, but no one’s talking about these kids,” Scheer said.   He added that right now, more than anything, these children are wanted and loved.   “We want children knowing we love them,” Scheer said.   To  donate to Schaffer’s non-profit, click right here .

(WJZ) —  More than 37,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment last week.  According to new numbers released Thursday, 37,225 residents filed with the state’s Department of Labor.   The number dropped nearly 10,000 from the previous week when more than 47,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment insurance.     Maryland unemployment claims out this morning dropped slightly from the week before. 37,225 filed last week. Here in the breakdown by location ⬇️  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/TJT9chDK1L   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  April 30, 2020     According to CBS News, another  3.8 million Americans filed for unemployment  last week.   Some Marylanders who previously obtained unemployment benefits have suddenly stopped receiving checks.   “On unemployment, I’d probably give them a ‘D,’” Judy Kilgore told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren when asked to grade the state. “I’ve worked my whole life since I was 13, and I’ve always taken care of my family and paid my bills, and it’s very frustrating.”   Judy Kilgore with her grandsons   Kilgore said she got one check in April after filing in March and more money never came.   She waited for hours to log on to the state’s problematic new Beacon unemployment website.   “You just keep trying. That’s the only thing you can do until you get the answers that you need,” Kilgore said.   A screenshot of Kilgore’s wait time   Kilgore is busy helping home school her grandkids and worried about what she’ll do to make ends meet.   Despite making dozens of calls, she has yet to get answers from a human being at the Department of Labor.   “I’ve made more than 700 phone calls in the last three days to the unemployment office. I can’t get through to anybody,” Kilgore said.   Gov. Larry Hogan apologized Wednesday to Marylanders trying to file for unemployment through the state’s new BEACON portal.   “I want to take just a moment to personally address every Marylander who has had difficulty dealing with the serious problems on the state unemployment insurance website,” Hogan said during a press conference. “With all of the economic struggles that people are already going through, they should not have to worry about getting the resources that they need and that they deserve.”   The BEACON portal launched nearly a week ago and is supposed to be a one-stop-shop for Marylanders who are eligible for benefits to apply. But some residents say they have been struggling to file online, sometimes being put in a queue of users or the site crashing when they try to apply.   “The system keeps crashing,” Janice Moore told WJZ.   “It knocked me off, I was back to server error,” Kathy Poole said.   Hogan said more than 245,000 accounts have been activated since the launch and more than 100,000 new claims were filed.   “While we have been able to handle this volume better than many other states in the country. It is simply not good enough,” Hogan added. “The IT contractor who developed this site, and the Department of Labor, have fallen short of the high standards that we have set and the people of Maryland deserve better and the buck stops with me.”   “So I am going to make sure that they do and that we do whatever it takes to get this straight. Every single Marylander gets every single penny financial assistance that they deserve,” he said.

The petition reads in part:   “We acknowledge the tragedy caused by COVID-19 and appreciate that it is a significant public health concern. However, the economic, social and educational disruption caused by shutdowns is guaranteed to cause significant, even greater, harm, leading to increased deaths, economic disruption, loss of livelihood, and educational challenges for Marylanders and their families, and far less disruptive means of managing the disease can be employed.”   “The businesses, the businesses they just got to open, and if they only let five (people) in at a time or whatever, they want people to stay safe and they want their employees to stay safe,” protester Katrina Venuto, a nurse, said.   Restrictions like those should be made at a smaller scale and not by the state government, she said.   “It’s so sad to see all these small businesses being shuttered and I think it’s a decision for a personal business if they can open safely or not,” she said.   The governor has said the number of cases in the state is still rising and the state is not quite ready to reopen just yet.   A spokesperson for Hogan said the event was peaceful and no arrests were made despite the governor’s order prohibiting large gatherings.     The Maryland Capitol Police worked alongside various police agencies to provide traffic control and ensure an orderly demonstration at today’s rally in Annapolis. The demonstration was peaceful and there were no arrests.

The legal drama stars Simone Missick and the show focuses on the flawed legal process and how Judge Lola Carmichael wants to immediately change things in Los Angeles. Missick was blown away at how everyone was able to pull of the production of a virtual episode.   “We shut down production on March 13 and for safety reasons, we were all happy that we were taking that precaution,” said Missick in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “We were all checking in like we always do and we got a message from one of our executive producers saying Greg [Spottiswood] has a pitch for an episode. Greg reads us a 10 minute treatment and we thought this is amazing. Then we were like wait, how do we do this. Shortly thereafter, CBS approved it and the next day we did a table read and a tech scout in our houses. They started sending over lights and props and then we started shooting. It was six days to shoot a 62 page episode. Normally it’s seven and a half days to shoot a 60 page episode. It was exhausting covering 12 different jobs in addition to acting.”   Missick was really proud of what the show pulled off when she watched the episode. The actor is thankful “All Rise” got a proper season finale and an opportunity to say thank you to the fans. While Missick has been on big shows like “Luke Cage” and “Altered Carbon,” “All Rise” has been a really important experience for her.   “Our courtroom scenes felt like us. It really felt like the way it feels when we’re on set,” said Missick. “I’m really proud of what we pulled off. I keep getting these great gifts of making history. The first gift was being the first African-American female to lead a show on CBS. Just when you think the first season is done, then we make history as the first scripted drama series to do a virtual episode.”   Stream season one of “ All Rise ” on CBS All Access.

LeBron James, Bad Bunny, Charli D’Amelio, Dixie D’Amelio, Chika, YBN Cordae, Loren Gray, H.E.R., the Jonas Brothers, Brandan Bmike Odums, Ben Platt, Henry Platt, Jonah Platt, Megan Rapinoe, Yara Shahidi, Lena Waithe, Pharrell Williams, Malala Yousafzai, and many more will participate in #GraduateTogether.  As coronavirus has prompted the cancellation of high school graduation ceremonies, some of the nation’s biggest media companies will honor the more than 3 million high school seniors across the country with a joyful tribute to the Class of 2020. CBS, ABC, FOX, and NBC will simultaneously air the special along with leading entertainment, social media and streaming platforms—including Complex Networks, Facebook App, Instagram, PeopleTV, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube—which will all create dynamic experiences for each of their unique audiences.   “We learned early on in our work with students and families in Akron that education is so much more than academics. It’s about a shared experience, a journey we’re all on together—students, parents, educators, community members, and everyone around them. With that not being possible right now, we’ve been working to find ways to help families get through this really difficult time,” said LeBron James. “These students have worked incredibly hard for this and there’s no way we can let that go unrecognized. While this won’t be the graduation experience they were supposed to get, we hope we can still give them something special because they deserve it.”   Curated by high school students and educators throughout the country, with the support of the American Federation of Teachers, this national commercial-free broadcast will include a collection of commencement addresses, celebrity performances, and inspirational vignettes. #GraduateTogether is inviting students, educators, and families to submit their own videos and photos online for consideration to be included in the telecast. In addition, renowned artist JR and his global participatory art project, Inside Out, will invite high school students everywhere to share their portraits in celebration of being part of the graduating Class of 2020. And because high school graduations are local, local television stations will also feature custom breakaways to celebrate the achievements of high school students in their own communities.   This crisis has created a critical void across the nation’s most underserved and challenged communities. Schools play a vital role in every neighborhood and are often the source of stability in a young person’s life, providing education, meals, and a place to stay safe. Led by Entertainment Industry Foundation, The LeBron James Family Foundation and its I PROMISE School, and XQ Institute, #GraduateTogether is partnering with  DonorsChoose  and  America’s Food Fund  to help fill this void. DonorsChoose gives public school teachers working in high-need communities the opportunity to request the materials and resources their students need to keep learning. America’s Food Fund provides funding to hunger-relief organizations, ensuring students who rely on school-lunch programs still have safe, consistent access to meals during COVID-19.   “‘We miss you’—that’s what I hear America’s educators telling their students over and over again,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “Our country’s teachers and support personnel have been on the front lines keeping students engaged, comforted, and supported during this time of incredible upheaval. Educators want their kids to be okay. And even if we are physically apart, we are eager to celebrate our students’ accomplishments alongside parents, family members, and caregivers as we try to bring this school year to a meaningful close. We are grateful to all our teachers and school staff and proud to join in this effort to bring together education professionals from across the country and honor graduates as they embark on their next journey.”   Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020  will be broadcast commercial-free on Saturday, May 16, 2020, at 8:00 PM ET/PT, 7:00 PM CT on ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC.

But now more than ever, during the COVID-19 pandemic, their support is needed the most.   “There’s a lot of struggles already happening in that community,” Callahan said. “But they’ve been so resilient, our families. They’ve had to adapt to teaching their children and having them at their house every day, all day.”   The non-profit organization is still holding to their promise, offering resources and support for children and families in need through zoom meetings.   “With these groups, we built a community and we’re able to help out one another,” Vonzella Parker said. “If there may be something about food, someone may need food or certain things”   Parker is a mother of four and said its so important now to let other families know they’re not alone.   “It’s awesome that we can get our points across to help one another still, even though we are social distancing,” Parker said.   Resources are also provided on Facebook for things like childcare supplies, food and even video lessons for children.

MW:  Hey there Donnie, hope all’s going well for you during quarantine, s uper excited to talk to you today . H ave you been doing anything special to keep busy during this time ?     DW:  You know, t he first few days I was dealing with  one business catastrophe after another .   M y family’s in the restaurant business and w e’ re shutting down restaurants left and right and dealing with a lot of fallout from that . I t’s kind of weighing on me a little bit and I just kind of went on Instagram Live and clicked on  C lub  Qua r a ntin e  with  D-N ice one afternoon and t he music just made me feel a lot better and reminded me of who I am .     I ‘m not a person who gets stressed out or gets down . I  a lways put other people before myself .   T hat little musical experience kind  of  reminded me to get back to who I am .   I  immediately  wrote a song ,  called “ H ouse  P arty” which I recorded with  N ew  K ids On The  B lock ,  B oyz  2  M en and Naughty B y  Nature and  B ig  Freedia ,  Jordin Sparks .  The song’s  raised almost a quarter  million dollars   for  charity .     Jenny and I’ve been doing a lot of fun videos just to keep people smiling and laughing .   D oing our part in this time to help other people in any way we can .  I mean  we’re entertainers,  so we’re just trying to entertain and do it in a way that’s helpful to others .     MW:   M usic alone is such a great way to lift people’s spirits but the charity aspect adds a whole other dimension to it ,  really cool .     DW:   T hank you .  I couldn’t believe we actually pulled this all off ,  work ing  with all these other artists .   W e had to ship microphones around the country ,  but  I  made a point when I wrote the song to reach out to friends .  I didn’t want a big celebrity song full of people that I don’t even know just  be cause they’re famous .   I t’s people that we have relationships with ;  people we have a connection with .   M y brother ’ s in the video .   I t really is something that was from the heart and people who we have a connection with want to be part of  it. I’m  grateful to them for doing it .       MW:  Outside of music you also  have an episode of  Blue B loods  coming this week .  I’m curious though ,  this is the season finale ,  was that the plan or was that altered because of everything ?     DW:   I t was not the plan .   W e had three episodes to go after this one ,  but ironically this episode is probably the most appropriate season finale we’ve ever had .   I t’s probably the best season f i n ale  we’ve ever had .   I t’s  huge twist s  that turns the Reagan family upside down .   V ery  heart felt  and interesting to say the least  be cause it really is going to propel the show into next season .  I can’t wait to hear what the audience has to say about it .     MW:  Y ou mentioned the Reagan family ,  and a big thing for you guys is the big family dinner .   W hat do you think the Reagan family would be doing during this time ?  They are f irst responders so how woul this  r eal-life  situation effect them ?     DW:  I don’t think the  R eagans would be getting together for dinner .   T hey’d probably be exposed to a lot of people because they’d still be up there on the front lines ,  doing what so many brave men and women are doing right now   in the real world .   R eal life first responders are out there putting themselves on the line and I’d like to think the  Reagans  would be doing the same and they probably have to skip some Sunday dinners for everyone safety and for grandpa’s safety .     One  of the great things about working on  Blue Bloods  is seeing just how courageous so many men and women are when it comes to first responders .  I think in times of crisis like this we  see  and we appreciate what they do .   B ut it would be nice if we could come through this crisis with that same appreciation .   Not just first responders but  doctors ,  nurses ,  teachers you name it .  I mean there’s so many people  that  have shown their value and how critical they are to our society functioning .   I n people being safe and educated and taken care of .  I hope that somehow one of the small takeaways from this is the big ,  b ig  sacrifices so many people make for all of us .       MW:  R ight it feels like when these events happen there’s always a big push to say thank you and to appreciate them .   T hen six months goes by and  it  kind of fades a little bit and hopefully that’s something that can stick around .       DW:  Yeah it doesn’t have to be a lot. Just a dinner, h avin g  dinner with your loved ones .   W e grew up with our family members from the day we ’ re born .   T h ey’re  in our lives and we think you’re always going to be there and one day it’s taken away from us .   I t reminds us of how precious and fragile life is .   T he key though is to move forward and not forget that like we so often do .   H opefully we won’t this time .     MW:   The   R eagans wouldn’t be able to sit together ,  but I believe you and your  castmates  actually did have a  Z oom dinner al l  together ,  is that right ?  how’d that go ?     DW:  We did. We didn’t really  eat dinner ,  but we got the crew together for a virtual gathering .  I just got the idea from doing so much outreach to fans in my world of my band and stuff . S taying connected with them ,  I thought ,  what better thing to do than get the  R eagans together virtually?   A   Z oom conference is perfectly set up for a Reagan family virtual dinner ,  so we did it .     I t was great and it’s great for the fans of the show .   I t was great for us as actors we got the season cut  short,   so  we didn’t get to say goodbye to each other .   I t was a great way to check in and re-connect .  We also  celebrated Bridget  M oynahan’s  birthday which we never get to do because the shows always finish shooting by the time her birthday rolls so that was  great.     MW:  Very nice and a belated happy birthday to Bridget! L ast question before I let you go here ,  so as we kind of touched on a little bit before  Blue Blood’ s  new episode this week is the season finale .  What does it mean to you be able to provide people with an escape when they tune in for this week’s episode Friday night?

The Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont face the same challenges in their own unique way. A look at some of the obstacles for the Preakness:   RACE DATE   The 145th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course was set for May 16, but has been postponed to a date yet to be determined. The Stronach Group, which owns Pimlico, said it was working with state and local governments and other stakeholders “to determine the most appropriate time.” The Preakness is usually held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, which has been rescheduled to Sept. 5. If the Belmont was held three weeks after the Preakness, that would leave the horses and trainers little time before the Breeder’s Cup in November. Linda Gaudet, a trainer and charter member of the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association, sa she thinks the two options for the Preakness are around July 4 or after the Derby. Holding the Preakness before the Derby would break tradition, but Gaudet asked: “Why not be the first jewel of the Triple Crown this year?”   RACE LOCATION   Pimlico officials canceled Infieldfest 2020, thereby closing the infield to fans, so the race might move to nearby Laurel Park. Maryland law states the Preakness can be moved from Pimlico “only as a result of a disaster or emergency.” Gaudet said: “If and when we start running and open back up for racing in Maryland, I am sure it will be at Laurel. But if we had to go to Pimlico for a weekend or a week, I’m sure it can happen.”   NO FANS?   The crowd at Pimilco for the Preakness usually exceeds 100,000, a figure that won’t be reached without the thousands that gather in the infield. But if social distancing is still part of the culture, the only sounds at Old Hilltop during the race might be the pounding of hooves on dirt.   “I’m not very optimistic it will be run in front of the fans unless it’s way late in the fall and everything is good and everybody is healthy,” Gaudet said.   BETTORS   The handle on Preakness day last year was a record $99,852,653. If the race is run without fans in the stands, the only wagers will be placed at off-track sites. If the Preakness is run before the Derby or more than two weeks after, it could be a better wagering race because more top-quality horses are entered. In the unlikely event it moves to Laurel, BRISnet’s Ed DeRosa said the change of track would alter the race as much as the calendar because of a different configuration and perhaps give Maryland bettors a “home-track advantage.”   ___   AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.

(WJZ) —  The officer shot in Parkville Thursday was injured by friendly fire, according to police.  Police Officer First Class T. Hays, a 13-year-veteran of the force, remains in stable condition at Shock Trauma after she was shot in the upper body.   Female Baltimore County Police Officer Shot While Responding To Call About Armed Man, Suspect Dead   Police initially thought the suspect fired at the officers, but after reviewing body camera footage they believe the man picked up his gun and pointed it at officers and did not follow officers’ commands to put down the weapon.   The suspect in Thursday’s shooting was identified as 76-year-old Robert Uhl Johnson. Johnson died as a result of the shooting.   Johnson called 911 and reported an unknown armed man was inside the home in the 3000 block of Linwood Avenue, police said. The suspect then hung up on the 911 dispatcher as she tried to get more information. 911 called back the home multiple times with no answer — finally dispatching officers to the scene.   “He called in a very calm demeanor and said that somebody was inside his house with a gun,” Baltimore County Police Corporal Shawn Vinson said.   When officers arrived around 1:37 p.m. they saw Johnson inside seated and facing the front door. One officer tried to engage with the suspect, but he refused to get up from his chair or leave the home.   Officers then got inside the home and directed Johnson to put his hands up. But Johnson didn’t listen, instead of grabbing his gun and said, “I’m sorry I have to do this.”   “It’s very clear on there, in audio, that he says, ‘I am sorry I have to do this,’ and lifts the handgun,” Vinson said.   Four officers fired their weapons at Johnson.   After investigating they learned Johnson’s gun was not loaded. He left his will and last request for burial out for officers to find. Police say that indicated this could be a “suicide by cop.”   Hays is currently assigned to the Parkville precinct and was involved in another police-involved shooting in 2008.   The three other officers involved in the shooting were also identified as:     Police Officer First Class J. Hummel, an 18 year veteran with no prior police-involved shootings.   Police Officer First Class A. Burns, a 17 ½ year veteran with no prior police-involved shootings.   Police Officer First Class J.

Instead of kicking off the chase this weekend with the Kentucky Derby, the storied race may end up capping the trio of races on Labor Day weekend.   Instead of 3-year-old colts saving the longest race for last, maybe they begin in New York with a shortened Belmont Stakes in late May or June. Or perhaps the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico will be run on a sweltering July afternoon.   It could happen.   All scenarios are on the table, with talks ongoing among the host tracks and broadcaster NBC. Government and public health officials weighing in on health and safety concerns involving the coronavirus pandemic figure heavily, too.   The heavyweight of the group, Churchill Downs, announced in March it was moving the Derby to Sept. 5 because of the coronavirus that has halted live racing at some major tracks. It’s the first time since 1945, when it was run in June, that the Derby won’t go off on the first Saturday in May.   And if it comes to it, the track has no problem bringing up the rear in the Triple Crown series.   “We’re totally fine with it,” said Darren Rogers, senior director of communications for Churchill Downs.   Especially if the same horse wins the first two legs to set up a Triple Crown bid when the Derby rolls around.   “However it shakes down, this is a very unique year,” Rogers said. “We’ve all had to make some very difficult, but necessary, decisions. That’s not unique to Churchill; that’s us as a society in general.”   There is precedent for the Derby, Preakness and Belmont to be held out of order. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby 11 times. In 1917 and 1922, the Derby and Preakness were run on the same day in May.   Starting in 1930, the term Triple Crown became popular in referring to the three races and since 1931, the Derby, Preakness and Belmont have been run in that order.   The Maryland Jockey Club and New York Racing Association have yet to announce new dates for the Preakness and Belmont. The 1 3/16-mile Preakness is scheduled for May 16, which would have been two weeks after the 1 1/4-mile Derby’s original Saturday date. The 1 1/2-mile Belmont is set for June 6, its usual spot five weeks after the Derby’s original date.   “If you go from a mile-and-a-half and start dropping back, it’s going to change a lot,” said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, winner of 14 Triple Crown races. “It’ll change how you train, it’ll change the type of horse that will end up in the Derby. It’ll be a very, very significant change.”   There also is the prospect of not having over 150,000 behatted, well-dressed, mint julep-sipping fans at the Derby, the raucous infield crowd at the Preakness or a busy grandstand at the Belmont.   NYRA is seeking to restore live racing now at Belmont Park and later Saratoga, whose meet opens in July. Its plan includes no spectators, additional health and safety precautions, and only essential employees at the track. Churchill Downs has received clearance to resume live racing without fans on May 16.   The pandemic has also upended the Road to the Kentucky Derby, creating challenges for the series of prep races that determines who is in the race. Points are awarded to the top four finishers and the top 18 finishers on the leaderboard earn spots in the starting gate for the Derby. Two spots are reserved for the top points earners from Europe and Japan.   A revised schedule of prep races isn’t expected until the Preakness and Belmont dates are re-set, and live racing returns in Maryland, New York and California.   Churchill Downs has said horses that earned points before the remaining schedule was thrown into disarray by the pandemic will keep them. Florida Derby winner Tiz the Law leads the standings with 122 points.   Reorganizing the prep races and the Triple Crown series will require cooperation among tracks that are used to going their own way in a sport lacking centralized oversight.   “We’ve had conversations with a number of racetracks about potentially hosting a Road to the Kentucky Derby qualifying race,” Rogers said. “As soon as the races are finalized and racetracks are back up and running, we’ll make that announcement.”   It’s one that owners and trainers anxiously await.   “It’s hard when you have horses ready to run and you don’t have a game plan on where to run them,” said Liz Crow, a racing manager and bloodstock agent.   If the Triple Crown begins with the Derby in September, trainers may decide to rest their top contenders. However, sticking with the traditional timing of the series would mean it ends just a month before the Breeders’ Cup, set for Nov. 6-7 at Keeneland. That would leave horses little time to regroup for the lucrative world championships.   Some horses could benefit from all the changes, others hurt by it. The Triple Crown is restricted to 3-year-olds, giving horses only one chance to run in it.   “There is going to be some horses that go by the wayside,” trainer Mark Casse said. “Then there’s going to be some coming on that, if we had ran the Derby the first Saturday in May, they would’ve never had any chance.”   However it plays out, the Derby’s traditional May date won’t pass unnoticed.   Churchill Downs and NBC will mark the occasion with three hours of coverage on Saturday, including re-airing American Pharoah’s Derby win in 2015, which launched the colt on a path to becoming the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years.   Also on tap is the track’s first virtual horse race between the 13 past Triple Crown winners — from Sir Barton in 1919 to Justify in 2018 — with Larry Collmus calling the race.   “It’s so crazy,” said Jack Wolf of Starlight Racing, co-owner of Derby contender Charlatan. “Nobody really knows where we stand with all this.”   ___   AP Sports Writers David Ginsburg in Baltimore, Gary B.

Andy Harris, told Newsmax earlier this week that some rural parts of the state should be able to reopen.    “The problem is the governor is treating the state as one homogeneous state, but it’s not. It actually has rural areas where the prevalence of the disease is quite low,” he said.   Neighboring Pennsylvania announced Friday that 24 rural counties would begin reopening  on May 8 .   Hogan said on April 20 that he did not want to reopen the state piecemeal fearing people would flock to those areas if he relaxed orders.

The Aerial Investigation Plane system will provide surveillance of 90 percent of the city over a maximum period of 180 days, focusing on murders, non-fatal shootings, armed robberies and car-jackings. Three planes will fly over the city as a test to see if they can help cut down on violence.   Baltimore City leaders said the program is intended to reduce crime, but the ACLU and others consider it an invasive and potentially unconstitutional invasion of privacy.   On Friday, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison again touted the program as another tool to fight crime in the city.   “From the very beginning I said this and I say this now: there really is no expectation because this is a pilot program, and because there was some skepticism in the beginning, we’re using this pilot to tell us what this will or will not do,” he said.   The ACLU had asked for a temporary restraining order against the program which a district court judge denied. The organization is appealing the court’s decision.   “We believe (it) is an unconstitutional program that will track the movements of every single person in Baltimore every single time they walk out their door,” said David Rocah with the Maryland ACLU.   Police said data will only be used for purposes related to criminal investigations.   “The goal is to be able to track where an individual may have gone after a crime of violence is committed or where a person may have come from leading up to the location of the crime of violence,” Harrison said. “So what we’re doing now is giving detectives a tool to tie into the other technologies we have to use.   Harrison added detectives who request the information will get a packet with information related only to the specific incident being investigated.   The program will be reviewed by independent civilian auditors to “ensure that the program is only being used for its intended purpose.”   Residents like Dayvon Love, a plaintiff in the suit against the city, are concerned there is no guarantee that information won’t be misused since the system is owned by a private company.   “I would pressure all the candidates for mayor, I would pressure all of them to make commitments that they will not extend this program, that they would shut it down as soon as they take office,” Love said.   The technology was secretly tested in Baltimore in 2016. Residents and top city officials were unaware of the police-approved test until the media revealed it, sparking a years-long debate over its use.   Baltimore Police Aerial Investigation Pilot Program Launches Friday   Harrison announced the new pilot program in December 2019.

(WJZ) —  A group protesting Maryland’s business closures during the coronavirus pandemic has organized another rally for Saturday, May 2, this time starting in Frederick and ending in Salisbury.  Reopen Maryland is planning a “road rally” across the state  to protest Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay at home order. They want the governor to reopen the state so that people can get back to work.   “There is no evidence base for stay-home orders. We have not received transparent information about data underlying decisions. Nor has the Governor demonstrated sympathy to his constituents or justified his oppressive measures. This is why we are protesting,” the group posted to its Facebook page.   The group says Gov. Hogan exaggerated numbers when he said Maryland could end up being like New York with the number of cases.   “Claims used to justify restrictive measures, such as the Governor’s statement that we would look “a lot more like New York” by Easter, have been shown to be highly exaggerated,” the group posted. “New cases and new deaths have been trending down for days in Maryland. States such as Georgia, with more cases, more deaths, and fewer tests completed, have announced plans to open for business as of May 1.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     The in-vehicle rally will begin around 10 a.m. at the Frederick Scott Key Mall and then the group will travel along I-70 East to 695 to 97 to 50 and cross the Bay Bridge then down to Salisbury.   They are making a lunch stop along Kent Island.   Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) is expected to speak at the rally’s closure at The Centre at Salisbury around 2:30 p.m.   The  group previously demonstrated in Annapolis  on April 18, where most protesters stayed inside their vehicle and followed social distancing rules.     They wanted the state to reopen on May 1. The group says it represents more than 20,000 Marylanders.

Despite a lung condition, the 72-year-old in Aurora, Colorado, needed to get her paycheck, according to her sister, Paula Spellman. Her husband, Gus, was injured and out of work, and the couple had bills due.   Kunz died on April 20  from complications related to the coronavirus, her sister said. Gus, who was also sick from the virus, died two days before his wife.   While it is unclear how the couple contracted the virus, Spellman said her sister had expressed concerns about customers at Walmart coughing on her at the cash register.   “I wish she didn’t work there. I wish she had taken leave,” Spellman said. “I get angry because she should have been more protected.”   Walmart says it has instituted several safety measures in its stores , including here in Maryland, providing masks and erecting sneeze guards, or plexiglass barriers, to protect its workers from the coronavirus.   The cash register has emerged as the most dangerous place in the store, according to public health and worker safety experts. Every item cashiers touch, scan and bag has been handled by customers and other workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  says  it is possible that a person can get coronavirus by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it.   The job also entails being at arm’s length from customers all day rather than the CDC-recommended six feet, making socially distancing nearly impossible, these experts said. The risks for shoppers are heightened as they move toward the register, too. If a cashier is infected, the employee could spread it to customers.   “The cashier spot is still the most dangerous since every customer passes this area and stands there for some time while groceries are moving down the counter,” said Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Riverside.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     ‘Most exposure’   The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if they do not display symptoms, according to the CDC.   “Workers at the greatest risk are the workers with the most direct contact with other people,” said Brian Brown-Cashdollar, program director at the Western New York Council on Occupational Safety and Health, a worker safety advocacy group. Cashiers “have the most exposure.”   Spellman says that her sister expressed concerns to her about working behind the register without a mask. Walmart says it made masks available for workers in late March, including in Kunz’s store, and began requiring workers to wear them on April 20.   A spokesperson for Walmart said, “Our hearts go out to Sandy Kunz and her loved ones. Her loss shows the devastating impact of the COVID-19 virus.”   Walmart added that, in addition to offering masks to employees, the store had taken other measures earlier in March, such as adding social distancing markers and cleaning checkout lanes and cash registers more frequently. The store installed sneeze guards and began limiting the number of customers inside the store earlier in April.   Retailers have been stepping up their safety measures as the CDC’s guidance on the virus evolves. In addition to Walmart, Target, Kroger, Whole Foods and others have installed sneeze guards at checkout lanes and added social distancing markers in lines. Retailers are limiting the number of customers inside the store at a time and are sanitizing checkout stations frequently. Companies are also expanding the use of contact-free payment options so customers don’t have to touch screens or enter their pins.   Some public health experts and labor advocates believe the measures are not stringent enough to protect cashiers, other employees and customers. For instance, major retailers like Kroger, Target and Whole Foods are not mandating that customers wear masks, except in states and cities where they are required. And workers complain that the requirements are often not enforced.   Sneeze guards and self-checkout   While the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration says stores should consider opening up every other cash register to keep workers safe, this is not a requirement and many stores are not taking this measure, said John Grant, president of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers in California, which represents 20,000 grocery workers. Around 27% of the workers at the local who have gotten sick from the virus have been cashiers, Grant said.   Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, said cashiers “need N95 masks as much as health care workers.” He believes that all stores also need to give their cashiers face shields because many coronavirus carriers are asymptomatic. In China, stores are sanitizing cash, and the United States “should as well at some point.”   Cashiers also say limits on the number of customers inside stores are unevenly enforced and it’s hard to keep customers separated in lines. At Kunz’s Walmart in Aurora, for example, the local public health department briefly ordered the store to shut down in part because of complaints of “lack of social distancing” and “too many people in the store at one time.” The department has since allowed the store to reopen and said it has “good safety and health measures in place.”   The plexiglass barriers companies have put up are of limited help, some cashiers say, because customers lean over or around the barriers to talk to them.   “It doesn’t cover us properly,” said one Target cashier in Louisiana affiliated with the workers’ advocacy group Target Workers Unite who requested anonymity out of concern of retaliation. “There’s a considerable gap in the plexiglass on each register.”   A representative for Target declined to comment on the plexiglass but said “we have introduced dozens of new safety measures at our stores,” including reminding customers through loud speakers to observe social distancing rules.   “In any situation, if a team member feels uneasy about performing a specific task, we’d encourage them to have a conversation with their leader to determine if there are alternative tasks they could perform,” the retailer said.   Companies have expanded the use of self-checkout in recent years, but this also brings risks. “Self-checkout may make physical distancing a challenge because of the frequent need for customer assistance,” California’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration  says  in guidelines.   Workers have to clean down stations after each customer, retail employees say, and handling alcohol purchases is especially challenging. That’s because a worker has to come over to ask the customer for ID, the customer has to remove a mask, and then the worker has to check to make sure they match.   There are other concerns: “At self-checkout, guests tend to crowd you when they need help, even with social distancing reminders,” said a Target worker in North Carolina who is behind the cash register part time and also helps with self-checkout. This employee spoke under the condition of anonymity. Target declined to comment.   The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.

Even before the new site launched  a week ago Friday , Marylanders reported spending hours on the phone with no answer on the other end of the line.   The new Beacon One-Stop application was supposed to alleviate some of the long lines, but due to high volume, it crashed within hours of launching. Since then, the state has added a virtual waiting line for unemployment seekers.

Some Marylanders, including Towson University student Breia Lyons, say they’re still having problems and the fixes aren’t enough.   “It was just a robot asking me, ‘Oh what do you need help with?'” Lyons said.   Since its launch, the Beacon One-Stop application has seen more than 286,000 accounts created, 142,000 new claims submitted and 360,000 weekly claim certificates filed.   Gov. Larry Hogan has repeatedly apologized to those frustrated with the process, saying Wednesday “the buck stops” with him.   Still, Lyons is struggling to pay her bills. She lives with her disabled mother and spends hours on the site and making calls, hoping she’ll eventually get through to a person and get the money to pay her bills and buy groceries.   “I’m frustrated, I’m irritated, I don’t know what else I can do,” she said.   WJZ reached out to the Department of Labor about the concerns people have expressed in recent days; so far, they have not responded. In the past, the department said it’s been working around-the-clock to address problems with the website.

In total, a dozen aircraft will fly over the city.   “You’ll see two delta formations is what we call it,” Brewer said.   Brewer hopes their tribute to those helping patients battle COVID-19 will put a smile on peoples’ faces.   “It’s not just us saying thank you: it’s the thousands of other people that are going to look above and see us flying in support to all jointly with one voice say, ‘Thank you,'” he said.   Maryland State Police said residents in the areas will be able to see the flyover from their homes and social distancing guidelines will be in effect during this event.   People should not be traveling to landmarks, hospitals or gathering in large groups to see the flyover, America Strong said.   In a joint news release, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force squadrons reminded spectators to follow these safety guidelines.   “Residents in these areas will be able to see the flyover from the safety of their home-quarantine and should maintain all social distancing guidelines during this event,” the release said. “They should also refrain from traveling to landmarks, hospitals and gathering in large groups to view the flyover.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

When a group of nursing homes needed money to secure personnel protective equipment, a private citizen stepped up to help.   While hundreds of parking spaces sat empty in a Columbia business complex, one office was very busy.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “Our members need it desperately,” Kevin Hefner, of LifeSpan Network, said.   Cars loaded up on PPE gear that could save hundreds of lives.   “Nursing homes without masks or without gowns… without gloves, it’s a non-starter,” Hefner said.   LifeSpan is a network of about 300 senior living facilities in Maryland and Washington, D.C. Some have been hit hard with nearly half of the COVID-19 deaths in the state occurring at nursing homes and long-term care facilities.   When the network received nearly 200,000 masks this week, there was relief.   Finding the PPE was one thing, but coming up with the money on short notice was another, so Baltimore County Dr. Scott Rifkin fronted about $240,000.   “If you can get equipment into those buildings, you protect the patients,” Rifkin said. “In those buildings, you protect the staff in those buildings and you protect the community.”   An Owings Mills marketing company shifted its mission and located the large stockpile.   “We are working around the clock nationwide,” Scott Stein, of Strategic Factory, said. “We received an order in just yesterday from Hawaii. Everybody needs PPE, it’s a global issue.”   One shipment down and more to come.   “You can’t expect staff to come to work every day, put their lives in danger and not get the equipment,” Rifkin said.

One  new estimate  suggested that adults are spending more than 13 hours a day using screens, a spike up from 10 hours a day a year ago.   With children  cut off from physically attending school , they are more reliant on laptops and tablets for online lessons and entertainment.   And with our new routines likely to have a lot more screen time for the foreseeable future, experts say it’s important to learn how to protect our eyes from suffering as a result.   While there is no evidence of long-term eye damage from extended use of smartphones, computer screens or other devices, prolonged use can sometimes lead to blurred vision, eye fatigue, dry or irritated eyes and headaches, according to  Moorfield Eye Hospital  in London.   Dr. Raj Maturi, the clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a retina specialist, called these symptoms “digital vision syndrome.”   He, along with the doctors at the Moorfield Eye Hospital, recommended a 20-20-20 approach — for every 20 minutes spent at a screen you must take a break and look 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.   “When you are looking at a close target, your eyes are just training that one muscle at all time, and looking into the distance can relieve it,” he said.   Don’t forget to blink   While it’s close work, rather than screen use per se, that strains our eyes. Dr Maturi said that looking at bright devices can make us blink less, which leaves our eyes feeling dry.   “When things are bright, we blink less. It’s behavioral. So we can train ourselves to blink more often and blink fully,” he said.   If you’re already suffering from dry eyes, he recommended the use of artificial tears. Moorfields Eye Hospital also suggested using a humidifier, as well as making sure your work station is set up correctly.   The top of your computer screen should be in line with your eyes and about 18 to 30 inches from where you’re sitting and tilted back slightly, the hospital  said in a blog post  in April.   Dr. Rachel Bishop, a spokesperson for the National Eye Institute, agreed that where your screen is positioned is important.   “If you are looking down, then your eyelid is shut a bit and you’re not having as much evaporation — which can help prevent dry eyes. If you’re looking up high, your eye dries much quicker,” she said.   Other steps you can take include dimming the surrounding lights so that the screen is brighter in comparison and cleaning your computer screen regularly to avoid dust buildup, which can obscure the screen and cause eye irritation.   If you or your children continue to have vision problems after making these fixes, experts recommended seeking advice from an ophthalmologist or optician as it could be a sign of an uncorrected eye problem like long-sightedness or astigmatism.   If you’re older than your late 30s and unable to see an eye care professional because of lockdown restrictions, there would be no harm in buying a cheap pair of drugstore reading glasses and seeing if they help, said Bishop.   “The focusing muscle in your eye changes as you age. You can focus up close when you’re 20 for hours at a time and have no problems. But that ability declines as you age,” said Dr Bishop.   “For people who aren’t eager to have a medical appointment, the first thing is to try on some low-strength, over-the-counter reading glasses. Hold up something to read and pick the lowest number you can comfortably read at the distance you like to work,” she said.   Blue light   Another potential concern is the “blue light” that digital devices emit, but Dr. Maturi said this affects our body clock, rather than our vision. But it’s something worth paying attention to — especially for kids who can get overstimulated easily.   “When we go outside we look at a blue sky, that’s blue light,” he said. “The issue with blue light is at night. It can delay your ability to sleep quickly,” he said.   He suggested that people turn their devices to night mode or use e-readers with screens that more closely resemble a physical book. The key was to look at how many nits a display had — a measurement of luminance or brightness, he added.   To protect kids’ eyes, parents should encourage them to spend as much time outside as possible — within restrictions that are in place where you live to prevent the spread of Covid-19.   The past two decades have seen a massive increase  in myopia or short-sightedness among children  — and while scientists can’t agree on exactly what has caused this rise and whether there’s any link to screen use, they do know that spending time outdoors, especially in early childhood, can slow its progression.   “We should know more in a few years when research comes up with more answers, but for parents they have a dilemma because the school is now brought into the screen and kids social engagement are now brought into the screen and kids are playing their games on a screen,” said Bishop.

State, county, and city revenue has plummeted due to closures and costs related to COVID-19. It’s also affected the local economy and regional tourism as hotels, restaurants and other businesses have shut down.   “I was on the phone with [the Maryland delegation] early during this COVID-19 outbreak, and each one of them understood deeply, the potential damage to our cities and outcomes,” Young said.   Baltimore Mayor Jack Young Calls For President Trump To Give Stimulus Packages To Cities & States, Not Just Corporations   Young said the city relies heavily on tourism for revenue and the pandemic has really hurt that revenue source.   The U.S. Senate is reconvening this week and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said he will continue to advocate for Marylanders and it’s his top priority to help Baltimore city and other Maryland counties push forward after the virus.   “The federal government must step up, the health and welfare of the people of our state are directly involved in this, we’re gonna get through this,” Cardin said.   Most of the initial stimulus dollars were allotted directly for schools and to fight this virus, however, in order to recover, local leaders say they will need some more support. Also smaller municipalities, with less than 500,000 people, had to apply for the money and it’s a much more rigorous process to get the funds. So the delegation will ask for more flexibility and fight directly for municipalities so that they get some of the stimulus dollars.   Several cities and counties have said that if they don’t have the support they will have to make major cuts or layoff and furlough city workers, including some first responders, to make up the difference.   ‘Slap In The Face’ | Firefighters Union Says City Shouldn’t Be Discussing Layoffs, Furloughs During COVID-19 Pandemic   “[The] last thing that I ever want to do is lay off anyone because it adds to the stress that we’re facing here in Baltimore,” Young said.   Howard County Executive Calvin Ball and Montgomery County Executive Mark Erlich also joined the call to discuss what losses their counties are facing.

FULL OBIT: Winningest Head Coach In NFL History, Don Shula, Passes Away At 90   Born in Grand River, Ohio in 1930, football came naturally to Shula from a young age.   Shula would play 73 games over seven seasons in the NFL as a defensive back, finishing his career with 21 interceptions.   Shula played for the Colts from 1953 to 1956 as a defensive back. He also coached the Colts from 1963 to 1969. He was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997.   Despite plenty of success, Shula’s days in Baltimore seemed numbered after a stunning loss in Super Bowl III to Joe Namath and the New York Jets.  The Colts were heavy favorites heading into that game. Three years later, Shula would lead the Dolphins to Super Bowl VI.   Shula would remain Miami’s leader for the next 26 years, taking them to five Super Bowl appearances and winning back to back titles in 1972 and 1973.   In that ’72 season, Shula and the Dolphins became the only NFL team to complete a perfect season, finishing the year 17-0.  They remain the only team to complete an NFL season and win a Super Bowl without suffering a loss.   Shula retired in 1995 having coached more games than anyone in NFL history. He remains the all-time leader in wins with 347.

As crowds gathered in Baltimore’s Fells Point on Saturday, it made social distancing difficult if not impossible.   “It’s one of the things we’re concerned, as you see this happening around the country as states try to open in a safe way,” Gov. Hogan said.   Three Maryland delegates and several pastors and businesses have filed a lawsuit   The group wants the economy back open so people can return to work.   Again, the governor urges everyone to keep to social distancing and to only leave their homes for essential reasons.   Gov. Hogan spoke on Fox News on Sunday.   “We’re hoping to get our numbers to plateau so we can get things open as quickly as possible,” He added.

The actor became a star as Caroline Channing on “2 Broke Girls” with Kat Dennings and now plays Gemma on “The Neighborhood” with  Cedric the Entertainer ,  Max Greenfield , and  Tichina Arnold . While Behrs has already been on a hit TV show before, this CBS sitcom is in a category of its own.   “The Neighborhood has truly been one of the most magical experiences of my life,” said Behrs in an interview with CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith. “You’ve talked to the other people on this show and you know the level of talent on this show and also the heart of the people and how deeply we believe in the story we’re telling. It’s truly something I haven’t had in my career yet.”   Behrs has enjoyed many parts of her experience on “The Neighborhood,” but something she didn’t anticipate when starting the show was how much she was going to love watching Cedric the Entertainer perform in front of a live audience.   “Working with Cedric in front of a live audience, there’s such an element of you don’t know what he’s going to throw at you,” said Behrs. “As an actress who comes from the theater and loves that live feeling and electricity, I feel like working with Cedric has excited that theater-girl muscle in me. He’s so funny and unpredictable when we’re shooting in front of the audience.”     Like “The Neighborhood,” “2 Broke Girls” was a show that explored important topics through laughter. Behrs says comedy is a great entry point into larger societal conversations.   “Laughter is one of the most universal things that brings people together, maybe music as well,” said Behrs. “With laughter in particular, there’s a release that happens and a lot of times laughter comes out of a release of tragedy. 2 Broke Girls and The Neighborhood dealt with some issues that could be controversial in society that could break people apart, but the laughter brings them together.”   Two new episodes of “The Neighborhood” air back to back Monday night, starting at 8pm EST/PST.

His executive order, which forces closing some businesses and severely restricting how others operate, was set to expire May 8.   His order also bans gatherings of 10 or more in public or private.

Northam recently lifted a ban on elective surgeries and has said that his executive orders have been less restrictive than what some other states have issued.

Larry Hogan over two executive orders implemented statewide amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  State delegates Dan Cox, Neil Parrott and Warren Miller are among those suing Gov. Hogan over his stay-at-home order and order to only enter essential businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.   According to court documents , Del. Cox was set to speak at  Saturday’s Reopen Maryland Protest  and was allegedly threatened with arrest if he attended the rally in Frederick County.   Cox said in court documents that he was warned by a senior law enforcement official that the “’Governor has his sights on you’” and that if I attend, ride along and speak at the Reopen Rally, I would potentially be arrested because certain individuals had indicated they may stop cars “and arrest you.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     He then said he spoke with the Governor’s senior advisor Andrew Cassilly and Chief Counsel Mike Pedone who confirmed that if Del. Cox attends and speaks at the Reopen Rally he may be arrested.   Cox said he was then told he would be punished in accordance with the March 17 executive order, with an arrest for violating the executive order where a violator could face up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.   Cox addressed the lawsuit in a  Facebook post , it reads:   “Today, on behalf of thousands of Marylanders represented by 18 brave Plaintiffs, I regrettably had to file suit to seek to rein in the overreaching of the Governor’s Orders. As a Delegate I have fought hard in my Judiciary Committee for the Governor’s legislative policies, I’ve co-sponsored nearly all his legislation, and I even gave a Floor speech in defense of his budgetar y authority which the Left was taking away this Session. However, the line of freedom that the Supreme Court has explained is sacred to our American values and our natural liberty, has been crossed. On behalf of 22,000 Marylanders and millions who agree in this State, it’s past time Mr. Governor to lighten the heavy hand of your Executive Orders and stop picking winners and losers, and Reopen Maryland. Marylanders will not stand for continued house arrest and lock-downs and the destruction of our businesses and way of life.     We are smart enough to protect the elderly, those in nursing homes and those with vulnerable health conditions while also ensuring that the health and freedom of ALL Maryland is protected. This is not a partisan issue, this is our shared American way of life and we will keep it, so help us God.  Thank you to my colleagues who are standing with me, including Delegates unspoken and those who joined me in this suit, Delegate Warren Miller and Delegate Neil Parrott.”     The suit names the governor, Health Secretary Bobby Neall, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col Woodrow “Jerry” Jones and Deputy Health Secretary Fran Phillips as defendants.   Del. Parrott issued the following statement in a news release about his decision file the lawsuit:   “Threatening a legislator with arrest for exercising his first amendment right to free speech is not only unconstitutional, it is wrong. We live in a Republic, and I want to make sure that no one person in Maryland or in any other state of the nation should be able to have unchecked power. ”   Gov.

While Maryland’s response rate is above the national average, officials are urging those who have not responded, to do so.  The U.S. Census helps determine the distribution of resources across the country, and officials say it’s more important now, than ever.   “The numbers that we get, the data that we get, will inform the number of vaccines we may get, the number of hospital beds that are available,” said Robert McCord, Maryland Secretary of Planning. “Public health emergency services all are informed by census data.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     At just under 60 percent, Maryland’s response rate is above the national average of 56 percent. Due to COVID-19, the self-response phase has been extended until October 31.   “This is the first time in the history of the census that there are three ways to respond,” McCord said. “You can respond by online, you can respond by phone and you can respond when the form comes.”   The Baltimore City response rate currently sits at just under 46 percent below the national average, but according to Mayor Jack Young, they’re leading many of their peer cities.   “But some are gaining on us,” Mayor Young said. “So we need to maintain our focus to goal of 73 percent household response.”   The city has launched a dashboard to help track the response rate.   “I encourage all residents to use this tool to track their community census response,” Mayor Young added.   What’s on the table in Maryland? $16 billion in funding which will be distributed depending on the census.   $100,000 in grants has been distributed to 30 different minority owned businesses, churches and grass root organizations working to educate the public about the Census.

Marcellis Mosby started his Baltimore-based commercial and residential disinfecting service  Disinfect-it  in February.   “I had been doing a lot of research into COVID-19, looking into everything else that’s been going on around the world,” Mosby said. “I saw that it was going to come to the states and I wanted to be proactive.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     His service uses a technology known as ULV cold fogging to atomize a disinfecting liquid, allowing it to penetrate deep into surfaces and materials and kill bacteria and viruses like COVID-19.   “Everything that we use is safe for food contact, safe for pets, plants and safe for small children as well,” he said.   That’s good news for restaurants like Ekiben in Hampden, which added the service to their already thorough cleaning regiment as an extra layer of precaution.   “We know how to keep a kitchen clean,” co-owner Ephrem Abebe said, “but going the extra mile, especially at a time like this, just making sure everything is top-notch, that helps.”   Abebe also added that it’s a piece of mind for their customers and employees, who are like family.   “We want them to stay as healthy as possible,” he said.   It’s not just restaurants that use disinfecting services — churches, daycares, gyms and private homes are too.   Mosby said his company will even go into the homes of those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus to help stop the spread.   “There’s so many different ways this virus travels. Being able to come in and stop it before it has the ability to spread to one person and then multiple people is ultimately the goal,” he said.   The cost of these services varies depending on the company. Disinfect-it starts at $200 for the first 1,000 square feet and is $50 for every 500 square feet after that. They’re certified in Maryland, Virginia, D.C. and Pennsylvania.   They also donate their services to a select number of nonprofits, churches and shelters.

(WJZ) —  A high school senior in Howard County was surprised with a “prom package” from Pandora Jewelry for her hard work giving back to the community.  Jena Ialongo, a senior at Glenelg High School, is one of the countless students who won’t have the chance to celebrate milestones like prom together this year due to the coronavirus.   Instead, she attended a virtual prom via video conferencing app Zoom.   “I was really looking forward to wearing my dress and having this opportunity now actually allows me now which is pretty cool,” she said.   Ialongo has a knack for sewing and decided to sew her own prom dress.   When the news hit that school was closed for the rest of the year, her robotics team started making 3D face shields. That inspired her to then start sewing face masks for the University of Maryland School of Nursing.   “I was like, ‘I can sew, I mean I might as well help. I have all this time now,'” she said.   Now, with the help of around a dozen people, they’ve already made more than 1,200 masks.   The mask-making has been a welcome distraction from the disappointment that came with a canceled prom, Ialongo said.   “It’s been really nice to have something to distract me kind of from a lot of the disappointing things that have been canceled,” she said.

It comes in handy when you’re called up to work a box line, or to put you back into unloading a tractor-trailer full of medical supplies, or even setting up a heavy field hospital tent day or night in all conditions.   “I just feel better overall and I can give more to my community when I feel healthy myself,” said Specialist Lauri Gotte.   “Stay active, by whatever means necessary,” said Sergeant Elise Moore.

Grocers are searching for ways to reduce pressure on store workers and increase efficiency amid a surge of shoppers visiting stores and ordering online during the crisis. They believe robots and AI offer solutions that can help them bring down costs and improve store operations.   “There’s strong interest in moving rapidly in this direction because everyone knows they need to raise their game to stay competitive and it’s ultimately more cost-effective to automate than staff up, especially in today’s labor market,” said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail and grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.   Experts say the crisis may speed up grocers’ use of robots in stores.   “I strongly believe that the current health crisis will accelerate the adoption of robots in retail,” said Steven Keith Platt, research director for the Retail Analytics Council and adjunct professor at Northwestern University. “Short-term, this is to address health concerns” of workers and customers, he said. In the long term, robots in stores will stock shelves and prepare food.   How grocers are using robots   In Chevy Chase, Maryland, Broad Branch Market has brought on 44-pound, six-wheel self-driving robots equipped with sensors and AI to ferry deliveries to customers in the area. Broad Branch has closed its stores to shoppers and shifted its operations to delivery and pick-up orders only during the crisis.   “We have had them for a little over a week and they are very popular [with customers],” said store co-owner Tracy Stannard.   Brain Corp., which supplies autonomous floor-scrubbing robots to grocers, said it saw a 13% jump in the usage of its robots at stores in March compared to a year ago. Grocers staying open during the crisis have shortened their hours to allow for deep cleaning overnight.   Walmart, the country’s largest retailer and private employer, will have Brain Corp’s self-driving robots in 1,860 of its more than 4,700 US stores by the end of the year. It will also have robots that scan shelf inventory at 1,000 stores and bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts by the end of the year.   During the crisis, Walmart has continued to roll out robots in stores, a spokesperson said.   The company said the “smart assistants” reduce the amount of time workers spend on “repeatable, predictable and manual” tasks in stores, allowing workers to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles.   At a handful of Schnucks Markets stores in the Midwest, Tally, an autonomous robot, scans shelves to alert employees when products are out of stock or labeled incorrectly, said Brad Bogolea, CEO of Simbe Robotics, which developed the robot.   “This massive surge in demand was a major shock to most retailers’ inventory counts,” said Bogolea. The robot has been helping workers restock items on shelves by giving them real-time data on which items are out, he said.   Clearing the aisles of workers   Grocers are also looking to take the process for picking customers’ online grocery orders out of store aisles. Workers manually picking, bagging and delivering is costly for grocers, and employees picking orders can clog up aisles.   Albertsons, Stop & Shop and other grocers are testing small automated “micro-fulfillment centers” in the backs of their own stores that are dedicated to fulfilling deliveries and pickups. At two stores, Albertsons is using robots to prepare customers’ orders, which it says speeds up the picking process.   Good for business, bad news for workers   Takeoff Technologies, one of the companies that has created these mini-warehouses, has seen a double-digit increase in orders since the crisis began.   “Robots handle a majority of the leg-work when fulfilling orders, meaning there is limited contact with grocery items,” said Jose Aguerrevere, CEO of Takeoff Technologies. The process is “well suited” for social distancing.   Some fear that this type of automation, however, will lead to the disappearance of low-wage jobs.   There are more than 15 million retail workers in America today, and lower-skilled jobs in the industry such as cashiers and clerks are among those vulnerable to technology advances. In the retail industry, “margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice,” according to McKinsey. “Automation will disproportionately disrupt retail.”   The Brookings Institution said in a report  in March  that “any coronavirus-related recession is likely to bring about a spike in labor-replacing automation.”   “Automation happens in bursts, concentrated especially in bad times such as in the wake of economic shocks, when humans become relatively more expensive as firms’ revenues rapidly decline,” the Brookings Institution said in its report.   — Clarification: This story has been updated to describe the role of Tally, an autonomous robot that scans shelves to detect items that are running low or missing.

As the election nears, a recent poll shows there is no clear frontrunner in the race.   Thirty-two candidates — seven Republicans, 24 Democrats and one unaffiliated — are vying for the city’s top office.   WJZ is taking a closer look at the candidates hoping to become the next mayor: in this story is political newcomer Mary Miller.   Miller, a Democrat, is a first-time candidate with a platform that addresses the city’s critical needs. A recent Hart Research poll shows her, former mayor Sheila Dixon and city council president Brandon Scott all polling at 16 percent.   “It confirms some of our internal polling work, so we’re very heartened by that and it gives us a lot of confidence to keep marching forward to the primary on June 2,” Miller said in an interview.   In 2010, then-President Barack Obama appointed her the first woman under secretary of finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.   Miller said her experience in both the public and private sectors sets her apart as a candidate.   “I bring a unique mix of experience in the public sector, the private sector and public policy that I think could be very helpful to Baltimore right now, particularly as we try to recover from the coronavirus,” she said. “My time in the Obama administration following the last recession was squarely focused on economic recovery.”   COVID-19 is also highlighting the city’s needs, Miller said, listing everything from the digital divide to students’ access to education at home to telemedicine and health care access.   She has also prioritized public safety as part of her platform.   “We know there are big issues there, we know … it is hard to do but we’ve got to do that,” she said. “We’ve got to do it more urgently. I would like to bring the same sense of urgency to our crime problems that we have brought to the coronavirus.”   Ballots for the election will begin to be mailed out on Friday.

CBS  Local’s Matt Weiss spoke to series star Simone Missick to discuss the show’s season finale and the challenges of filming an episode over video chat.   MW:  Hi Simone, how a re you holding up with everything?     SM:  I cannot complain!   MW:  That’s good, happy to hear it.  W e’re all doing a little bit of a different interview today on zoom a nd this  we ek ‘s episode of  All Rise  is a little bit different as well being  the show’s first virtual episode .   C an you talk about what went through your mind when they told you we’re going to be doing a virtual episode ?     SM:   W hen they first  read us  their idea of the script .   A ll of us were super excited .   We  immediately thought ,  one the concept sounds very important ,  timely . T hey were able to capture what each character’s personality is and what that would go through during a time of pandemic ,  so we were all excited .   I t wasn’t until we started doing  tech  scouts and location scouts and hair and makeup meetings where they  I ‘m looking at you like are you going to be able to do this .   T hen I was like ,   ‘ oh this is way more difficult than I  thought.’ [Laughs]     I t wasn’t until we started shooting  and  I would be exhausted after like five hours of work .  I said ,   ‘ oh it’s because I’m doing 13 jobs ,  including acting .’   I t was definitely challenging .   I t was a lot of hard work .   T here were a lot of moments where we had to figure out the technology of it .   A  scene that was supposed to start at 10 AM wouldn’t start until 11 because we couldn’t get an actress camera or microphone to connect or the signal was weak .     T hrough all of it we just kept laughing .   W e just kept being appreciative of the fact that we were working .   T here are so many people who are out of work right now especially as actors .   S o ,  for us to get the fortune to be able to do a theater season finale and to do it in this way which is historical .   I t was a blessing, i t  wasn’t lost  on  us .     MW:   A lso ,  very  relatable  for the average nine to five office  worker  as well . I think we’ve all experienced an issue with video chatting. A lot of people on mute accidentally…   SM:   Yeah,  we definitely have a moment in the  episode,  and it came for real life . Ruthie Ann Miles, she  plays Sherry .   S he kept accidentally forgetting to un-mute herself and so we would be doing all this whole scene everything is perfect everyone’s signal is right then  we would  do  is  look over and see her mouth  going with  no  sound.     Everybody is like   Ruthie;  you have you have to unmute yourself .   T hey eventually wrote it into the  episode  and used  that  take where she’s like talking about that fact .  I’m sure that like you said so many people are doing video  meetings from home .   O ur family  has a video  call every day at 4 o’clock to pray together and to catch up and make sure everybody’s doing well and they have what they need .  I think we’re all becoming video chat  expert s.     MW:   W as that difficult bonding with the actors and playing off of each other doing it through the screen when you’re used to being right next to someone ?     SM:   It’s  so interesting because we’ve been working together for a year now .   T here was something very comfort ing  about having this family that we have on the other side of the screen .   T here were times when we’re doing the full court  scenes  and it’s all of the series regulars who’s been there since the beginning pilot .   I t felt like we were in the room together even though we were speaking through a cam e ra because acting is all about listening .   And  yeah,  a lot of it is about being able to touch one another and to feel the energy of the other person .   W e have just really gotten so strong over this time a nd  close as a cast and as a family .    I t felt comforting in the middle of what we’re all going through t o be able to have something that did feel normal .   W e’ve got some really amazing guest actors this episode ,  a gentleman named Moe McRae ,  who actually played my  husband,  or I played his wife on another show .   S o ,  it was nice to know somebody across the room you know the screen that I know  personally,  and his wife plays his girlfriend  on the show.   W hich is great .   T hen I have my husband on the show and obviously I know that dude .   As  strange is the aspect of the screen is it still felt like we were right there with  one another.     MW:  Y ou talked about earlier having to do makeup and lighting and all that stuff .   W as your husband your kind of defacto lighting and camera gu y ?     SM:   No,   he was  definitely my  set  mover of furniture .   W henever I needed something brought from some other part of the house he would definitely step in and help but for the most part we were all doing it on our own .   H e had to shoot one day and  I was definitely there to help him make sure that the setup was right because I’ve gotten so used to it .   For the most part,  no it was me and obviously the 30 or 50 other people who were sitting in the virtual video village saying ,   ‘ hey you know your lightning to do this and you need this computer screen closer for sound ’. W e definitely had about a third of our crew that would still working . J ust not on set .   J ust on the virtual set .   T hat was nice because we weren’t completely alone in it .     MW:  So after all that work w hat can you actually tell us about this week ’ s episode ?   W hen everyone’s  mics were un muted and when everyone was connected and had their lighting ,  what are we actually going to be seeing ?     SM:  [Laughs]  Y ou’re going to see these characters not tumbling through the technology of how does this work ,   h ow do I figure this out a s much as you see them just trying to manage doing their jobs in light of the pandemic .  I think that that’s really cool .  I mean there have been a couple different shows that have made use of this technology .   I t’s been poking fun at the technology  and  seeing skits about it .   This  is really how are these people managing this crisis .   H ow are they able to still seek justice in Los Angeles during a time of pandemic when so many people are vulnerable .     W hen the rights of people who have trials still have to be met and yet at the same  time,  we have to keep people safe .   O ur show , we  walk a fine line between humor and drama .   Y ou will definitely see that in this  episode .   P eople dealing with crisis can sometimes be funny .   W e definitely walk that fine line .   T hen at the end it’s hopeful ,  it makes you feel good .   Which is a nother aim that our show has .   W e want you to take this ride with us and get on this rollercoaster or  Lolacoaster  as  we’d like to affectionately call it .   A t the end of the day feel like  that  there is  hope  because there is .     MW:    Most  of the time it’s a thin line between comedy and tragedy balancing those two .   W hat does it mean to you to be able to provide people with that comedy and that distraction from what’s really going on in the world right now for the time that they sit down to watch  All Rise ?     SM:  I,  like most people, spend a lot of time watching show s.   B ingeing shows .   C atching up on  reality  TV that I would never have the time to watch .   W hen I watch these things it’s inevitable that I look and I go ,   ‘ oh that’s BC that’s before corona .’ You’re watching  people in restaurants and hugging each other and drinking and going to the movies and you’re like that was before Corona .  L ike ,   ‘ Oh my goodness .’     T here’s a feeling of ,  it’s a gift ,  it’s a blessing to be able to give people something where they can still take that journey and be distracted and be entertained .   For  it to feel close to what they’re going through right now .   F or it to feel present and in the moment .   F or it to not feel like a faraway moment  that they  took for granted five weeks ago versus where it is today .   H ow they can live in the moment and still be thankful and recognize that there are some good things that are coming out of this tragedy .   I t just feels great to give people something timely .     Also  being able to say goodbye to our audience for this season .   T his is our season finale .   I t wasn’t what we planned but it’s great to be able to give them a proper farewell until season two . Hopefully!   MW:   Well t hat’s all  I  have  for you today Simone.

CBS Local’s Matt Weiss spoke to Cedric and Greenfield to discuss tonight’s episode, quarantine and potential side gigs.   MW:  Hey Cedric, Max, awesome to speak with both of you today! With everything  going on right now ,  how are you both holding up?       CTE:  I’m doing great for  the situation ,  after two months and kind of being quarantined in  the house. I’m anxious to get out in  the world again but overall though ,  good . L ike most people exercising a lot more ,  spending quality time with my kids and wife ,  so it’s been good .     MG:    Yeah, I’m the  same .   D efinitely feel really fortunate to be in a position where  we get  to be home .  I don’t have to go out .   A lo t , lot  of family time but yeah it is what it is we’re making the best of it .     MW:  Are there  any new activities you’ve been coming up with during  quarantine?     MG:   S o many .  I hope none of them stick [Laughs].   We’re passing the time for sure.     CTE:  Y eah nothing crazy different for me .   A  little bit more of the typical walking in the neighborhood so I’m meeting a lot of new neighbors .   P eople that normally we’re all in our cars and just kind of going past each other .   J ust kind of like ,   ‘ oh that’s the person that lives in that house ’,  but now you got , “hey we’re the  Steinfelds ”, and you’re like, ‘ OK  how are you guys  and  your  dog ? Oh, look at him,   what a  b iggy .’ N ow you have a little bit more idea  of the  people who live next to you .   It’s  kind of interesting to meet them  out on these walks  in the neighborhood .     MW:   S ome positives , that’s  always good to see .   W hat about the cast ? H ave you all done  anything “together” ?     MG:  W e did a big video call  with everybody the other day but we’re always checking in on each other .   Text and phone.   S eems like everybody’s doing OK .     CTE:  Y eah ,   I ‘ve been posing .   I like to,  from time to time ,  just kind of pose as a door dash driver just so  I  can get close to see  M ax and  Tichina .   I ‘ll just go by,  I won’t even have f ood,  I’ll just have the outfit and the hot bag where I can just put stuff in there . J ust stand outside their house and say ,  ‘ hey  guys !’   and they’ll say, ‘hey  where ’s  my chicken wings ’,   and I’m  like ,   ‘ I’m sorry  I ‘m not a real  D oor  D ash  d ude .     MW:  [Laughs] W ell maybe it’s a side job for you .   Y ou already have the uniform .       CTE:   Yeah exactly.   I don’t know why I didn’t think about actually making money with it .   B ut I  do it to go see people.      MW:  N ice ,  nice .   Y ou  two  have a great relationship .   T he relationship between Dave and Calvin didn’t start off so great but that’s grown a lot as the show is going on .   C an you talk about that relationship and how it’s grown over the seasons ?     MG:  I think it’s been a really nice partnership between both Cedric and I and the writers .   T rying to find a really smart balance of not keeping it totally contentious between the two of them .   A llowing  them  to really have moments where they come  together  and we see their friendship .   But  also ,  at the same time not letting them get too close .  I think in terms of Cedric and I  on set  and what we’ve been able to establish it’s been really special,  really organic .  I can’t speak for Cedric ,  but I very much enjoyed my time working on this show .  I think our relationship on the show is something that I’m most proud .     CTE:  Y eah same here for sure .  I think that all the intentions of what the show is about  in the   fir st place .   It’s  really start ed  to show  it self right here in this second season .   It’ s  the  idea of   kind of having prejudices and ideas  against  someone because you don’t know them .   In the second  season we start to get to know each other a little bit ,  those idiosyncras ies,   those  small things that makes a person  tick  and those things that  tick  you off .  I t’s  in that thread is where you find  its a  great bond of uniqueness  and  friendship .   T hat’s what Dave and Calvin  are  start ing   to find  throughout the season .   O f course,  a lot of funny .    T hese last two episodes are really a great example of that because  Dave  tries to do something good and  in the middle of doing  something  good ,  he tries to take it another level further  and  Calvin  is  just not with it . He  tries to run for City Council ,  with his first time out , he  expects to win .       MW:  I was go ing to  ask about tonight , where  we’ll see  an  episode where  Max, your  character runs for City Council  and  Cedric your character helps him out .   C an you talk about what we’re going to see with that a little bit more ?     MG:   Y eah .  Dave is out in front of the house and  has a  near death experience  where he’s almost  run over by a car .   H e decides to petition within the community to get a  speed bump  put in .   H e’s successful and  it ignites a  sense of civic dut y,  so he decides to run for City Council .   T he incumbent at the moment is played by Wayne Brady who is the City Councilman at the time .  Calvin sort of reluctantly helps Dave get ready for an election run .     MW:   F irst thing that popped in my head when you said Wayne Brady was the  C happelle Show  skit .  Is that the Wayne Brady we’ll be seeing as your antagonist.   CTE:   Y eah,  he does a little bit of bo th.   The  CBS version of where he’s the good guy and he’s just kind  of  a bad guy  where you see this  under tone.   He  plays  this very  cool version of what would be a politician who’s charming and loving to the people who got his back .    T hen  w he n   he finds out someone is  challenging  him;  you see this  the  evil  Wayne  Brady ,   the  Chappelle Show  Wayne Brady. We tried to capture that.   U nfortunately ,  this is supposed to be a  three-show   arc.  W e weren’t able to finish that last one that really  round  his character little more b ut we love what it was doing .       MW:  A s part of the election campaign do you dress up as  D oor  D ash guys and go to  people’s  houses and just put stuff in their mailboxes ?   I s that really where this  c ame  from?     MG:  [Laughs]  That was our finale  and we weren’t able to shoot it . That was the last episode.     MW:  Bummer. H opefully you do that next season at some point .     MG:  We hope .     MW:  L ast question for you both  be for e I  let you go .   T onight,  a  double episode and a lot of people are going through a tough time but TV and  The Neighborhood  gives people a chance to escape. What does it mean to each of you to be able to fill some of that void for people?   CTE:   W ell I think it’s really great .   I’m  really excited that in the past few weeks people just really still stay tuned into the show, w atching  each w e e k, it ‘s great .   It   let s  you know that people are at home   with their families .   We’l l provide a great family form of entertainment .   It’s  making people laugh and also growing and learning and looking at their neighbors differently .  I’m just really proud to be a part of the show, e xcited that people lov ing it.     MG:   This is something we’re  all really proud of  b efore any of this happened is that this has always been a family show .   A show  that you can gather everybody together on a Monday night or whenever you want to watch it and sit down and watch it and have a nice experience with your entire family .   W hether it’s your brother ,  your sister or your kids  or  whatever  it is,  I think that’s something we’ve always been proud of ;  especially at a time like  this.       MW:  Thank you both so much for the time today and all the best, stay safe!   MG:  Thanks man, you too.   CTE:  Take care of yourself, Matt.

The health and welfare of the people of our state are directly involved in this,” Cardin said.   Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger blasted President Trump’s handling of the pandemic, saying it appeared the president’s strategy was cobbled together.   “If we continue to move forward without getting any money to local government, it’s going to affect the basics,” he said. “We have a president that his strategy was, ‘I’m going to be the king. I’m going to take over.’ Well, I’ve seen no comprehensive strategy there, and if that’s not going to be there, we’re going to jump in with governors and do whatever we can to get the resources to do the job.”   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young noted the city is “resilient” but cautioned against opening Maryland too quickly.   “We want to make sure to do it in the right way — that we follow exactly what our health care professionals are telling us to do.

One DPW employee spoke to WJZ’s Paul Gessler about his symptoms and his message to the public. WJZ had interviewed sanitation worker Maurice Harried just one week before he tested positive.   He told us he doesn’t know how he contracted coronavirus.   Almost three weeks ago, Harried was on his trash route in south Baltimore when WJZ interviewed him.   Sanitation Workers Considered Essential And Busy With Rise In Residential Trash   “Hoping we go home healthy, you know, don’t carry anything home to our families,” he told WJZ at the time.   Harried spoke with us from his couch Monday as he recovered from COVID-19.   “I thank God for my health. I’m glad I didn’t bring anything home to my wife and my kid,” he said.   Maurice started feeling symptoms a couple of days after our interview. He tested positive a week later with chills, body aches and a feeling he’d been hit in the ribs.   “Along with my chest and it was like something I’d never experienced before, and I went on with that for like 10 days,” Harried said.   The two other guys on his crew quarantined, and so did the WJZ crew as soon as his family member said something.   Even with masks on, they were briefly within six feet to place a GoPro and microphone. Harried said he took all the precautions.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     “What we do on a daily basis, wearing gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, and things like that,” Harried said.   He’s among several Baltimore city employees with the virus. As of Monday afternoon, city officials say 35 members of the police department tested positive; of them, 25 have returned to work.   All 14 city firefighters who tested positive are now back. Harried said he hopes others will listen to warnings to stay home and distance.     Additionally, Baltimore’s Joint Information Center manager reports about a third of city employees are teleworking.  pic.twitter.com/dQZ49zI7sY   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  May 4, 2020     “Stay your distance. Wear your mask,” he said. ” When it hit me, it hit home and it let me know it’s a wake-up call. If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone.”   Overall, Maurice’s case was fairly mild.   He said he’s just about back to 100 percent and a doctor has cleared him to return to work. Harried thinks he’ll wait it out a few more days.

Out-of-work Americans welcomed the financial relief brought on by the Paycheck Protection Program when President Trump signed the CARES Act into law in late March, but now they’re running into a tricky decision: go back to work and make less money or stay at home and make more on unemployment.   READ MORE: Here’s What Maryland Is Getting As Part Of The Coronavirus Stimulus Package   “Why would you come back to work when you can make more money staying at home?” Patrick Russell, the owner of Kooper’s Tavern in Fells Point, wondered.   Russell owns multiple businesses and said he qualified for funds through the program but his restaurants remain empty due to the state’s stay-at-home order. That means no tips for his servers, busboys or bartenders who rely on them.   “When you go from doing millions of dollars in business to nothing, we are all in the same boat,” he said.   CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:      Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   Coronavirus In Maryland: What We Know   Coronavirus-Related Closings   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     A nail technician told WJZ she’s getting a fraction of her base salary from her employer, and because of that, she no longer qualifies for federal unemployment. Despite that, she’s still not able to go into work to make tips.   “We are kind of in that catch 22, we can’t quit because then we won’t receive unemployment at all, and    I won’t get paid PPP; however, I remain employed, I am not receiving the $600, so it’s really frustrating,” she said.   Russell believes the first steps to recover will be to partially reopen.   “As we are able to grow that I’ll bring more people back, but the idea is to make sure that when they come back, they can make more than what they are getting from the PPP, and until I can guarantee that, they are not going to want to come back,” he said.   Restaurant owners in Fells Point are pushing the city to close part of Thames Street to allow them to put tables outside and serve more customers while following social distancing guidelines.

View this document on Scribd   They aren’t the first Maryland municipality to do so — Montgomery County previously filed a lawsuit.   According to Howard County’s lawsuit, Juul is a “major cause” of the teen vaping epidemic.   The popularity of Juul products led another company, Eonsmoke, LLC, to use social media campaigns to market its products, which is said were Juul-compatible, directly to youth and also offered flavors enticing to youth like “Sour Gummy,” “Pineapple Crush,” and “Pink Lemonade.” The lawsuit said those ads were deceptive.   The lawsuit also alleges during industry studies “employees tested new liquid-nicotine formulations on themselves or on strangers taking smoke breaks on the street. Sometimes, the mix packed too much punch – enough nicotine to make some testers’ hands shake or send them to the bathroom to vomit….”   In a statement, a Juul spokesperson said:   “Our customer base is the world’s 1 billion adult smokers and we do not intend to attract underage users. We will continue to reset the vapor category in the U.S. and seek to earn the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders to combat underage use and transition adult smokers from combustible cigarettes. As part of that process in the U.S., we are preparing comprehensive and scientifically rigorous Premarket Tobacco Product Applications, stopped the sale of flavored pods other than Tobacco and Menthol in November, halted our television, print and digital product advertising and support the Administration’s final flavor policy.”                                 ", "sentiment": -0.02997589531680441, "subjectivity": 0.33694903581267216, "wordcount": 320}

(WJZ) —  After reports that a roughly two-inch long insect known as the “murder hornet” has made its way to the U.S. for the first time ever into Washington State, the Maryland Department of Agriculture says it received many calls on Monday about the hornet.  “We continue to monitor, though it is highly unlikely that the hornet is present in Maryland,” the department tweeted Monday.     We have received many calls today about the Asian giant hornet, referred to in media coverage as the \"Murder Hornet.\" This insect was found in Washington state in late 2019. We continue to monitor, though it is highly unlikely that the hornet is present in Maryland.   — Maryland Agriculture (@MdAgDept)  May 4, 2020     The Asian giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia, has been known to kill up to 50 people a year in Japan,  according to the New York Times.   “One of the reasons it’s so frightening is the sheer amount of venom it can inject and the amount of times it can sting,” entomologist Samuel Ramsey with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.   The hornets are usually between 1.5 to 2 inches long, have large yellow-orange heads with prominent eyes, and a black and yellow striped abdomen.   According to the USDA , they are the largest hornets in the world. Besides feeding on flowers, they are known to band together to target yellow jackets and other bee species in mass attacks, decapitating and eating parts of the smaller bees.     WSDA says on its website that the hornets do not typically go after humans, but if they do, not even beekeeping suits can protect against the hornets’ stingers, which are longer and more dangerous than a bee’s.   Ramsey said the sting delivers seven times the amount of venom of a normal bee and multiple stings can prove deadly.   “These wasps are very large, they are like armored tanks, their exoskeletons are very thick,” Ramsey said, adding just a few of the hornets can clean out a colony of around 60,000 bees.   Scientists do not yet know how the hornets made it to the U.S.   Read more on CBS News.    Maryland’s Department of Agriculture told residents if anyone has found a suspicious insect on their property, to send pictures to ppwm.mda@maryland.gov.

He was 96.   Lester’s daughter, Amy Lester Greco, said on a Facebook post that her father died Sunday in Rockville, Maryland, due to complications from the new coronavirus.   “How blessed I am to have been his only daughter,” she wrote. “I am not a perfect person but everything good about me came from this beautiful man.”   After a 10-year run at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville during which the Rockets went unbeaten six times and had an 86-10-1 record, Lester was hired in 1968 to coach at Maryland.   He inherited a program that won only two of 19 games over the previous two years.   Lester guided the Terrapins to a 3-7 record in his first year and went 2-9 in each of the next two seasons before being fired. He was followed by Jerry Claiborne, who led Maryland to seven bowl games over 10 seasons.   In a Twitter post, current Maryland coach Michael Locksley said of Lester: “He came up the ranks as a high school coach and took over during a tumultuous time. He laid the solid foundation for the Claiborne era.”   Lester returned to high school coaching in 1972 and won three state championships over the next 15 years while coaching at Paint Branch and Magruder.   When he retired in 1993, Lester had won 260 games at the high school level, a far contrast from his 7-25 career record at Maryland.   Lester grew up in Spencer, West Virginia, and attended college at West Virginia University, where he lettered in football, basketball and baseball.   He graduated in 1949 with a degree in political science.   He began his coaching career in 1950 at Walton High School in West Virginia.   After two years there, Lester moved on to Allegany High School in Cumberland, Maryland. He was an assistant coach at Maryland for three years before taking over at Richard Montgomery.

While you have a little extra free time in the house quarantining during the pandemic, it’s a good way to make sure you’re helping your baby develop optimally.   Tummy time is a type of physical activity recommended for babies who are less than 6 months old. Prior to their learning how to roll over or crawl, it’s a simple way to help babies begin to develop their basic motor skills.   Researchers from the University of Wollongong in Australia reviewed the findings that researchers had reported in 16 published studies. In total, those studies had examined 4,237 participants from eight countries. The review was released Tuesday.   The new paper, “Tummy Time and Infant Health Outcomes: A Systemic Review,” concluded that tummy time is positively associated with gross motor and total development, as well as the ability to move while prone or supine, which includes crawling and rolling.   During tummy time, the time the baby is awake on his or her stomach, can help ameliorate certain negative effects, such as plagiocephaly, or flat head syndrome. Head flattening can be associated with babies spending too much time laying on their backs and can require treatment later.   With bath time, changing diapers, putting babies to sleep and innumerable other parental tasks, however ,  parents don’t always make space for tummy time as well.   “Tummy time can sometimes take a back seat,” said Dr. Jennifer Shu, the author of “ Heading Home With Your Newborn ” and medical editor of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ website for parents,  HealthyChildren.org .   But she noted that it’s important to try and carve out time blocks each day for the practice, totaling 30 minutes over a 24-hour period.   “This really does affect how your baby will roll or crawl,” she said.   Tummy time may prevent head abnormalities   In 1992, in reaction to the high prevalence of sudden infant death syndrome, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that babies be laid down on their back — in a supine position — to sleep.   The resulting Back to Sleep  campaign  is credited with helping reduce the number of babies who died from so-called “crib death.”   Although babies’ lives were being saved, pediatricians and researchers observed a separate trend: Babies laid down to sleep or rest on their backs tended to develop motor skills more slowly and had increased amounts of abnormalities in head shape. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics,  these include  brachycephaly — a symmetrically flat head — as well as plagiocephaly, a condition in which a baby’s head is asymmetrically flat on one side.   To easy into tummy time, experts recommended starting as early as when parents and a newborn return home from the hospital, starting with just a few minutes each day, gradually working up to a half hour daily, and then to a full hour daily.   Tummy time can lead to “small yet tangible goals parent can strive to meet,” the study’s authors wrote. These can include sparking the littlest developments that are part of being human: the ability to lift one’s head, the ability to move arms and legs while laying down and our ability to sit with our arms supporting us.   Tummy time can also improve a baby’s cardiovascular health and help improve an infant’s body mass index, or BMI, according to research included in the review.   The World Health Organization  recommends  tummy time as the best form of physical activity for infants less than 1 year old.   Many parents don’t give their babies tummy time   Though it’s been a recommendation for more than two decades, not all parents have their babies do tummy time.   In Australia, where the review was conducted, the authors pointed out data showing that adherence to infant physical activity guidelines is 75% for child care providers, but just 30% for parents. They say those low adherence rates can be correlated with older parents and low education levels, and that receiving information about tummy time from a pediatrician doesn’t actually have a significant mark on whether or not parents do it.   So the scientists argued for more research into the drivers behind why parents aren’t taking up the activity.   One basic reason tummy time might not be intuitive is that babies tend to cry when left by themselves on the floor, Shu explained. Parents not wanting to hear babies cry might scoop their kids right back up to soothe them.   “People are busy and babies don’t like it,” she said. That’s all the more reason to introduce tummy time gradually right from the time a newborn comes home so it becomes part of the daily routine for both parents and baby alike.   Shu advised parents that one of the best parts of the day for tummy time could be “right after changing their diaper.”   The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

That is what made the divisional round playoff exit so painful for the fanbase, as they watched the underdog Tennessee Titans roll into the AFC Championship Game.   Entering the offseason, it was clear the team needed to make some upgrades, and general manager Eric DeCosta wasted no time doing just that. DeCosta traded a fifth-round pick to the Jaguars to nab Pro Bowl defensive end Calais Campbell. He re-signed veteran pass rusher Pernell McPhee, placed the franchise tag on Matt Judon and then signed veteran d-lineman Derek Wolfe in free agency.   Then came the NFL Draft, where the team added a pair of linebackers (Patrick Queen and Malik Harrison), a defensive tackle (Justin Madubuike), a running back (J.K. Dobbins), wide receiver (Devin Duvernay) and two offensive linemen (Tyre Phillips and Ben Bredeson) in the first four rounds.   Linebacker, wide receiver and offensive line were marked as needs for the team entering the offseason. It would appear they filled every single one of those holes, and NFL On CBS analyst Charles Davis was left very impressed.   “For a team that was the best team in the AFC by record and got to the divisional round, they could not have had a better offseason,” said Davis. “I thought their draft was tremendous. I thought their offseason in free agency was tremendous. They were a team that didn’t just say, ‘okay we were great last year, we expect to be good this year.’ They’re trying to take the next step.”   That next step, of course, would be to try and take down the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC. On that front, Davis counts the Ravens as one of several teams that made moves that should help in the chase.   “Baltimore has made every move that you would love in the offseason for a team that got upset in the divisional round,” said Davis.   The Chiefs still reign over the conference until they get knocked from their perch. And with 20 of 22 starters back to go with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, it won’t be an easy task. That said, the Ravens are hoping to chart a similar course as Kansas City. Mahomes won rookie of the year, MVP and piled up stats in his first full year as starter in 2018. Then he was put on the Madden cover, didn’t have quite the same statistical season, but delivered a Super Bowl.   Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson set records, won MVP and offensive player of the year in 2019. He’s now set to be on the cover of Madden 21. Is a Super Bowl in the offing? We’ll find out when the league returns to action this fall.                                 ", "sentiment": 0.18162257495590828, "subjectivity": 0.42395943562610233, "wordcount": 460}

(WJZ) —  New federal guidelines requiring states to capture more information about unemployment insurance claimants has created another obstacle in what some say is an already frustrating process to file for unemployment insurance in Maryland.  The new guideline has created confusion for claimants as they complete their weekly claim on the BEACON One-Stop portal, according to the state’s Department of Labor.   “Federal guidance has required states to capture additional information from claimants as they complete their weekly claim certification,” state labor secretary Tiffany P. Robinson said in a statement. “Marylanders found these new required questions to be confusing, resulting in numerous claimants inactivating their eligibility for unemployment benefits.”   The question causing the most confusion asked people if they received unemployment compensation under any state, from the federal government or from Canada, a department spokesperson said. It has since been changed to clarify that it’s asking about any other state excluding Maryland.   In response to feedback, Robinson said her department implemented and automatic solution to reactivate these claims and prevent benefits from being interrupted.

Nothing is more important to us than ensuring that all eligible Marylanders receive the benefits they need and deserve as soon as possible,” Robinson said in a statement.

(WJZ)–  Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have begun testing experimental COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.  The research, funded by Pfizer Inc., will study the safety, efficacy, and dosing of an experimental mRNA-based vaccine.   The vaccine research is being conducted in the UMSOM Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, and it is part of a multicenter study in the U.S. and in Germany that will include up to 360 participants in this initial stage.   “We are all here working very long days,” said Dr. Kirsten Lyke, a professor with the University of Maryland School of Medicine.   Researchers said the trial will trick the body into thinking it has COVID-19 without any actual symptoms. They’ll then wait to see how the four vaccines being tested will respond.   “Our goal is to have a viable vaccine candidate that can go into mass production by the autumn,” Lyke said.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     In Baltimore, the clinical trial includes up to 90 healthy adult participants between 18 and 85 years of age.   One of the participants is UMSOM graduate student David Rach.   “As soon as I heard about it, it was something I was interested in doing,” he said.   Like many people, Rach said he knows others, including members of his family, who are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.   He hopes his participation will help bring about a cure.   “My hope at the end of this is that we get a vaccine quickly,” he said.

MW:  And now we have the s eason finale on Tuesday,  w hat can you tell us about this episode ?     JM:   It’s an  interesting one because for the first time we see a few different things,  p articularly from my character Jess that we haven’t really seen before .   I t’s about a father-son team who escaped from prison in the middle of a transportation to another prison .   T hey’re both criminals and both bank robbers and they go into this spree of robbing banks to try and finance their ability to get out of the country .   The  Clock is ticking ,  as we kind of follow their trail t o  get there before they actually  get the  amount of money .  they go about it by r obbing small banks with little bits every night . Then they go for a large heist and that’s where we catch ’em.

T his is first time we get to see it .     Then we also  see  his brother in law  on e of  the five team members, h e  encourages him to contemplate meeting other people .  To be a bit more  social.  He’s the least  social guy  you’d meet, he  just wouldn’t  do  that kind of stuff .   He  tries to encourage him to come out of his shell a little bit ,  I guess is a nice way to describe it .     W e have a couple of  scenes  where he  meets  a couple of  people.

WJZ is taking a closer look at the candidates hoping to become the next mayor: in this story is former Baltimore Police Department spokesperson T.J. Smith.   Smith grew up in Baltimore, went through the city’s public school system and suffered through the city’s pervasive culture of violence. His brother Dion was fatally shot in his west Baltimore apartment  in 2017.   “We’ve seen the violence personally affect so many people in this city, and even in the course of this pandemic, we haven’t really seen it let up,” Smith said.   This is his first run for public office, and he’s focused on safety, schools and quality of life.   “I elected to run as a non-politician because I feel like it’s time to reset, to get to a place where a regular human is doing the work of the people and not trying to be this politician and rise to fame that way,” Smith said.   There has been some criticism about the lack of transparency in city government.   “We know that there is unfortunately some waste, fraud and abuse that goes on, and we really have to hold ourselves accountable to that same level of scrutiny and make sure that’s not something that’s commonplace in government,” he said.   While the frontrunner in the race seems to vary between polls, one poll put Smith at the top.   “It says that the people see everyone as potential leaders for the city, which is a good problem to have in a lot of ways,” he said.

(WJZ) —  Ocean City, Maryland Mayor Rick Meehan said when the beach and boardwalk opens this Saturday, police will not be enforcing the town’s local-only mandate.  Meehan also said beach visitors will also not be required to wear a mask. He said people visiting the beach should, however, follow social distancing and limit groups to 10 people or fewer. Police will be patrolling the beach and boardwalk to remind people to social distance, should they see crowds gathering.   Ocean City closed its beaches in March following the governor’s stay at home order to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.   Ocean City, Maryland Beaches, Boardwalk Reopening For Locals On May 9   The beach town mayor held a press conference Tuesday morning after news broke late Monday about the beaches reopening May 9  after town officials previously said they would reopen on May 15. The mayor  made the declaration  during the council meeting and said it would be a way for locals to get fresh air and exercise.   “I wanted to take this opportunity to provide some information on the decision to issue the declaration opening the town of Ocean City’s beach, boardwalk, and inlet parking lot effective Saturday, May 9,” Meehan said. “I want to make it clear that this does not supersede any executive orders made by Governor [Larry] Hogan to stay at home. The governor’s [order] is still in effect this does not supersede that. At this time you should only travel to Ocean City if doing so would not be in violation of the governor’s specific stay at home.”   But on Tuesday, Meehan said he knows he cannot stop other Marylanders or others from coming into Ocean City. He just hopes people are responsible.   “The declaration open Ocean City’s beach and boardwalk and then the parking lot on Saturday, May 9 is simply to give away for individuals have more opportunities to go outside, enjoy the fresh air, while still adhering to all social distancing guidelines and gathering limits,” Meehan said. “None of that has changed, nonessential businesses along the boardwalk will continue to be closed until that order was lifted by the governor. The only thing that will really be open on the boardwalk will be some of the carryout restaurants.”     The declaration from the mayor  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/QY9O4NOSsj   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  May 5, 2020     On those who live elsewhere and have Ocean City vacation homes, Meehan said second homeowners have a right to be in their property.   However, things will not be the same for those who do visit. Hotels and short-term rentals will still only be available to essential workers and restaurants will only offer carryout.   The mayor believes opening Saturday will allow for the town to transition from its off-season to on-season crowds.   “Right now there are not very many people in Ocean City, and even with this we do not anticipate a lot of people in Ocean City, but there will be some additional visitors. This will allow for people coming over to Ocean City and this will allow us to make that transition,” he said. “You know phased recovery is what we are trying to abide to. We support the governor’s recovering program we’re trying to work cohesively with that. I think the governor has put us in a position by issuing all his orders early on that we’re able now to take this next step here in Ocean City, what we see and what I see as what I go up to the boardwalk is that people are adhering to the new normal.”   Meehan doesn’t believe crowds will flock to Ocean City this weekend.   “I don’t really think that’s what’s gonna happen,” Meehan said. “You know we’re only at the first weekend in May, and typically even in this time of year in our crowds are much smaller than they’re going to be as you get into the end of the month or into June and particularly into July.”   Lodging restrictions that Ocean City issued for hotels and short term rentals are still in effect and those have extended those restrictions through May 22. He said people visiting won’t have a place to stay with hotels and condos closed in the area.   Lifeguards will also not be on duty until Memorial Day as in previous years.   “There will be no police officers patrolling for license plates. I don’t believe that’s done has been done throughout the state of Maryland, anywhere, and that’s not going to be the case here in Ocean City,” the mayor said. “We do expect people to come from the surrounding areas.”   When pressed again about requirements to wear masks, Meehan said he encourages people to wear a mask if they feel safer.   “There’s no requirement in the state to wear masks in public at this time,” he said. “We certainly want to encourage people if they would feel more comfortable. That’s a personal decision.”   He said the town will be posting signs about social distancing at the entrances of the beach and boardwalk.   “The police presence and being able to converse with people, to give them instructions or at least to bring to their attention when they may not be properly distance, we’re going to continue to do those things. You know voluntary compliance is what we’ve all been looking for,” Meehan said. “I think we’ve seen a great deal of that this won’t succeed nationwide without voluntary compliance. You can’t patrol everywhere. You can’t be everywhere and as I said before that I think a great majority of the people are adhering to these regulations, and I think they will continue to do so.”   When asked if he believes opening the beach Saturday is a violation of the governor’s orders, Meehan said, “I don’t think it’s in violation of any of the general orders enacted by the governor, because we are not encouraging we are not asking anyone to supersede the travel restrictions that are in place.”   Hogan’s office did not push back on the move.“This is a way to give nearby residents more opportunities to get outside and enjoy fresh air while still adhering to social distancing guidelines and gathering limits. The governor’s stay-at-home order remains in effect,” communications managers for Hogan and the Town of Ocean City said in a joint statement late Monday night.   Ocean City is the first beach in the Mid-Atlantic region to reopen. Rehoboth Beach in nearby Delaware had to  remove public benches to enforce their beach and boardwalk  closures through May 15.  Bethany Beach in Delaware  will remain closed until June 1.   However, in New Jersey,  Stone Harbor and Avalon beaches  will reopen Friday.   “The goal of Ocean City has always been for everybody to arrive here safely, be safe while they’re here and return home safely. That has not changed and will not change. So we are moving forward. We believe this phase opening is the right thing to do,” he added.   Statewide, while Maryland’s hospitalization numbers have remained stable, on Tuesday, the state tied its daily record for deaths at 74.     27,117 confirmed  #coronavirus  cases in Maryland for Tuesday, May 5th 709 new cases in 24 hours 112,986 negative tests 1,290 deaths 1,810 recovered   @wjz   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  May 5, 2020     There are so many bodies, an ice rink in Laurel has been turned into a temporary morgue.

Effective 30 days after Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted, bridge drivers without E-ZPass® will be charged the Video Toll rate of $6.   The system includes three highway-speed traffic lanes that will tie into the two existing lanes on the eastbound bridge and the one westbound contraflow (two-way) lane.   “As we convert Maryland toll facilities to all-electronic tolling, now is the time for cash customers to sign-up for E-ZPass® Maryland,” said MDTA Executive Director James F.

Nick Mosby sent a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan Tuesday asking him to release additional coronavirus-related data around race and zip codes.  Specifically, Mosby wants the number of positive and negative tests, hospitalizations and deaths by race and ZIP code.   In early April, Hogan directed the state’s health department to publish information on racial and ethnic breakdowns of COVID-19 cases, but Mosby wants to go further.   Doing so, he said, would make sure the state’s response to COVID-19 is targeted and effective.   “It ensures that whatever plans that we’re developing especially when you have a scarcity of resources and personnel, that you are effectively and equitably using those resources and personnel,” Mosby said.   In a news release, he added that Baltimore fits the pattern of other urban areas when it comes to the virus:   “We cannot fully examine the disproportionalities already presented to us if we do not have the complete picture of the data. We need this real-time to data to ensure we have the resources to go after the areas of concern and to fully understand the totality of this virus. The data provides us with the information we need to micro-target these areas from an engagement, testing, and from a treatment perspective.”   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Sherita Golden, the chief diversity officer at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that in hard-hit New York City, the death rate in African American and Hispanic communities is nearly twice as high as it is in white and Asian American communities.   It’s important to collaborate with state agencies to get high-quality self-identified data, she said.   “So race, ethnicity and gender should also be stratified by language, people with limited English proficiency are going to have particular challenges navigating the healthcare system,” Golden said.   Mosby also wants Hogan to implement a Racial Health Disparities Task Force to assist with review the racial disparity data and plan for a second wave of the virus, saying other governors have implemented similar task forces.   “The fact that we were administering a program in the height of this crisis without factoring in looking at zip code data and looking at race and ethnicity data, right there presents a problem,” Mosby said.   Mosby’s proposal calls for the task force to be made up of public health officials, medical professionals, non-profit organizations and community groups.   In a statement, Hogan’s office said, “We appreciate all of the letters we have received from Delegate Mosby, and his leadership on this issue.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

(AP) —  In their quest to keep quarterback Lamar Jackson upright and running, the Baltimore Ravens have put a priority on fortifying their offensive line following the retirement of eight-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.   It’s unlikely that anyone will step in at right guard with the skill, experience and leadership that Yanda displayed during his 13th and final NFL season. The Ravens are hoping for a minimum drop-off in their effort to keep Jackson healthy and sustain a running attack that last year compiled a single-season record of 3,296 yards.   The concern up front extends beyond the loss of Yanda, who made the 2010-19 All-Decade Team and is a two-time All-Pro. Center Matt Skura finished the season on injured reserve and was replaced by rookie Patrick Mekari. That’s one big reason Baltimore general manager Eric DeCosta picked two versatile offensive linemen in the draft: third-round selection Tyre Phillips of Mississippi State, and fourth-rounder Ben Bredeson of Michigan.   When the Ravens finally get back on the field, coach John Harbaugh will be looking for players to serve alongside left guard Bradley Bozeman and tackles Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown.   Phillips and Bredeson will be given the opportunity to step in right away, but they’ll have to beat out Skura, Mekari and second-year pro Ben Powers.   “I think it’s going to be a competition,” director of player personnel Joe Hortiz said Tuesday. “We’ve got a lot of guys that are already here and on board. But I certainly think (Phillips and Bredeson) have the talent and ability to be right in the mix and compete for that job.”   The 6-foot-5, 315-pound Bredeson started 46 games for the Wolverines at left guard. He played all five positions on the line during practice, however, and has no problem moving to the right side or in the middle of the line.   “I feel comfortable at really any of those interior three spots. Obviously, center is included with that,” he said.   Phillips was a tackle at Mississippi State, but he’s confident he can make the switch to guard and brings an attitude that just might make him an immediate asset.   “My style of play is tough, aggressive and just mean, just nasty, just good-old-down-south, Mississippi-style football,” he said.   Bredeson understands completely the talent level of the player he might be asked to replace.   “Marshal Yanda is a legend. I’ve been watching him for years and years,” Bredeson said. “Being able to play on the same team that he once played on is kind of surreal. It’s a very cool feeling. The offensive line for Baltimore was outstanding last year.”   The key to the Ravens’ offensive success is Jackson, who threw 36 touchdown passes and set an NFL record for yards rushing by a quarterback last year with 1,206. Nothing is more important for the offensive front than to make sure that Jackson, the 2019 NFL MVP, stays healthy and productive.   “He’s a remarkable player, and I’m beyond excited to start working with him,” Bredeson said. “It’ll be something different for me -– having a guy that’s so athletic and so skilled back there.”   (© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The school said decreased enrollment and loss of major financial supporters were major factors in their decision to close, while the coronavirus has added financial hardship.   Enrollment is down 43 percent, leaders said, and the building requires millions of dollars in repairs.   “Regrettably, despite the unwavering dedication of the School Sisters of Notre Dame since our founding in 1847, and their generosity over the last several years – the Atlantic-Midwest Province has contributed several million dollars to try to keep our school in operation – it has recently become clear that there is no way forward – in spite of the tireless efforts of the Sisters, the Board of Trustees and the school’s leadership team.” Provincial Leader Charmaine Krohe said.   They said due to the coronavirus they will not be able to have a physical closing ceremony, but at a later date will hopefully be able to do one.   “It is our shared faith, hope, and love of Notre Dame, Our Lady, that will help us to accept what we cannot change and allow us to move forward courageously, positively and tenaciously. One Mind, One Heart. Mother Theresa, pray for us.” Krohe said.   The 173-year-old school is the oldest all-girls Catholic high school in the state. Students and alumnae mourned its closing.   “These steps and this building mean so much to all of us,” senior Anna Boyd said.   Now, she won’t be able to pass on the legacy to future generations.   “I was always dreaming of coming back here and visiting and sending my own daughter here just like my mom did,” she said.   Senior Sade Randall began tearing up when talking about the closure.   “I just never would have thought this would happen,” she said.   Nancy Longo, who graduated in 1980, said she was shocked by the announcement and is praying for a miracle.   “It made all the difference to me in my life and how I became the person I became,” she said.   In a statement, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a former student of the school, said she was profoundly saddened by the announcement.   “When I heard today that the Institute of Notre Dame would be closing its doors permanently a profound sadness came over me,” she said in part. “For over 170 years, IND has inspired young women to think independently and to act courageously, positively, and tenaciously. Baltimore is truly losing a treasured institution.”   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, also a former student, weighed in on Twitter Tuesday night, calling it “sad news.”   “Is creed – Pro Deo et Patria – is enshrined in our hearts,” she wrote.

(WJZ) —  With many restaurants remaining closed, or only offering takeout, the oyster industry has taken a huge hit.   At the True Chesapeake Oyster Farm in southern Maryland, business isn’t just down: it’s almost nonexistent.   Manager and oyster farmer Ethan Davis said it wouldn’t be uncommon to sell between 15,000 and 30,000 oysters a week, but with COVID-19, the demand simply isn’t there.   “People enjoy (oysters) when they are raw, and sitting at a table with a nice glass of beer, and yeah it’s not very takeout-friendly,” said Davis.   The good news is oysters can stay in the water until they’re once again in demand, but the bad news is they keep growing.   CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:     Coronavirus Resources: How To Get Help In Maryland   What We Know About Coronavirus In Maryland   Latest coronavirus stories from WJZ     Davis said their ideal oysters range from two and a half to four inches, and they can usually keep them that size for three to four months.   “Once they stay in the water any longer than that they end up getting a little bigger than 4 inches and that can definitely affect how many we sell,” Davis said.   It’s not that they’re bad, they’re just big and usually require restaurants to get creative in the way they prepare them.   Large oysters are good for frying, baking, grilling or even in soup.   Davis said even though they’re not selling, the oysters still need to be cared for, on top of that it’s growing season.   This time of year can keep five employees busy for eight to nine hours a day, but due to the lack of sales, most of True Chesapeake Oyster Farm employees have been furloughed.   “We need to pick the oysters up, run them, sort them, clean them and then deploy them,” Davis said, “It normally takes three guys on the boat, and two guys on the pier and now it’s just me.”   It’s hard work, all to ensure this Maryland delicacy is on the menu when business is back to normal.   If you’re in the mood for oysters now,  you can pre-order them, and pick them up in Baltimore.

This comes as city schools have remained closed since March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.   “As long as I’ve been in public service um I truly believe that’s what this job is all about serving the public. I’ve always had two guiding principles of constituent service, and an unwavering commitment to children,” Young said.

The schools used their own budget to purchase 11,000 Chromebooks to help students access virtual learning, but there was still a gap.   “With that, we still fell far short of where our target is, which is making sure that all families and all students have access,” said City Schools CEO Dr. Sonja Santelises. “So, with that context, the mayor’s announcement today is a welcome addition, a welcome boost. I want to thank the leadership of Mayor Young, of our city council president, of our city council really stepping forward and providing this additional money.”   The money will help the schools purchase 3,500 more Chromebooks and also provide families with devices who have challenges accessing broadband internet.   “This is not a minor investment, and it is one that I am pleased and thrilled, on behalf of all of Baltimore City students, their families, our teachers to say thank you so much for Baltimore City leadership for really stepping up,” Santelises added.   “This is about a city that faced a profound crisis that came together and put the needs of children,” said Councilman Zeke Cohen. “Above politics, and I think it shows a lot of maturity and leadership on the part of the mayor, the President, the council, all of us working together, that we were able to get this done, and make what is truly a historic commitment to closing the digital divide.”   For the latest information on coronavirus go to the  Maryland Health Department’s website  or call 211.

In response, one local organization is meeting kids where they are at lunch distribution sites around the city and providing creative arts lessons to take home.   Here’s how “Young Audiences” is stepping up to fill the gaps of the digital divide.   Nine-year-old Zamirah Hall, a third-grader, loves arts and crafts.   “This is fun and I like this,” Zamirah said.   She is just one of many students right now wishing they were back in their classrooms.   “I miss my friends and I want to be at school for some reason,” she said. “I don’t know why I want to be at school?”   But thanks to the organization, Young Audiences, kids can still explore their creativity at home.   One activity is called snacks. No, it’s not the kind you eat.   “We call them snacks, cause they are designed to go right alongside meal distribution. It’s a part of a well-balanced diet. You need to be making things along with looking at stuff on screens,” said Matt Barinholtz, a Young Audiences teaching artist and founder of Futuremakers.

Over the next few weeks, Young Audiences plans to distribute all 9,000 “snack” kits at every meal site continuing to feed hungry young minds throughout Baltimore.

The proposed budget for fiscal year 2021, was completely rewritten in early April as the city’s finances took a turn following the COVID-19 pandemic.   In March, Mayor Young proposed a hiring freeze for any nonessential workers. and mandated a freeze on spending. Those will remain into fiscal year 2021.   “This was an incredibly difficult budget process,” Young said. “Every City and county in the country are facing difficult budgetary decisions, and Baltimore is no different. What sets us apart, however, is the fact that even in the face of financial pressures, our commitment to our children and families is rock solid. The budget I presented makes very clear that Baltimore values its children, older adults, and most vulnerable residents. Even with the economic downturn, I believe that this is a smart and realistic budget.”   The mayor’s new budget protects core city services and functions but invests heavily in five key priority areas.   Young proposes a total city budget of $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2021, which starts July 1. This includes $3 billion of operating expenses and $832 million of capital investments.   Due to coronavirus, the city estimates a trimming of $103.1 million to account for revenue losses.   City services like police patrol, emergency response services, trash collection and recycling, and direct health services are maintained in the new budget. There are also no new taxes or increased fees and the city’s property tax rate remains flat.   The mayor has gone to the city police and firefighter unions to propose several scenarios, some of which include layoffs. But, Young said it’s the last thing he wants to do.   Those options are a salary freeze and possible furloughs, in lieu of layoffs.   City officials say they are still awaiting a response from the unions.   A breakdown of key Investments:   Children and Families:  The Mayor’s budget includes record investments in public education. The Mayor’s budget includes funding to pay for historic school construction as part of the State’s Build to Learn School Construction Program. In addition to the more than $400 million invested in direct payment to the Baltimore City Public School System, the Mayor’s budget also includes nearly $100 million of additional spending on youth-related programs, like laptops for students to do distance learning, YouthWorks summer jobs, and other initiatives.   Public Safety:  The Mayor’s budget includes $1.4 million to pay for two new Baltimore Community Intelligence Centers. The centers are modeled after a successful crime-fighting strategy that showed successful results in Chicago. The Mayor’s budget also invests heavily in patrol and community-oriented policing.   A Clean and Healthy City:  The Mayor’s budget includes investments in the City’s capital infrastructure, like water, wastewater, and stormwater funds. The budget includes a total of $608 million of new capital investments, like improvements to treatment facilities, pumping stations, stream restorations, and drainage upgrades.   Equitable Neighborhood Development:  The Mayor’s budget invests $42.1 million to grow the Housing Department’s community development framework, which includes services like demolition, homeownership incentives, and affordable housing. The Mayor recognized that cultural institutions and attractions represent an important part of a City’s vibrancy and health. To that end, Mayor Young’s budget maintains funding for arts institutions and cultural attractions that have been hit hard by closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Innovative Government:  In the face of a challenging budgetary outlook, Mayor Young decided it critically important to also invest in innovative solutions to the tough challenges that cities like Baltimore face. The Mayor’s budget includes $10 million for a variety of IT infrastructure projects that includes an upgraded data warehouse, new cable and wiring, and investments in new cyber-security tools.

Judge Stephanie Gallagher says she will issue a ruling on the temporary restraining order argued in court “as soon as possible.”   The lawsuit brought against Bank of America accuses the company of prioritizing its existing customers when doling out federal funds as part of the Paycheck Protection Program, essentially a forgivable loan program created by the $2 trillion CARES Act, also known as the coronavirus stimulus law.   The program makes nearly $350 billion available in the form of government-backed loans meant for small businesses to cover eight weeks’ worth of payroll and other expenses.   In its 16-page lawsuit filed earlier this month in Maryland, Baltimore-based marketing firm Profiles PR said Bank of America’s implementation of the law was discriminatory:   “Defendants implemented a loan process that unlawfully prioritized their existing borrowing clients and barred their depository clients and other small businesses from even applying for funds from the governmental loan programs. Nothing in the CARES Act authorizes or permits Defendants to pick and choose who would gain access to or benefit from the federally backed lending program. And, the priority of access to these limited funds is material – the demand is overwhelming as America responds to the economic tsunami of COVID-19 upon small businesses. There is no justification for requiring depository clients and other small businesses to go to the end of the line.   “Unfortunately, the banks were the ones who were supposed to administer it, but it wasn’t their money. It’s Treasury money. It’s your money. It’s taxpayer money,” said Alan Rifkin with Rifkin Weiner Livingston, LLC, an attorney representing the plaintiffs.   Yasmine Young, the owner of Diaspora Salon in Baltimore’s Charles Village neighborhood, is also participating in the class-action suit.   “I was hurt. I was upset, and then I was mad,” she said.   Young has been in business with the bank since before she opened the salon, but since she didn’t have a loan, she wasn’t able to get the PPP money.   “(Bank of America has) the ability to be a beacon of hope for people like me and you are choosing to not do that,” she said.   Bank of America said many other lenders chose not to participate in the program at all. In a brief filed Thursday, the company argues, “…beyond setting minimum eligibility criteria, the Act nowhere prohibits participating lenders from determining how best to prioritize to whom they will lend under the Program.”   The company also said prioritizing its existing customers will speed up the process and get money to businesses quicker.     Bank of America says many lenders have chosen not to participate in the PPP loan program and attorneys just cited its 3,000 employees working to process applications.   They argue the bank is prioritizing clients who have borrowing relationships to speed the process up.   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  April 10, 2020     In response, Young said, “it feels gross.”   “I’m almost disgusted by it because Bank of America says they care about small businesses.”   Several senators, including Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) have criticized Bank of America and asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to lift the restrictions.     The requirement that a  #SmallBusiness  not just have a business account but also a loan or credit card is NOT in the law we wrote & passed or in the regulations.   This is a  @BankofAmerica  requirement not a govt one.    They should drop it. This money is 100% guaranteed by fed govt.  pic.twitter.com/cG2i9eqi7k   — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)  April 3, 2020     Cardin called the bank’s priority “an artificial barrier” and “redlining by another name.”   “We’re going to support their applications being received, processed and fully funded, and we will put as much money as needed to make sure that every small business can participate that’s eligible,” he said.     The demand for  #PaycheckProtectionProgram  loans is a welcome sign that small businesses are beginning to receive the economic relief that they desperately need. I remain committed to ensuring that no small business is left behind as our cities and states address  #COVID19 .   — Senator Ben Cardin (@SenatorCardin)  April 8, 2020     Since the lawsuit was filed last week, attorneys said they’ve received 61,000 requests to join the suit.

(WJZ) —  Life in the age of the coronavirus is creating a new normal for everyone, and it’s no different for those who work on the front lines.  It’s a heartbreaking reality health care workers face every day.   “It’s terrifying, you try to put a poker face on so you’re not upsetting or making your patient feel like your scared,” Linda Chaffman, an ER Nurse at Frederick Health Hospital, said.   Chaffman said as a nurse in the emergency room, the stress is high.   “You’re constantly thinking did you, are you, covered completely? Did you put all your materials on right? Is there anything that you possibly did wrong that could’ve… you’re potentially bringing out of the room to another patient,” she said.   She and her coworkers are dressed head to toe in full protective gear, steps that are necessary to fend off a virus proven to be deadly.

Chaffman said as someone with an underlying health condition, her job can go from stressful to dangerous.   “It terrifies me when I go to work every day. I’m afraid I’m going to get it and I’m going to be one of those patients on a vent,” she said.   Although the pressure is high, Chaffman said she finds comfort in her coworkers, knowing together, they will get through this.   “We are there for each other to talk to, to kind of calm ourselves and reassure that we’re here for another and we’re going to work and make it through,” Chaffman said.
